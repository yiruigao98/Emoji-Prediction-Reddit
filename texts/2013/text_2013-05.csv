t5_2qh0u,JUST_LOGGED_IN,1367370895,"**FIFTY-NlNE** years ago a squad of eight Irishmen and a small army of Chinese coolies made a record in track laying that has never been equalled. In one day, on April 28, 1869, these men, fired with the enthusiasm of the greatest railroad construction race in the history of the world, laid ten miles and fifty-six feet of track in a little less than twelve hours to bring the railhead of the Central Pacific three and one-half miles from Promontory, Utah, where connection was made a few days later with the Union Pacific to form the first transcontinental railroad.  The names of the Irish rail handlers have been passed down through the years. Their super-human achievement will be remembered as long as there is railroad history.  So, too, will that day's work of ""John Chinaman"" be recalled as the most stirring event in the building of the railroad.  During six years the builders of the Central Pacific, at times numbering 14,000 men, had pierced the snow covered, granite walls of the high Sierra and extended their trail of iron over the barren plains 675 miles eastward. For more than five years the Union Pacific had been building westward. Officers of both roads were awake to the future advantages that would accrue to the company having the longest mileage. This rivalry extended through the ranks from the presidents to the track laborers. There followed some marvelous feats of track laying.  **The Challenge**  One day the Union Pacific broke all records by laying six miles of track. Charles Crocker and his Chinese ""pets"" were invited to match that. They beat it by a mile. Then the Union Pacific came back with seven and a half miles, working from three in the morning until almost midnight. But the Central Pacific was not to be beaten.  Crocker declared his men would lay ten miles of rail in a day. Such a ridiculous thing was scoffed at in the rival camps, which were now drawing close together. The story is told that Vice President Durant of the Union Pacific bet $10,000 that it could not be done, and that his money was ""covered.""  For several days Crocker and his construction superintendent, J. H. Strobridge, marshalled their forces and laid their plans. Ties were hauled ahead by two horse teams and distributed along the right-of-way. For some distance the ties were spaced on the already graded road bed. Rails and track materials were moved up from the rear and held in trains ready to advance. More than 4000 men and hundreds of horses and wagons were on the spot. Every man knew his particular job, taught by many months of track work. No one would get in the other fellow's way. In the Central Pacific camp, the patient and methodical Orientals were stirred to a pitch of excitement never shown before, and shared with the few hundred whites the anxiety to ""get at the job.""  **Mishap First Day**  April 27, 1869, was the day selected, but an engine off the track early in the proceedings compelled a postponement until the next day. This mishap brought many laughs from the Union Pacific side, but only served to arouse the determination of Crocker's men. Bright and early the next morning they were set again and at 7:00 o'clock the great task began.  Here is the way it was done, according to a reporter for the San Francisco Bulletin, who was on the scene, and verified by Joseph M. Graham, now living in Berkeley, California, who was an assistant engineer on construction during the building of the Central Pacific:  **How It Was Done**  A train of sixteen cars loaded with iron rail and materials for two miles of track was pushed up to the front. Men climbed on top and threw off the fish plates and kegs of bolts and spikes. Others punched side stakes out of the right and left alternate cars. The rails were then rolled off and in eight minutes the sixteen ears were cleared with a noise like the bombardment of an army. The train was then pulled back out of the way and another train of rails brought into position.  As soon as the material train was gone, small iron hand cars were put on the tracks. Each had a crew of six Chinese working under white bosses. Sixteen rails were loaded each car, together with a keg of bolts, a keg of spikes, and a bundle of fish plates. Two horses with riders were attached to the car in tandem by a long rope. As soon as the car was loaded and the crew on top, the horses were off on the jump. One side of the roadway was kept clear for the horses racing ahead with the material cars. On a down-grade horses were detached and the car went flying along with one of the crew acting as a brakeman. The horses ran alongside and, when a level was reached, the nearest rider hooked on again. The first car out from the material dump only had to a short distance, while the last cars had to go perhaps two miles.  **Stream of Iron**  At the same time empty cars were returning on the single track, all of them at full speed. As a full car came closer, the crew on the empty car jumped off and lifted their car from the rails, while the loaded car went past without slacking speed. There was no halt in the continuous stream of materials to the front.  When the loaded car neared the rail-head, its gang stepped off and another gang jumped on with picks. They broke open the kegs and cut the fastenings on the fish plates. The keg of bolts was thrown to one side to men who filled their buckets and distributed the bolts. Other men distributed the fish plates. The spikes were poured out over the rails and as the rails were removed the spikes dropped through the floorless car and distributed themselves.  At this point the picked crew of Irish rail handlers, working under Track Foreman H. H. Minkler and Gang Foreman George Coley, came into the picture. A single horse pulled the car up to rail-head, where it was blocked by a wooden-framed iron track gauge. Four men worked on each side of the track. Two men seized the forward end of the rail with their tongs while the two rear men slipped the rail to the side of the car so it rested on iron rollers. The two forward men trotted ahead the length of the rail, thirty feet, the rear men dropping the rail in place, where it was bolted and spiked by the track gang. The car was then pulled forward to the next track gauge and the procedure repeated.  The track went forward at the rate of almost a mile an hour. A correspondent for the Alta, another San Francisco newspaper, timed the track layers. He wrote: ""I timed the movement twice and found the speed to be as follows: The first time 240 feet of rail was laid in one minute and twenty seconds; the second time 240 feet was laid in one minute and fifteen seconds. This is about as fast as a leisurely walk and as fast as the early ox teams used to travel over the plains.""  **At the Front**  But the rail handlers were only eight of several hundred men at the front, everyone of whom was an important cog in the smooth-working machinery. Ahead were three ""pioneers,"" the most advanced men, who, with shovel and by hand, butted the ties to a rope line measured from the track-center spikes set by the surveyors. About half the regulation number of ties were placed at first to insure having sufficient for the ten miles.  Just behind the rail layers came the spikers, bolters, and those who distributed the materials. Then came the gang that surfaced the track by raising the ends of the ties and shoveling enough ballast to hold them firm. Immediately following was a ""reverend looking old gentleman"" who sighted the line of the rails and, by motion of his hands, directed the track straighteners. Then the tampers, 400 strong, with shovels and tamping bars.  **Mile an Hour**  The scene was an animated one. From the first ""pioneer"" to the last tamper, about two miles, there was a line of men advancing a mile an hour; iron cars with their load of rails and humans dashed up and down the newly-laid track; foremen on horseback were galloping back and forth. Keeping pace with the track layers was the telegraph construction party. Alongside the moving force, teams were hauling tool and water wagons. Chinamen with pails dangling from poles balanced over their shoulders were moving among the men with water and tea.  Farther back, locomotives were waiting with their cars of materials. Five train loads were used on that day. When one section was completed, the next material train was moved up as far as possible on the new track and materials for another two miles unloaded. In the rear of all this was the boarding house train and quarters of officers, a long line of wood houses built on flat cars, looking like a small town stretched out. In the valley below, continuous trains of wagons and mounted work shops moved along in parallel lines. It could only be compared to the advance of an army.  When a halt was called for the midday meal, six miles of track had been laid and the men were confident they would reach their goal. A number of Union Pacific officers had lunch with Stanford, Crocker, and others of the Central Pacific. They were ready to extend congratulations. ""Victory"" was the name given the spot where lunch was taken. The station is now called Rozel.  **Grades and Curves**  After lunch the work went on, but not so rapidly. The ascending grade on the west slope of Promontory Mountain was more difficult than the section covered during the morning and there were many curves. Considerable time was lost in bending rails, which was done by placing the rail on two blocks and forcing it into the desired curve by blows of a heavy hammer.  When the forward march was halted at 7 o'clock, ten miles and 56 feet of new track had been added to the Central Pacific. Jim Campbell, boarding boss and later superintendent of the division, jumped into a locomotive and ran it back over the new line at a clip of 40 miles an hour just to prove that the job had been well done.  If the roadway had been perfectly level and straight, these men could have laid fifteen miles of track. The task had involved bringing up and putting into position 25,800 ties, 3520 rails averaging 560 pounds each, 55,000 spikes, 14,080 bolts, and other material making a total of 4,462,000 pounds.  **Workers Acclaimed**  Each of the rail handlers lifted 125 tons of iron during the day, in addition to carrying the weight of their heavy rail tongs. They walked many feet more than the ten miles forward, Their's was a wonderful exhibition of skill and strength, and they richly deserved the acclaim showered on them when they proudly rode in a wagon as a feature of Sacramento's railroad celebration a few days later. When the parade was over, their wagon was filled with flowers thrown to them by men and women, boys and girls.  Ten miles of railroad track laying in one day! It is a record that will probably never be challenged. It is not likely there will ever again be such a spirited race for railroad supremacy as the one that inspired the Central Pacific and Union Pacific to such marvelous feats in those early days. Never will there be assembled such an army of railroad workers.  With the eight sons of Erin and the sons of ""John Chinaman"" rest the palms of a great track-laying victory.  Courtesy G.J.

As someone that *also knows* (southern kalifornia native) we kinda invented the shit that most people think of as ""mexican food"" including the rolled taco's people keep in their freezers  The truth is that what people in the USA think of as a ""Taco shell"" is actually just a demonstration of the power of marketing by businesses like Taco Bell™.  ""Hard Shell"" tacos don't exist in the regional cuisine.   But that for a corporation to go national and have their supplies have a long shelf life you can't use fresh corn tortillas due to spoilage - the hard shells keep for a long time and they require less filling then a fresh tortilla laying flat (open).  By doing so, they've created a market from those that are conditioned to think of ""mexican food"" as requiring a box of these hard shells are now required items when serving the family.   I don't even think my local stores even carry such items.  As an example, here's some [legit local fish taco's](http://i.imgur.com/5WB5c.jpg) off of [the local truck (baja style)](http://i.imgur.com/lssD6.jpg)  Those are fresh tortillas with local fish...

t5_2rqpe,AmpleWarning,1367378366,"I think the chances are slim.  In order to embrace this theory, we'd have to revise or ignore several established points in the plot so far.  * Rosalind Harker (the blind lady who got it on with Red John) has described RJ in detail *to Jane*.  Jane even smuggled her into a morgue to see if she could verify that the guy he shot was his nemesis.  Rosalind was pretty intimate with Ol' Roy, so it'd be hard to believe she wouldn't peg Jane as her former lover if she met him again.  * Lorelei was going to prune off a couple of Jane's digits at the behest of RJ, and was only stopped by an FBI raid.  This wouldn't make sense as a plot point if RJ was sharing a body with Jane, since she took the call and then went right into the finger-cutting thing.  * Most of Red John's Friends™ describe him to Jane, in some way.  There's never a hint of irony from any of them, as there would be if they were describing a person *to that person*.  There are other more subtle clues that suggest Jane and RJ are two dudes rather than two splinters of the same dude, but the above are my main reasons for doubt.

I certainly do not mean to put Tarnished Coast in a bad light, and I bowed to understand what happened in there that made things gone awry.I'm the type of player that is not aggressive, and I'd rather die before breaking a rule that may end up in ""Dragonbrand players attack at JP""Fear not, I don't feel of this experience in a negative way. For me, and Tarnish Coast players alike, its a way to get in touch and be friendly to make a wrong, right.I also hope to convey that Dragonbrand generally respects this rule and we hope to continue doing so 😄.Given the past history regarding your server, I definitely understand why you guys feel that way. And honestly, it makes sense.At some point, I expressed to my friend that Tarnished Coast felt such a hostile place. But, while the feeling was mutual between both of us, we wondered the reason why.To illustrate, before heading to the jump puzzle, the following happened to me before arriving:1. Beaten to death by a Zerg. 2. Beaten to death by possibly the same Zerg a second time.3. 1v1 a TC player before 3 Fort Aspenwood players joined the fight, jumped me together with the TC player and then killed him. 4. Killed at least 2 more times in non-specific combat.",😄

t5_2tfln,accountnumber3,1367426513,"##The Programmer and the Elves: a Fairy Tale  http://pigsandfishes.com/filks/mikefilk/progelves.html  *© 1992 Michael Rubin   Transcribed by Lee Gold from the recording The Programmer and the Elves: East Coast Filk, issued in 1993 by Wail Songs, recorded live in 1992 at Arisia, Boskone, and Lunacon.*  Once upon a time, at a company far away, there was a poor project manager named Jones. His department only did maintenance and hadn't gotten a new project in years. The computer was so old that it only ran Fortran.  Jones's one pride and joy was their young Chief Programmer Sandy, who not only had long golden hair that was the envy of all the secretaries, but was far and away the finest coder the department had ever seen.  Now most programmers this good would go work for lots of money at one of the rich companies in the Valley, with the beach parties and the hot tubs. But Sandy knew that the programmers there had to work twelve hours a day, and always lived in fear that their company would be shut down by a look-and-feel lawsuit.  And most older programmers this good would stay at Berkeley and work on nifty academic systems until they turned into tenured professors. But Sandy didn't like programs that were all theoretical and never really got implemented, and anyhow had flunked out of Berkeley.  Well, one year at the office Christmas party, after a few too many glasses of eggnog, Jones boasted to the boss that Sandy was probably a good enough programmer to write hypertext programs in Fortran.  The Boss took one look at Sandy with the blue jeans and the sandals and the long golden hair, and shouted, ""Jones, you're a liar! This is no Chief Programmer; this is a hippie! I'm gonna lock this imposter in a room with a terminal and a Fortran compiler, and if I don't see a hyperwhatzis program by tomorrow at noon, I'm gonna fire the both of you.""  Well, everybody knows that it's barely possible to write text processing programs in Fortran, much less hypertext, and especially in less than a day, locked in a room with no cola and no Twinkies.  So Sandy was scared witless, and cursed and wailed over the keyboard until early in the morning, and was all ready to crash out, when up from under a floor tile popped a little person with pointy ears and pointy shoes and a tall pointy hat.  ""What seems to be your trouble, hacker?"" asked the elf.  ""My supervisor told the boss I could write hypertext programs in Fortran, which everybody knows is impossible, and now I have until noon to write one or I'll get fired.""  The elf replied, ""A bit of an odd request, but surely not impossible. I think I can help you out."" And while falling asleep from caffeine depletion, Sandy may or may not have seen coming up from under that floor tile, a dozen more elves and a laptop Sparc-station.  They opened the door at noon and found Sandy asleep and a program running merrily away on the terminal.  The Boss, who of course didn't know a hypertext program from a kiwi fruit, called in some other programmers to figure out what the thing was.  ""It is indeed a hypertext program,"" they replied, ""but none of us can understand how it works. It has variables named Shamrock and Rainbow and Misty_Morning_Dew, and some of the most ferocious assembly language subroutines to be found outside the jungles of Borneo."" [Yes, that's your part.]  The Boss was so astonished as to give Sandy a week's vacation on the spot. Sandy took the listing home and decided the elves must have been real, because no human being would write a program with variable names like that.  At least, not unless somebody had been putting really nifty drugs in the water cooler.  In the meantime, the news of this program spread far and wide around the department. Finally, it reached the ears of a secretary named Robinson, who had always hated Sandy from envy of that long golden hair.  An evil thought turned into a nasty plan, and Robinson whispered in the Boss's ear, ""That program could never be written in just one night. You've been fooled. Sandy must have written it months ago, and they just brought it out as a party trick.""  The Boss -- who also didn't know an ace programmer from a kiwi fruit -- was actually fooled by this evil rumor. So Jones was called into the Boss's office, and the upshot of it was that Sandy came back from a week's vacation only to be given an even more impossible task to do in one night: namely, put a graphical user interface on that program.  Well, everybody knows that it's utterly hopeless to write a graphical user interface in Fortran, even worse than processing hypertext, and especially in less than a day, locked in a room with no cola and no Twinkies.  So Sandy was scared even more witless than before, and cursed and wailed over the keyboard until early in the morning, and was all ready to crash out, when up from under a floor tile popped the same little person with pointy ears, etc., etc., etc.  ""And what seems to be your trouble this time, hacker?"" asked the elf.  ""My supervisor told the boss I could write a graphical user interface in Fortran, which everybody knows is impossible, and now I have until noon to write one or I'll get fired.""  The elf replied, ""An amazingly stupid request, but surely not impossible. I think I can help you out on this one too.""  ""But wait,"" said Sandy. ""What do you want in return? Royalties? Supper and a place by my fire? My first-born child?""  ""Oh, nothing of the sort,"" said the elf. ""We elves just do this to keep up our skills for consultant jobs.""  And while falling asleep from caffeine depletion, Sandy may or may not have seen coming up from under that floor tile, a dozen more elves, a laptop Sparc-station, a copy of the Gnu curses library, and a C-to-Fortran translator.  They opened the door at noon and found Sandy asleep and a program running merrily away on the terminal.  The Boss could at least tell it had a graphic user interface, but called in the other programmers anyway for reassurance.  ""Well, it is just what it looks like,"" they replied, ""but we still don't understand how it works. It has variables named Shamrock and Rainbow and Misty_Morning_Dew, and some of the most ferocious assembly language subroutines to be found outside the jungles of Borneo.... And by the way, while we were testing last week's version, we found it was a pretty useful tool for writing documentation; and with this graphical user interface, we could even use it to put our manuals online.""  So the company started using the new program for all their manuals and documentation, all except for Robinson who quit in shame rather than go near it.  Well, in the Happy Ending for this story, the Boss takes early retirement, Sandy is promoted to Vice President of R&amp;D, and Jones is promoted to Vice President of Personnel for having the brains to hire Sandy in the first place, and they all live happily ever after.  But what really happened... is that Sandy is still a lowly programmer -- and is now stuck for the foreseeable future maintaining this horrid crock of a Fortran program, written by elves! After all, nobody else can understand how it works. It has variables named Shamrock and Rainbow and Misty_Morning_Dew, and some of the most ferocious assembly language subroutines to be found outside the jungles of Borneo.  **And the moral of the story is: Never do the impossible. People will expect you to do it forever after.** ",©

t5_2trms,Mistervimes65,1367433324,"I am highly opposed to ""Merchants and Magic"" -- it's a time suck from the game and it takes all the specialness out of magic items. Look at the experience level required to create these items: these are all handcrafted magic items, there is no production assembly line knocking out +1 swords. Then think about what percentage of the population has to be fairly high level wizards to produce this cornucopia of magic paraphernalia.   This is why I establish up-front that there is no magic item based economy. A GM has a pretty good idea of what items their players want and need. If they don't have a wizard making items for them, introduce ""heirloom"" weapons (i.e. weapons that level with the players) and let the player have input (but not final say) into what abilities the item gets when it ""levels"". You can control the leveling process (rate and power level) to fit your game and the players will quit looking for Magic Items R Us™",™

As of July 1, 2013, BearBucks™ will be accepted only at locations on the Baylor University campus in Waco. The off-campus BearBucks™ program provided a valuable service to students when it was created in 2002, but in recent years student participation has declined as more students have relied on the convenience of personal debit and/or credit cards. The decision to terminate the off-campus program is a joint one between Baylor and Wells Fargo Bank, our program administrator. This decision is also driven by the fact that the existing merchant equipment is obsolete and no longer repairable and the Bank can no longer provide staffing for a program that is now the only one of its kind. Baylor will continue to accept BearBucks™ at the following locations on campus:  Baylor Dining Services Baylor Bookstore, SUB Food Court (BDSC)	, Baylor Computer Repair Center, Atrium, Café (Science), Baylor Theater Box Office, Moe's (Science), Central Duplicating, Which Wich (Science), Game Room (BDSC), P.O.D. Market (Speight, EV), All Laundry Facilities on campus, The Village Bakery (EV), Mail Room (BDSC), Red Mango (EV), McLane Student Life Center, Season's Sushi (NV), Select Athletic Concessions, Starbucks (Dutton, Moody), Select Campus Copy Machines, Law School Café, Select Campus Vending Machines, Terrace Café (RT), Brooks Great Hall, Collins Cafe, Memorial RFoC, Penland Food Court, [and] East Village Dining Commons.  We understand that some students may need access to the funds in their BearBucks™ account in order to make purchases off campus after June 30th. If you wish to request a refund of all or a portion of your BearBucks™ balance by Direct Deposit (recommended) or by check to your home address as listed in BearWeb, you may e-mail Cashiers_Office@baylor.edu after June 30th. You may also come to the Cashier's Office during business hours to receive your refund (photo ID required, limits apply). As long as your student account is current, your BearBucks™ balance will be refunded upon request. We regret any inconvenience this may cause. We anticipate that the on-campus BearBucks™ program will continue to be a valuable benefit to Baylor students. Sincerely,  Cashier's Office  [edited for grammar]",™

t5_2qhmf,kounfranz,1367454132,"**GREETINGS** (koun)  Good morning. I want to start this Student-to-Student event by thanking everyone for posting questions and for opening up this space. Until recently, I had no idea what Reddit was – it took a few notifications from the blog to come look at it, and even then, I wasn’t sure what I was seeing. It’s a fascinating way of holding a dialogue. And the volume is overwhelming.  I’ve lurked a bit in the last few days to get a sense of what the conversation looks like. I can see that I have my work cut out for me – a lot of emphatic statements that the tradition in which I was trained is “not Zen.” But that’s fine. Dogen didn’t like to call it “Zen” either. I’ll call it Zen here, for the sake of efficiency, but /u/ewk, you can call it what you want. ☺  There are some really interesting questions here. I’ll try to take on a few. And if one comes up along the way, feel free to add to the list – no need to worry about the May 1 deadline. I’m not exactly known for being concise, but here on Reddit, to encourage conversation, I’m going to really, really try to keep things shorter than I would, say, on the blog. I would rather have a conversation than give you a lot to read.  One more thing: I live in Japan, so I go to bed right around the time that many of you wake up. And for the next few days, most of my participation will probably take place in the evenings. So even if it seems that I’ve disappeared, I haven’t. I just live on the other side of the world.  Thank you all again for this chance to meet.  Gassho, -koun ",☺

Get a new Samsung Galaxy S4 on a 3-yr plan and get a free $35 Google Play gift card. LIMITED TIME OFFER  &gt;If your Samsung Galaxy S4 doesn't ship within 21 days from official launch in Canadian stores or reservation, whichever is later, we'll apply a $50 credit to your account as thanks for your patience.  This is on the Rogers Wireless website.  What's the price on a 3-year term you ask? $199.99  Your other option is to go ""month-to-month"" for a whopping $699.99  So what they're telling me is, as an existing customer of theirs with just under 2 years left on my contract, I have to either re-up on another 3 year contract, or pay $700 to get that phone. On top of that, if I pre-order from them now (as it's not released in Canada yet), there's a chance I still won't get it for up to 21 days from its release date.

t5_mouw,annuziatafausto,1367462661,"http://crowncapitalmngt.wordpress.com/  Biomass boiler costs don’t end with installation. Mark Brown takes a frank look at the pros and cons of a biomass boiler for a 5 bed detached house.  Biomass boiler installation   Biomass boiler installation was largely trouble free but took longer than anticipated  Work started in the warm August of 2009 when we didn’t need heating. Hot water was supplied by an immersion heater as we didn’t have the Solar Thermal panels up at this point (they came in 2010). The estimated install was meant to be two weeks but it took six in total. We allocated one half of a double garage to the project in an area co-located with the existing gas-boiler for convenience. Installation was largely trouble-free. The UK representative of the Manufacturer (KWB) came out for commissioning and observed that one section of pipework was incorrect. It was quickly rectified.  We live in a Conservation area and had planning permission refused for an external flue so we had it route through the corner of the bedroom over the garage. Not a big problem as our installer arranged for builders to come in and box in the flue. We redecorated ourselves. Biomass boiler system The KWB Easyfire is a 15kW boiler with a 500l buffer tank. The system provides space and water heating but we also have both gas backup as well as solar thermal and lounge wood stove.  Our system is using wood pellets fed from a hopper. The hopper stores enough for at least seven days in the depth of winter but can last up to two months in a warm summer. It is fully automated, other than filling it up with pellets or emptying the ash (once a year!) no work is required. Our KWB is very reliable.  Biomass boiler costs This KWB Easyfire 15kW biomass boiler cost £15,590 installed  We installed in 2009 on the assumption that the Renewable Heat Incentive would pay for the investment. We could have had a cheaper boiler make but had to opt for one licenced for use in a smoke-control zone. Total cost of the boiler, buffer tank, flue, labour &amp; VAT came to £15,590 minus £1000 from the (then) Low Carbon Building program grant.  We use bagged wood pellets and need just under 5 tonnes a year. They cost about £230/tonne (delivered + VAT) working out at £1100 pa approx. We take three tonnes per delivery with about two deliveries a year. Note that there are slightly cheaper options but we prefer UK-sourced pellets.  We are lucky enough to have a maintenance contract that covers five years’ work. It works out at about £150 a year this way, but you could pay up to £500 pa if unwilling to pay up front for a contract. This contract includes cleaning the flue and boiler. Pros and cons of biomass boilers Pros  Of all the technologies you install for heating biomass offer the greatest reduction in carbon footprint per £ spent The KWB we used is able to control the existing Gas boiler and use it as backup Biomass boiler installations cause no more disruption than would maintenance on your regular boiler. No need to rip up your floors or garden as you might for a ground-source heat pump installation. Biomass boilers use very little electricity Biomass boilers can use waste wood (turned into pellets) Biomass boilers can use locally-sourced biomass helping your local economy Biomass boilers are a resilient technology when used with other local microgeneration such as photovoltaics Biomass is very clean – you cannot see nor smell any smoke – ever! The ash from a biomass boiler takes up hardly any space. When necessary tip it on your garden as fertiliser. Cons Biomass boilers are expensive coming in at anything upward of £9000. You could get quotes for well over £20,000 so shop around. Even if replacing oil it is hard to see a payback without an additional incentive such as the RHI or a cheap on-site source of fuel such as wood chip.  A double garage provides ample storage but moving and stacking bagged wood pellets requires physical effort  It was really hard to find a domestic installer (or was in 2008/09). Don’t forget you will need a buffer tank and storage space for the fuel. We suggest allowing the sort of space in which a small car would fit. Biomass boilers are not really suitable for small homes on the gas grid. They are more beneficial if you have a very large building (ie, farm house, community hall, church, school, etc.) off mains gas. Biomass fuel will cost as much as using Oil so there are no direct costs savings if you are on mains gas. Your Biomass boiler deserves to be maintained properly. The UK market is only very slowly gearing up so you might be limited in choice. Your average Corgi registered plumber will not touch it. Our KWB boiler’s controllers are sophisticated to the point of being too complicated. Refuelling from bags can be physically demanding. This makes them unsuitable for social housing, the physically impaired or the elderly. Fuel delivery can be inconvenient (as for any solid fuel) so we normally take the day off work or pay extra for Saturday delivery. Delivery to narrow cul de sacs are a problem in our experience so we always specify a small 8 tonne truck – sometimes this message doesn’t get through and we have had to push pallets from the road on a pallet trolley with the help of the delivery driver. This is almost impossible for a one tonne pallet, we recommend ¾ tonne pallets or less. A tail lift truck is recommended. We always end up part-hand-stacking some of the load to reduce its footprint in the garage. For one fit man this might take 40 minutes to shift 1.5tonnes of bagged pellets (15kg per bag). The other option is to use a large hopper with the pellets blown in – but this is only suitable for much larger installations than we have. Having solar thermal can mean the biomass boiler is hardly used through part of the summer. However it will keep the buffer tank up to operating temperature which is wasteful (although this can be switched off). Our system was sized appropriately based upon our SAP rating so this isn’t a significant problem. Conclusion Given the information we had in 2009 (and the pending Renewable Heat Incentive) we think we made a good choice. However the RHI has not materialised and, as far as we know, might NEVER pay us a penny for this boiler in its final manifestation.  When deciding upon this form of heating we did compare it to a ground-source heat pump. We didn’t cost up a comparable GSHP but it would only have been suitable if we had been prepared to dig up the floor for underfloor heating plus the garden for the ground loop. A GSHP would need a lot of electricity to run but we wanted to generate most of our own power so it would have put that objective out of reach. Hence biomass was the most local &amp; resilient option.  We have great satisfaction with the boiler and our only regret is the loss of space in the garage. We would recommend domestic biomass for rural areas with large buildings off mains gas. © Mark Brown Aug 2012  Further Information: Full details of this project are available at Post Carbon Living.

t5_2to85,Sixelona,1367465078,"Alright, let's see if I can make a comment without rustling Jimmies. I'm going to start off with what I would say if I had seen this earlier.  'Hey! This is a really cute edit. I'm actually pretty flattered you'd use my art, but if you don't mind just a lil credit in the comments that would be really awesome! Thanks! &lt;3'  I like to think of myself as pretty laid back as an artist, but I do appreciate getting credit where credit is due! And I do think this is a really well done and cool edit. However I have to stick to my morals as an artist.  I would like to say that I think some people over reacted to a comment made by Rainbowcrisp who is very protective of me and my art. For good reason. I've had my art stolen in the past.  While this is NOT stolen art (it's just a parody) she simply pointed out that credit would be nice. In no way did she call the OP a thief or say anything mean. She just pointed out a fact. I think, those who over reacted, should not have jumped down her throat for simply stating her thoughts.  Guys, chill out.  First off, I just got off work and I had a migraine when I got home, so I just saw this now. Secondly, really? Jumping on someone for a harmless comment? I dont think there was a need for a debate. Even SpinelessCoward commented in a civil way. I appreciate that they replied in a way that explains their thought process which is totally understandable. It IS a well known image now, but there will always be someone who doesn't know the original artist :) It's like asking a kid 'Who painted the Mona Lisa'. You're going to have someone who doesn't know and will look it up. It's just the way we are.  Anyway, this is already really long, here's the TLDR;  I think the edit it cool, simple crediting to original artist is awesome/appreciated, RC didn't comment to make SpinelessCoward look bad but just wanted them to credit, and I get home late for work.  I love this community so cant we all just get along guys? Please? Okay ♥♥♥",♥

On January 18th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, I am the messenger angel of God, Sarachi.  Beloveds, it has been revealed to the Son, Yeshua, and to the angels of God! This day will be a very special day!  Revelation 19, verse 8 It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.  It will be a poignant and indescribably joyous event for those, who were patient, and are expecting Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and have accepted Him! It will be a very painful event for you, who are listening now, because you have rejected Jesus Christ. Yet it is not entirely too late for you, for it is written for you:  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, ""also on the cross, He went for you, in order to take your punishment upon Himself"", that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, the time is near! In North Korea 300,000 to 500,000 Christians get tortured. Obama adjusts the Arms Act, so that the prohibited weapons can be used in countries, where they do like to have these weapons! The antichrist likes to use children, in order to hide his true nature. Obama cares so much about people, that those camps are ready, with of American-made beheading machines, signed by the antichrist Obama! And these are already distributed by his order. So in North Korea many thousands are in Nazi-like FEMA punishment camps. These punishment camps are hidden, worldwide! The radical Islam is increasing rapidly, worldwide, and they persecute the Christians, as in Africa, Mali, Tanzania, Niger, Kenya, Uganda, America, North Korea, China... Worldwide one wants to exterminate the Christians!  Luke 21, verse 25 to 28 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.  Verily, let nothing prevent you from accepting Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, in your life! Now choose this day whom you want to serve. Get yourself ready to meet Him, because He'll come unexpectedly, and puts you to the test now!  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!  SHALOM!

LISTEN TO THIS INFORMATION, COMING FROM GOD! Please share, do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello! On the 23rd of August 2012 the messenger angel of God brought this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, Benjamin Cousijnsen! May I introduce myself? My name is Jetro, a messenger angel of God. I salute you, God's prophet, in the most powerful Name above all names, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  Do you remember when you saw a planet with bat-like fallen angels above the earth? ""Yes,"" I said, ""I remember this,"" Benjamin, this planet has been destroyed. Don't cheer too early, Benjamin, they did it themselves. ""Were they killed?"" I asked...  No, they are on earth! Their goal is to take mankind away from God. They lurk for blood, and they bring mental confusion on the earth.  They also have contact with the UFOs. The messenger angel said: You spoke in the name of almighty God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham, and you said, ""From now on one will see more UFOs"".  Benjamin, worldwide they are discovered and even filmed... In Mexico a journalist saw many UFOs during filming. He made real live images and they saw the UFOs, eight UFOs, with an infrared camera, and even Defense saw them.  The UFOs can project clouds, so one cannot see them. Their protection was not working and so they saw them, such as Mexico, Spain, England, Galicia, America, Haiti, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Many think it's great, when they see one. They do not even realize that they are fallen angels, who will take over the earth. At the time when the christians are gone, AFTER the Rapture, they will seize power!  The appearance will be a copy of the human. They will believe and trust the beast, because 'they had removed the christians', because there were disasters worldwide and chaos. They are received as heroes! Woe, world, they are demons of Satan!  ""How about those fallen angels among us here on earth?"" I asked. They are scouts, and they pass on the information, Benjamin.  It is better for man, that they convert to Jesus Christ. Only He can save man. Whoever has not accepted Him, will receive a hell on earth. Whoever receives Him, will be saved.  People will kill and even consume each other!  John 9, verse 30 The man answered them, ""How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.  The time is near! Maybe you are laughing, as in Noah's time. Yet man perished and God himself had closed the door.  I'm leaving now, Benjamin. Who does not want to hear, will be lost. Remember this well! Choose whom you want to serve. Shalom! The messenger angel of God said, and disappeared.

On June 19th, 2012, Benjamin Cousijnsen received the following message from the messenger angel of God. The angel of God began to speak, and began with:  Shalom Benjamin! Are you ready? God's angels do.  The total takeover of the human is reality NOW. Everything is in full swing. Many technological demons are increasing the pressure on the earth. They want to take you over there very quickly, for fear of the Rapture of the children of God, who are then suddenly gone. The Rapture is very near! Satan has a very strange presentiment... The battlefield has begun to Satan, but you, who are in Christ Jesus: Clean yourselves, get yourselves ready! And you there, submit to Jesus Christ now, before His door is closed.   The U.S. law conforms to God's Word, Revelation 13 And he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to receive a mark in their right hands or on their foreheads; and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom: He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred and sixty six.  The Act under Obama requires that all citizens are implanted with a RFID-chip. It is already in full swing now! Further you are being monitored through television, bus, phone, computer, Facebook, car... and even through the vaccination syringe. EVERYTHING is equipped with a chip!  NASA and UTA are working to analyse by intercepting the global data traffic. The media is also intercepted and used. Say, EVERYTHING is being controlled in your WONDER world! Also there are people now, with electrodes in their brains, that one can control via the satellite.  2013 one needs to be ready, and everyone must really be provided worldwide. In some countries, Benjamin, said the angel, it is already mandatory. Also the Philippines, Texas, Japan, Indonesia, Spain, Rome, Europe, will follow very soon.  Also the super soldiers are already ready. They are cloned super soldiers.  Benjamin, also Satan says: ""Here you can 'zip in and out', but that 'zipping out', you can forget about that with him! If you accept the number of the beast, 666, you have accepted namely the Law of Obama, the number of the beast. Herewith you have rejected Jesus Christ forever! You really cannot 'zip out' by Satan. God has warned you, now and through His Word!  You see who's behind it, behind all this?  This message is for everyone. Where are the christians? Where are they hiding? Is God's Word not for everyone? Do not be selfish, submit to God!  Also the satellites are focused on mankind. Even the weather they are able to manipulate now.  I tell you, now quickly choose for Jesus Christ, and surrender to Him. Who remains in this global tribulation, wishes himself namely dead. Please note, may I have your attention? I say to you: Time is up! Do you love to be taken over very much? Then let this be done through Jesus Christ. Come to Him now, and He will save you. And you shall be saved. Jesus Christ wants to save you!  Tell this message forth, save souls, if you really love Jesus Christ!  I tell you further, for those left behind, the camps of the U.S. are ready. But I tell you, also crematoriums will be used for the sick, and christians, who were too late to give their life to the satan, but to burn them. Because they hadn't taken the number.  And also in the total chaos, during the Rapture, there will be so-called 'liberators of the world' among the men, with visible UFOs. It will be a hell for those left behind, and also by the famine, people will eat each other's flesh... The demons of Satan love it!  The Government leaders and the authority will find, that the christians suddenly are gone. The antichrist will cry it out: ""They're gone! They are gone!""  But I say to you, children of God, you may now rejoice, already now you may rejoice.  Yet a little while, then you will see Jesus Christ, really see! Then you will be with Him. And I say unto you, Where your heart is, will be your soul too. Shalom!

t5_2r65t,SpecCRA,1367474251,"If you are actually worried about growing a bit more, I don't think getting a cheaper suit would be a terrible idea for you. Something from H&amp;M, ASOS, or the Jcrew factory all seem fine. They're all reasonably priced and would allow you to spend more on your shoes, which will definitely not change size. JCrew factory doesn't have any 34 chest size though. After tailoring and what not, I'd estimate you'd be out about $220 or a little more for a three piece. Those are also the only places outside of Macy's you'd find a slim fit suit.   Notched lapels, two side vents are standard things, so you'll have no trouble getting those. I would recommend you avoid three button jackets at 5'8. Two buttons is ideal. Three buttons is rarer than two to begin with.  For the color, charcoal or navy will do fine. They are both versatile. A white shirt will be easy too. I don't know how much you'd like to spend on the shirt. A white shirt is pretty standard. I've been having a lot of trouble finding a good quality, slim fit white shirt with a spread collar.   http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-dress-shirts  Uniqlo is currently having a sale on their dress shirts.   http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-easy-care-dobby-long-sleeve-shirt/075098-54-006?ref=mens-clothing%2Fmens-tops%2Fmens-dress-shirts  I had just bought one of these. They're not bad, and it's way better than H&amp;M quality imo. Other places to get good slim fit shirts are Club Monaco and Brooks Brothers. These are going to be ~$100 without a sale. A light blue shirt is quite nice too.   http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Supima®-Cotton-Non-Iron-Extra-Slim-Fit-Ainsley-Collar-Dress-Shirt/614Q,default,pd.html?dwvar_614Q_Color=WHIT&amp;contentpos=1  Here's an example of one.   http://www.thetiebar.com  Here's where I'd get all my ties and pocket squares. There's tremendous variety, skinny ties, and good quality. Good for the budget too! There was a guide recently up here on pattern matching. You may want to take a look at that before you buy your tie.   Now for shoes, prom is usually a pretty formal event. I'd prefer black. Brown goes pretty damn well with navy though. Everyone will tell you to get some wing tips like the Allen Edmonds. It sure would cost a lot though.   http://www.zappos.com/rockport-fairwood-2-wingtip-dark-brown  I think you'll do fine starting off with something like this. Edit: Jk the shoes are not awesome.

Does the SGGS make it explicit, or is it left as an interpolation?

t5_2s3qj,fwaggle,1367479002,"1) The lame-ass copyright argument:  &gt;“© 2013 Ripple”.  vs  &gt; Copyright (c) 2009-2013 Bitcoin Developers  2) The ""open-source"" argument is solid at the moment, but I've said several times in this thread that I feel like Ripple.com have their own reasons for holding out on the server sources for now. It should also be noted that other ""open source"" projects have done this before (hey, this is coming, sign up for newsletters, here's some half-done shit you can play with but no sources yet), it's not like they've released binaries only but no sources... they're simply an ""open source"" project that hasn't released yet.  3) The ""omg, run for profit, not decentralized argument"":  &gt; Every single Ripple nodes is controlled by a private for profit company. It is centralized, like a bank.  You'd have to be an absolute idiot to think that Bitcoin is going to stay truly decentralized in the distant future. In *any* future where Bitcoin is successful, the main ""mining"" nodes are going to be running on ultra-thin profits, via economy of scale, either using renewable energy or sweetheart-negotiated deals with utility companies, or they'll be run by companies with a vested interest in the currency so they can afford to lose a little bit by mining.  The idea that everyone's going to buy their BFLs and Avalons and keep the whole thing decentralized over the next decade is just wishful thinking.  4) The ""51% attack"" thing. This is a nitpick against a point that's critical of Bitcoin, because this grossly over-simplifies the idea:  &gt; In Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, miners control the network, and if a miner gains 51% of the total network power, then they can choose to double spend transactions.  It glosses over the entire reason why this isn't as big of a deal in Bitcoin as people tend to think it is (it's only actually pointed out by Bitcoin proponents as a cover-your-arse thing, so no one can come along and say ""uhh, what about the 51% thing?"" where you're on the back foot pointing out it's not a big deal), and then uses faulty logic to apply this exact scenario to Ripple in a wrong way.  All the same reasons 51% is ""not that big of a deal"" to BTC, also apply to Ripple.  5) ""HIDDEN INFLATION OMFG""  &gt;XRPs (“RIPPLES”) ARE PREMINED HAVE A HIDDEN 100% INFLATION  What the fuck does that even mean?  6) Pre-mining:  &gt;Every single premined cryptocurrency has failed, and Ripple is no exception.   And before Bitcoin, every single internet currency was a failure.  7) ""I hate debt so much""  &gt;INHERENTLY FLAWED “DEBT IS MONEY” MODEL THAT WILL COLLAPSE  Again, flawed assertion. You could configure the interface to your billing software/shopping cart to automatically ""cash out"" BTC from your gateway as an IOU comes to you. Effectively, unless you get lazy or want the convenience of fast spends, your exposure to a 3rd party going under with your BTC is no bigger than if you leave your money on MtGox or Bitstamp.  Given the *huge* number of people who start screaming when a BTC service goes down, I think it's safe to say that a good number of people are not as concerned about this as you might be.  Those are just the few I felt like picking on - sorry I didn't reply earlier I'm running on about 4 hours of sleep.",©

t5_2ud8h,AnonymousBroccoli,1367509676,"As far as Steam sales go... If you don't think you'll play something within a month or two, you'd might as well wait, and it'll almost assuredly go on sale again somewhere at some point. Unless it's a *really* good deal, like 80%+ off, sub-$5 (or less for smaller indie-type games), or in a nice bundle of stuff. This is if you're really looking to maximize your gaming buck.  One thing you can do with Steam stuff is purchase the games as gifts, and then you at least have the option to trade them later if you want. (I'm indecisive, and am not a huge fan of the re-sale limits of digital purchases, so this is how I compromise.)  A downside of Steam's big bundles is that generally speaking, if you already own a game in a bundle, the extra licence simply disappears. It will specifically say otherwise if you get to keep something—usually ""Already own [game title]? Give it to a friend!"" This is one benefit of buying from third-party shops like Amazon, GMG, GamersGate, etc.: you get individual keys, which you can keep or trade as you please.  /u/Tvacgamer is the Amazon rep. Other sites may have reps who'll appear at times as well.  If you're new to PC gaming, you might want to look into the various DRM schemes publishers use. They'll often be disclosed on store pages, but sometimes not everything is covered. For example, buying [*Arkham Asylum*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35140/) on Steam, you get DRM in the form of the Steam client, ""SecuROM™ 4 machine activation limit""—which can be revoked, but it's not entirely straightforward— and Games for Windows Live—which may have its own activation limits. Each layer has the potential to create grief—running out of activations, requiring an extra account to keep track of, being outdated, not working at all.

t5_2ruhy,Aeyther,1367514567,"Sorry for the massive ""Wall of Text®""  ***Spoilers Below***   Good lord, this writer likes to ramble, I'm surprised he gave it 2/5. I felt like he hated every single aspect of this game and only wrote this review to complain about it.  He didn't even play though the whole game, seems like he got halfway through Alucard and quit.  Doesn't mention anything at all about the prologue where you play as Gabriel (to kill a couple monsters, really short) and Trevor at the end, which was my favorite part even though it seemed to have the most cutscenes.  Anyway, this is what I got from his review and my opinions:  **The Story** - Everywhere I go there’s another scroll from a dead soldier saying the same thing. “Dracula did something evil and I died!”  For the most part this is true, but it's lore.  Also, Alucard remembers stuff after he looks at the mirror, but I think the writer missed that part.  **The Action** - Reference about how this game isn't SotN? Check. All four characters do play the same way for the most part, the subweapons do provide a slight difference.  I had fun with Alucard's mist.  **The Music** - I thought the music was pretty good, maybe the writer forgot to turn on his volume?  **The Exploration** - He's mostly correct here, there are some nooks/paths that go off the main path, but they're short.  It does follow a linear path mostly.  **The Little Things** - Oh this should be good...  *Taking damage from falls when the characters can clearly leap several stories in the cut scenes* - Agreed, some of the deaths I had when I fell 5 feet down from a ledge were cheap.  *Tapping B to open chests and doors* - Again, I agree here.  I think tapping a button for every chest/door wasn't necessary, could have used some touchscreen love here.  *The animation is rough* - I'm guessing the framerate problem?  I had no problems on my XL with the retail version.  *Alucard looks dumb* - lol wut?  *Simon Belmont has a Scottish accent* - It was pretty good, more voice acting please.  *Bad guy wants you dead, sets you on fire… then tosses you into a moat* - Um, ok?  *The name’s too long* - Yeah, sure.  Let's do a quick comparison...  (including spaces) Castlevania: Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate - 44 char Castlevania: Symphony of the Night - 34 char long  Yup, a whole 10 characters longer than SotN, which I'm sure the writer wouldn't have mentioned anything about name length if he were to review SotN.  Edit: Overall, LoS:MoF isn't nearly as bad as this writer makes.  I wish people would stop comparing it to SotN, a great game, and view it as it's own model.  It may have the Castlevania name and similar motives, but you just can't compare Lords of Shadow to any ""Metroidvania"" because they are different styles of games.  One's an RPG while another is an action style fighting game.",®

t5_2t1w0,SwiftJonathan,1367535537,"&gt;Why not just mount a weapon that kills the section faster and easier?   Imagine Team A has a sniper or LRM boat that can strip the armor on assaults from Team B. Team B's assault pilots are smart and will respond to the barrage by taking cover and rotating to hide their exposed sections. Two of Team A's light 'Mechs come over to neuter the exposed sections.   Arbitrarily, let's assume the 'mech that was hit was an LRM-boating AS7-D-DC, who now has a barely-opened left torso. For the point of this though experiment, let's assume that both of the lights from A are RVN-4Xs that ran 2ML, 1 SSRM2, and 2 MGs. Let's also pretend that one of them lost his left arm and no longer has his MGs, the other lost his right, and therefore his MLs. Neither of them can use their SSRMs because of the D-DC's ECM.  If the guy with MLs wants to take out that torso's weapons, he'll have to dig them out. The D-DC's 42 Internal Structure will take 5 continuous hits from the RVN with MLs. The Medium Laser's 1 second (s) per beam and 3s per cooldown will mean that the light will have to invest 17 seconds in front of the Atlas to kill that section (5 attacks + 4 cooldowns = 17s).    If the RVN with MGs steps up to attack that same section instead, then the total HP of the items in that section come into play. Let's say that the D-DC is rocking 3 LRM 15s with Artemis in that torso. The total HP of 3 ALRM-15s is 30. Normally, this means that 2 MGs would take 75s to outright kill these components and 105s of continuous fire to kill the section. However, because of the boosted crit chance for the MGs, they have a 69% chance to at least crit once, a 30% chance to crit at least twice, and a 6% chance to crit for triple damage. If the RVN has normalized odds, then over the course of 1 second he'll see 4 bullets crit once, 2 double crits and 1 triple crit. Remember that MGs do 12.5Xdmg on a crit. So, every second, each MG should be doing 5.62 damage to internal components (4 SCrits, 2 DCrits, 1 TCrit, 3 non-Crits). This means that 2 MGs are dealing 11.24dps to internal structure. Against the 30 HP of the ALRMs, this RVN-4X will only have to spend **2.66 seconds** in front of that Atlas. For this RVN to fall behind his cohort in Rate of Neutering, there'd have to be 191hp worth of components to hit.  **TL;DR**: *On paper*, MGs rip through components faster than anything else a light 'Mech could mount.   Addendum: Now that it is less safe for lights to hang around the enemy (even more so with the BAP buff inbound), this economy of time may become a lot more attractive.  Though, as someone that uses MGs, it seems like the RNG may not be normalized between matches, or perhaps crits can hit components that can't be killed, such as XL engines and actuators, because it feels like MGs only unleash the *RIP-N-TEAR*® some of the time. If anyone felt like testing that out in-game, I'd be grateful.  ^^^P.S. ^^^- ^^^Technically, ^^^if ^^^you ^^^could ^^^get ^^^all ^^^the ^^^pellets ^^^on ^^^target, ^^^LB ^^^10-Xs ^^^actually ^^^deal ^^^more ^^^crit ^^^dps ^^^than ^^^MGs, ^^^but ^^^no ^^^one ^^^uses ^^^those ^^^on ^^^5Ks, ^^^right? ^^^^^^^Just ^^^^^^^Me?",®

t5_2qj8f,notbrainwash26,1367541530,"Whenever you hear about the business of ViSalus, you'll like come across three letters: BMW. Prospective distributors are getting pitches of ""free BMWs."" However, that could be further from the truth. The BMWs are not free. If you were to qualify for a BMW from ViSalus, you'd be wise to refuse it. Why? I'll get to that in a second. First, let me cover... This is the pitch straight from the compensation plan:""Since ViSalus™ knows our distributors are people who align themselves with only the BEST, and aspire to live the ‘Vi–Life’, it is only fitting that  our producers be recognized in a way that echoes their commitment to excellence: The ViSalus Bimmer Club! By reaching the level of Regional Director or higher, ViSalus Distributors qualify to join the prestigious Bimmer Club and become eligible for a monthly BMW Bonus that goes toward a ViSalus–branded black BMW."" Take a minute and notice the language here: ""the BEST"", the ""aspire to live the 'Vi-Life'"", ""the prestigious Bimmer Club."" How could you not want to be a part of that, right? So why should you refuse the BMW? The fine print shows that they'll give you the $600/mo. only if you maintain the level of sales in your downline. If you understand the churn process you know that somewhere between 60% and 90% of your downline will drop out each year. Thus maintaining the level for the BMW is difficult. That itself wouldn't be a problem, except for one little thing, The BMW is in your name. If sales drop, you need to come up with the payments on the car. This can be especially difficult because, well, your sales have dropped so you are earning less. Distributors are finding that their credit gets ruined because the BMW got them saddled with an expense that they couldn't afford. The alternative to the BMW is to take a $300/mo. bonus in cash. It isn't the flashy BMW, but you avoid the strings attached. It reminds me of the mortgage lenders in 2004 and 2005 offering people adjustable rate loans to give them low initial payments. Many people found that this allowed them to afford their dream house (i.e. ""the BEST"", the ""prestigious house""), but when the rates re-adjusted they had big financial problems. The people who were smart didn't get seduced by the dream and made the wise financial decision with minimal risk. If ViSalus was a reputable company looking to do the right thing for its distributors, they'd offer them the option to assume the lease if their sales don't qualify. They don't do that. Instead the plan seems to saddle distributors with an expensive BMW so that they have extra motivation to make sure that their sales don't drop. Finally, you don't have to drive around in a big advertisement. ",™

Go to:  Abstract  Background  Many studies have reported beneficial effects from the application of near-infrared (NIR) light photobiomodulation (PBM) to the body, and one group has reported beneficial effects applying it to the brain in stroke patients. We have reported that the measurement of a patient's left and right hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) may clarify data and guide lateralized treatments. We sought to test whether a NIR treatment could 1. improve the psychological status of patients, 2. show a relationship between immediate psychological improvements when HEV was taken into account, and 3. show an increase in frontal pole regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and 4. be applied without side effects.  Methods  We gave 10 patients, (5 M/5 F) with major depression, including 9 with anxiety, 7 with a past history of substance abuse (6 with an opiate abuse and 1 with an alcohol abuse history), and 3 with post traumatic stress disorder, a baseline standard diagnostic interview, a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and a Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). We then gave four 4-minute treatments in a random order: NIR to left forehead at F3, to right forehead at F4, and placebo treatments (light off) at the same sites. Immediately following each treatment we repeated the PANAS, and at 2-weeks and at 4-weeks post treatment we repeated all 3 rating scales. During all treatments we recorded total hemoglobin (cHb), as a measure of rCBF with a commercial NIR spectroscopy device over the left and the right frontal poles of the brain.  Results  At 2-weeks post treatment 6 of 10 patients had a remission (a score ≤ 10) on the HAM-D and 7 of 10 achieved this on the HAM-A. Patients experienced highly significant reductions in both HAM-D and HAM-A scores following treatment, with the greatest reductions occurring at 2 weeks. Mean rCBF across hemispheres increased from 0.011 units in the off condition to 0.043 units in the on condition, for a difference of 0.032 (95% CI: -0.016, 0.080) units, though this result did not reach statistical significance. Immediately after treatment the PANAS improved to a significantly greater extent with NIR ""on"" relative to NIR ""off"" when a hemisphere with more positive HEV was treated than when one with more negative HEV was treated. We observed no side effects.  Conclusion  This small feasibility study suggests that NIR-PBM may have utility for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders and that double blind randomized placebo-controlled trials are indicated.

t5_2qhc8,morleydresden,1367561305,"700-800 is going price for Browning Hi-Powers.  Yes, you can get cheap 1911s for less, but you notice how you can't get actual Colt™ 1911s for less than 900-1000?  Same rule applies for Browning™ Hi-Powers.  Cheap Hi-Powers [are out there](http://www.e-sarcoinc.com/kareenisraelihi-powers.aspx).  The finish will not be as nice and I don't know how much tuning they'll require to run right.    Concealing a service pistol is possible, subject to some requirements.  First and foremost is an excellent belt, preferably worn high, up are your navel.  Nylon Instructor's belts like the ones made by Wilderness Tactical will get you more strength for less money, but would look kind of out of place with dress clothes.  And for a classy gun like a Hi-Power, almost want a well-made leather job, like one you'll get from the [Belt Man](http://www.thebeltman.net/).  Attached to that good belt, you want a good holster that will effectively control the gun.  I'm not too sure on holsters specific to Hi-Powers though.  Finally, incredibly tight clothes won't work.  Looser t-shirts can be fine, particularly if it's a heavier cloth that will drape somewhat.  ",™

t5_2qhc8,morleydresden,1367568042,"The Israeli models can probably be made reliable.  As can the Rock Islands.  The frames, slides, and barrels are probably not going to crack and explode on you.  Small parts may require tuning or replacing, either for reliability (extractors, feed ramps, magazine lips) or just performance (sights, trigger group).  Any more though, I've gone kind of sour towards ""cheap"" guns.  It might seem like a significant price difference now, but this is an item that can last through your children, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Amortized over generations, it's a pittance, and in a 100 years, a Colt™ will sell for more than a Rock Island.  There is the school of thought that carry guns should be cheap and easily replaceable since they are more prone to misadventure than safe queens, and the idea has some credence.      A belt is the foundation of your entire carry scheme.  It's the thing attaching the gun to you.  Loose, floppy belt = loose, floppy gun, and with a heavy gun, that's a killer for any kind of regular carry.  You might find a suitable belt off the rack, but I'd be surprised.  You're looking for at least 1.25"" wide (1.5"" is better) and with great vertical rigidity.  Grab the belt with both hands and try to fold it over lengthwise, it shouldn't move more than a few degrees.   Usually, you don't find this kind of sturdiness outside dedicated gun belts.  ",™

It was taken with a monorail view camera (5x6 film) and manually developed, after it was scanned and post produced. I took care of the entire process and working on film, it took me quite many tries to have the perfect shadow and exposure; I had to go back to the location several times to and always hope it was sunny enough, once I spent the whole day in front of that wall, just to check at which time of the day the shadow was looking more geometrical, eventually I decided on 2pm.

Rather, it's what Buddhism's stance on doctrine is: does Buddhism say that you must authoritatively accept historic Buddhist teachings, or does it allow for room for deviation?  My understanding is that it is [quite explicitly in the latter camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalama_Sutta).   Buddhism is a pragmatic affair; it's not the One Moral Way to Act™ but a proposed set of teachings and practices for overcoming dukha. A Buddhism that is unwilling to adapt to new knowledge about the world or different cultures is a Buddhism that won't be able to help people overcome dukha outside of a very particular time and place. The religion's efficacy has often come down to its adaptability, and the kinds of western, ""scientific"" Buddhism that are so attractive to many people today are a great example of that.",™
t5_2qhbp,Logical1ty,1367592441,"I think this is a lashing in Malaysia.  According to videos, such as this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6QKgXq1hng  It looks like Malaysians contravene Islamic standards of lashings by going for a lower number of more powerful strikes.   The following is more in line with traditional Shari'ah rulings regarding lashings:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDz4DyvKn3M  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp2OZy67T58  You're supposed to be able take a few dozen without breaking the skin, so they should look something like the second two videos above. I've never heard of a justification for 3 or 4 hard strikes with what they use in the Malaysian video.  Lashings can be used as penalties for fornication, lewdness, false testimony or slander, illegal dealing/use of alcohol, drugs, etc.  It's supposed to be more or less a humiliating ceremony. The first of the second two links is in Medina, Saudi-Arabia. The humiliation is the deterrent, the lashings themselves aren't going to be enough to deter anyone unless someone transgresses the limits and turns them into caning of the kind known from Western historical tradition where huge welts are left and flesh is even torn off (expressly forbidden in traditional Shari'ah). If I'm an alcoholic, none of those videos above would deter me from alcohol, take the lashing then go and get drunk again. At some point when the lashings aren't deterring someone (like a public drunkard who can't be humiliated) they'd get locked up instead.  I found one of those links on Reddit, the reactions are here:  http://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n7qnf/a_man_convicted_of_raping_his_daughter_has_been/c370xhx  People were disappointed and even amused by it. Someone linked another Malaysian lashing where they leave marks on a man's bare bottom (obviously this is completely against Shari'ah).  &gt; That sounds like fapping, more than lashing. Where is the crack of the whip?? The tattered clothing?? The bloodshed?!?!

Not about weed, in fact, I had a hard time even finding the word cannabis in it.   2nd one: The link is a study by CSAM, for those who don't know, that stands for California Society of Addiction medicine. It is a group of specialty physicians dedicated to curing substance abuse. Of course they are going to have negative things to say, however they actually recommend medical cannabis on several occasions. However their primary focus is on prescription drug/opioid dependence, the following info is on their main page, and surprisingly, there is nothing about marijuana on there. You have to specifically search for it... This is on their home page  Opioid Dependence  Advocates for evidence-based treatment of opioid dependence including in rural areas and in the criminal justice system  Trains physicians in Narcotic Treatment Programs and publishes a guideline for physicians in these programs  Trains physicians in the use of buprenorphine in office-based practice Works to prevent diversion of prescription medications while opposing ineffective regulations  Third one: this is a news article done by a local news station in Colorado essentially comparing the pros and cons of cannabis use that is very opinionated and inconsistent, and interviewing people along the way. However, a majority of the article advocates for legalization. The rest of the article is spent making ridiculous claims and quotes from a variety of ""doctors."" For my fellow smokers that love weed, here's a quote that sums up the atrocity of this article ""The more often teens use and the greater the dose, the more reckless their behavior becomes. So regular marijuana use puts them at greater risk for dropping out of school, engaging in risky sex behaviors and getting in accidents, the leading cause of death for adolescents.""

You can not easily sneak behind a deaf person by walking uncarefully and closing the doors carelessly.   In a world of silence, vibration is sound©  Snakes are deaf but very sensible to vibrations, that's how they hear the sounds that matter for them.  ",©

t5_2qhbe,SpotTheNovelty,1367601055,"It's called a reference transaction.  It's a Really Bad Idea™ to store credit card numbers, so to reduce a company's liability, they'll run a payment server.  What a payment server will do is call up the processor and say, ""Hey, I want to charge account XXXXXXX $YY.YY every month.""  The processor says, ""Okay, whenever you tell me {reference number} I'll know to run that transaction.""  This is how recurring monthly-payment stuff works (assuming the company isn't violating PCI rules, etc.)  This also has the benefit of keeping the company insulated from lost cards.  The payment server *cannot* charge anyone else *but* the authorized person, so stealing those reference numbers doesn't help you unless you really wanted to give some other business a bunch of money in small increments.  So, while you cannot pull the new card number, if you sign up for a recurring payment and a reference transaction is created, then the card number doesn't matter anymore.  I can envision a scam where you enter your card number and they make a reference transaction to pull lots of small charges off your card to hopefully not be detected, etc.",™

He labored day and night pruning and shaping each plant to an elegant state of perfection, and every passer-by would comment on the beauty of his work.    One day ▪M▪antis announced that visitors of great esteem were expected. Upon hearing this the pupil set to work, feverishly plucking weeds, trimming shrubs, and manicuring the moss, taking extra care to make sure the garden was in finest form, and as he worked, ▪M▪antis watched him from outside the garden wall.  When he finished he stood back to regard the fine work he had done, and called out to ▪M▪antis, ""isn't it beautiful?""  ""Yes,"" said ▪M▪antis, ""but it's missing one thing.  Help me over this wall and I'll set it right.""  The pupil hesitated for a moment, but then obeyed, lifting ▪M▪antis over the wall and setting him down in the garden.  ▪M▪antis slowly walked to the tree at the garden's center, and then violently shook its trunk, causing leaves to rain down all over the garden.

Meanwhile, posts that have a high level of compatibility with one's world view are automatically accepted as genuine and factual, regardless of the source.  I find this often. People who post links to ""/r/hailcorporate"" as comments in submissions that mention commercial products by name or have images of commercial products tend to, with near 100% certainty, mention commercial products in their own posts with no realization that they are equally valid ""/r/hailcorporate"" targets.  It's actually a hobby of mine to point this out to ""/r/hailcorporate"" posters. They are so convinced that there is a grand conspiracy to promote things on ""their"" subreddit and that dark nefarious posters are propagandizing on Reddit, while at the same time they are arguing that their Brandone Ultrafone is better than the Electrocorp Maxphone, or that the video game Shootemup #8153 is more hyperreal and balanced than Shootemup #4420.  Similarly, there is a class of individual who views any posting that shows the: military, government, business, science, anti-science, religion, certain authors, musicians, movies, etc... in a positive light is propaganda.......  ......while their own anti-(x) views are sacrosanct, pure, and earnest.

Do you even know what this program does? It's not a fucking conspiracy or a brainwashing attempt to get kids to buy guns. Nobody fucking cares if you don't want to own a gun. All the program does is tell kids not to touch guns and to tell an adult.  &gt;Created by past NRA President Marion P. Hammer, in consultation with child psychologists, elementary schoolteachers, and law enforcement officers, the program gives children a simple, effective action to take should they encounter a firearm in an unsupervised situation: ""If you see a gun, STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.""  &gt;Over the years, the program has been praised by numerous groups and elected officials, including the National Safety Council, the U.S. Department of Justice, and 24 state governors. When the program was formally endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Association in 2002, Sheriff John Cary Bittick, president of the group at the time, said, ""We are proud to partner with the National Rifle Association on this very important issue, and we would like to express our full support for this program. The safety of our nation's children is of paramount concern and I can think of no better way to provide them with knowledge about firearm safety than through the Eddie Eagle GunSafe® Program. This program, which has proven to be most effective, simply teaches children not to touch firearms and to tell adults immediately if they should come into contact with a firearm of any kind.""

t5_2t1w0,cavortingwebeasties,1367617073,"&gt;Spring is here, and with it lots of cleaning.  The MWO team spent the latter part of April focused on fixing bugs, balancing weapons, and enhancing existing features.  The fruits of our labors will begin to show up in both May patches.  During the month of May we plan to reveal more details about Community Warfare and UI 2.0, and giving you some first looks at some upcoming content.    &gt;**New Content:**   &gt;    *   `Mech of the Month – Blackjack (21st)   *     Hero `Mech of the Month – Misery (7th)   *     Champion `Mech of the Month – Jenner JR7-D© (7th)   *     New Patterns – Buccaneer (7th) and Cobra (21st)   *     New Cockpit Items – BattleMech Statues (7th)   *     New Modules – Seismic Sensor, UAV, Advanced UAV. Improved UAV, and UAV Upgrade (21st)   *     New Map - Canyon Network (21st)      &gt;**Canyon Network**    &gt;Canyon Networks is the latest map to enter the MechWarrior Online universe.  Deep ravines and long sheltered paths are ideal for speedy scouts, but beware - there could be an ambush waiting around every blind corner.  The high crags in the center of the map (conquest point Theta) form a highly defensible natural fortress.  Long sightlines and ample hiding spots make the canyon tops a sniper's playground - use caution if you stray up top, and be ready to dive for cover.    &gt;**UAV Consumable**      &gt;Players can now equip and launch a new battlefield consumable – the UAV drone.  This automated unmanned vehicle will launch 150m into the air, and keep station for up to 60 seconds before self-destructing.  The UAV can burn through ECM, providing targets for allied team members.  UAVs are vulnerable to weapon fire.    &gt;**Seismic Sensor Module**      &gt;On May 21st, players will be able unlock and equip a new tactical module – the Seismic Sensor.  This sensor is capable of detecting enemy BattleMech movement within 200 meters of your current location.    &gt;**Hero `Mech Colors**      &gt;Players can now customize up to 3 colors on their Hero `Mech colors in Camo Spec!  We look forward to seeing some of your new pain schemes on the battlefield.    &gt;**Bug Fixes**       &gt;With an extra week between patches, the MechWarrior Online team took time out of their production schedule to focus on some much needed hardening.  Some long standing HUD related bugs and crashes, and black screen bugs have been addressed and will go live in both the May 7th and May 21st patches.  Stay tuned for more detailed information with each release’s patch notes.    &gt;**Fixes and Improvement Highlights**   &gt;   *     Fixed friends list size limitation.   *     Better incoming message notification.   *     Improved message context sensitivity.   *     Chat Colour coding/User identification.   *     Decoupled Anti-Aliasing from System Spec option.   *     Implemented brightness/Gama option.   *     Fixed an issue where users were being disconnected during game.   *     Fix for possible soft lock users experienced while playing a match.   *     Fixed a crash that some users experienced when the end of round screen timer ran out and they were kicked back to the Mech Lab.   *     Fix multiple control rebind issues.   *     Fix for 'Mechs losing the ~1km/h with speed tweak.    *     Fixed a black screen bug that could happen to users after the loading screen.   *     And much more!

Mine has an added circuit built around a tlc555cp ic that turns one click from the foot pedal lag switch into a 1.75 second lag. A double click produces 4.5 seconds of lag. This only really works on xbox. And the advantage is; the host induces lag, his opponents freeze, and the host is free to kill them at his leisure without the risk of being shot. if you are playing a racing  game, just as someone else is about to finish, you lag them and they stop dead. You finish first. It is a tool for dirty rotten cheaters. I personally use mine to get out of maps on black oos zombies. As for a modded controller, they exist.

Along the lines of the matrix, check out Ray Kurzweil's ""Transcendent Man""...he may seem a bit crazy but the documentary was well worth the watch. In short, he prophecizes that we will become one interconnected organism, computer/human species hybrid...instantly aware of all things. This would be the end of mankind and the beggining of a single intelligence...easy to scoff at until he mentions that he has accurately predicted several trends in technology that came true.   I almost prefer a computer takeover of our minds matrix style to the insanity known as modern culture, and the course it is on. I would gladly ""suicide"" my independent mind to become the greater ""one consciousness"". Indubitably this would cause a ridiculous amount of uproar, and I just love how controversial and intriguing it truly is.   [EDIT]: Just realized you asked who would implement, rather than who would manufacture and produce the software. As for implementation, I see that as just as grey an area as how we move from capitalism to an automated, resource based economy. Truth be told, it still hurts my head to try to figure out how to achieve a truly free society and still reach (or more importantly, implement) what is best for the collective. We are at the absurd point where the raw resources are more abundant than the means of implementation (we can't afford what we have the technology and resources to produce, and we can't afford to permanently fix cyclic problems that produce profit and make capitalism function). Yet, this drive to produce profit regardless of the means is all we understand as a way of life...bridging the gap between that drive and a very different collective drive that ensures quality over quantity--well, I just can't figure that out...not without going the dictator route. Difficult, puzzling, downright impossible. I fear that freedom and the preservation of our species are not actually compatible...but hey, Im not a fascist I promise ♥",♥

t5_2qh24,FredFnord,1367646342,"God. Well, yeah, I can certainly see how that could cause such a thing. [Here](http://www.septa.org/sustain/blog/2011/07-06.html) is a better article about it, by the way.  Basically, what they're doing is putting little generators in the brakes (c.f. regenerative braking from electric and hybrid cars). And then they're feeding that power out through the same power lines that they normally draw on, and storing it in batteries so it can be used by the next train. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that it's actually a fairly substantial amount of power.  The problem is, how do you move that power over cables that were designed to carry a constant voltage, with other trains possibly on the same cables at the same time? If you just did it naively and pumped power into the system, you could end up running the wires at 700 or 800 volts. Bad Things Would Happen™. So my suspicion is that they're doing something cute, with some kind of strange AC-and-DC-on-the-same-wire thing, along with some kind of rectifiers on the battery end and some capacitors on the train collector end to strain out the AC signal. (Gah, I HALF remember all this stuff!)  I don't understand electronics well enough to understand how that would work, but I can certainly see how it could cause some pretty ridiculous interference. This was probably not as well-thought-out as it should have been. It's too bad, I have a soft spot in my ~~head~~ heart for SEPTA.",™

t5_2r9po,Kalulosu,1367659953,"First of all, if that's broken English, I don't know what's broken ;)  Second, you make pretty legit points. Of course, one can always invoke the voice acting (let's say it, Trahearne's voice is reaaaaaally not up to par with the others, it's lacking and emotion mainly, compared to, for example, Sieran...). But I felt more or less the same as you (Human Noble represent!).  However, it's become a very commonplace thing to expect the game to make you The Ultimate Savior of Everything ©. And while I can enjoy that (think Elder Scrolls, for example), I can totally get behind a game where I'm **one of the heroes**, not **the hero**, where being the main character doesn't imply having all the attention.  What I found clunky in all these bits of personal story was the ""commander"" status. What Trahearne asks us to do looks more lire commando jobs than second-in-command jobs. Had we been leader of the Pact's elite task force, that would've made a lot more sense, but I guess those who can't take being Trahearne's subordinate would have hated it even more to not be called ""Commander""...",©

t5_2qi0a,2DArray,1367684952,"**Not the Robots**  *A procedurally generated stealth game*  I haven't posted in a few weeks because I've been working on the Top Secret™ release-version-only parts of the project that I won't be talking about yet.  I've got some pretty pictures, though!  Here's a [radial flame effect gif](http://i.imgur.com/KZAtazY.gif).  I'm really happy with how it looks and it's super compatible/performant since it doesn't use any fancy shaders.  (Normally, it's not looping - those silly-looking stationary spikes around the outside aren't noticeable in context.)  I've also been doing some lighting tweaks lately - most notably, changing some stuff around so that the game would support Unity's deferred lighting setting.  (Deferred lighting is awesome, by the way.)  Here's two shots of average levels in the current build:  [A room with a new Spotlight renderer](http://i.imgur.com/xURy8P2.jpg)  I recently hooked up soft particles, so the Spotlight gets to benefit from this as well (which is fantastic because the Spotlight's deal is that he clips through everything, all the time).  [Lasers and bombs and lights everywhere](http://i.imgur.com/UgPC5vi.jpg)  You can see the new Sequence objective in that second image - this replaces the Key, if you played one of the alpha builds.  The Key was a mechanic that was leftover from an early version of the game's rules - enough had changed about the way the game played that it didn't feel like a compelling addition anymore.  The Sequence is similar, but I believe it's more effective.  We're getting close now!",™

t5_2ssp3,khosikulu,1367696706,"It depends on what the paper is for.  I've done some papers that size in one or two days; others, I've agonized for two or three months over.  The former were papers for seminars or other kinds of demonstrative tasks.  The latter tend to be for submission to journals.  Some of my colleagues take a year to write an article of 10,000-12,000 words, and they expect this to be the norm.  The problem of not knowing when to stop researching and start writing (and the fear that you missed something you'll be called out on) is a sign that you are aware of just how far the tendrils of your topic reach.  Ultimately you have to do it ""well enough,"" run it past some trusted semi-specialists or non-specialists for feedback, and then revise (if it's for a publication).  Editors will also tell you what to fix--when I was editing journals and books for presses, the amount of modification we had to do ourselves was stunning.  There are some people with Very Big Names™ in their fields who tender some real crap to journals.  I ended up doing a lot of independent library research to aid such an author, without so much as a byline because, hey, I'm editorial.  So if you tender work that is careful, reasonably deep, and cited/written well, editors will love you.  Don't underestimate the value of that.",™

One could say that our goal is to implement [Erich von Hippel's](http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/) vision, to make every user into a ""lead user"". The expression ""lead user"" is his denotation of users who actually design new products based upon their needs or desires. I had a chat with Erich von Hippel during the summer 2011 when he  visited Sweden, and his impression then, was that we were the only ones in the world actually focusing on explicit inputs from ""users"".  There are several companies that have used, or merely abused... this idea, like Procter &amp; Gamble earlier, but when I say *abused* it's because they have used the ""users"" to make new products which they have then patented... Our goal is to make every new product a copy-left design. I made a draft of something I denote [Generic Pitchfork License](http://wish-it.se/genericpitchforklicence) earlier (name inspired from a reddit chat), which would be a generalisation of [Generic Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) to all kinds of products.[1]  That is, we are not focused on software per se, but from my point of view, the free software development actually lacks this input from ""lead users"".

t5_mouw,saijanai,1367711408,"&gt;Actually according to meditation researchers TM also leads to some minor gamma improvement (it's hard to really know, as TM data is often self-produced and of very poor quality), in the now established progression of consciousness expansion and integration which starts with slow alpha effect (""mindfulness of the body"", TM, and many other relaxation-response style beginner practices) to high amplitude gamma coherence seen in meditative masters in both the Hindu and Buddhist milieus.  Don't know what you mean by ""gamma improvement.""  Long-term TMers trend towards lower gamma EEG power while trending towards higher alpha EEG power both during and outside of meditation.  And ""masters"" of both the Hindu and Buddhist millieus are practicing focused attention meditation, and   research on the effects of various non-TM techniques was compared to the equivalent TM research, by the American Heart Association and they reported that TM consistently had an effect on lower BP, which suggests that the practice of these gamma-heightening effects by the ""masters"" isn't as good for you as you would like to think, being a former-TMer, turned *My Evil Twin™*, as you are.

t5_2qm4e,SNOO_KI,1367712694,"Yes, as /u/seany said, the high-velocity air ""pulling"" on the airway walls was an analogy that I used to hopefully help your understanding. The airways are actually collapsing due to the pressure outside the airways being higher than the pressure within the airways at that precise point along the airway during forced expiration.    * Keep in mind, whenever I use the word ""collapse"", I do **not** mean that the airway is closing off completely!  Also, you're absolutely right. Flow≠Velocity (A lot of medical students have trouble with understanding that for some reason). The increased airway diameter decreases resistance (by a factor of 4, yes ☺) which brings the point of airway collapse (a.k.a. Equal Pressure Point) up closer to the mouth, thus preventing early airways collapse and air trapping.

t5_2qh1a,ropers,1367735550,"I don't want to elaborate too much, both because I don't remember all the dirty details from when I lost faith in Bugzilla and because I don't find this a pleasant topic that I'd like to spend a lot of time on, but I'll say this:  Power-tripping for humans is to some extent an emergent trait, you just create the environment, and human nature takes care of the rest, and boom! the world's a poorer place for it. It's also seen in Wikipedia and in a lot of bureaucracies – pretty much all of which also have in common with Bugzilla that they were started with the best of intentions.   So what is it in the created environment that sometimes brings out the worse side or the worst in people? It's a combination of things. One is red tape. In Bugzilla, that means mandatory hoops to jump through and boxes to tick, etc. Sure, we want bug reports to be as useful as possible, and *to the person sifting through* the –[Sturgeon's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law)-affected– deluge of incoming bug reports, all that missing information can seem like a terrible disease. If only we could cure that. Hey, I have an idea! We'll just make this field mandatory! And that step mandatory! And this! And that! We'll get all the information we need out of people! NOT. In the words of H. L. Mencken: ""There is always a well-known solution to every human problem — neat, plausible, and wrong."" The person sifting through has their perception distorted by a very misleading filter: The people who fail to submit *That Perfect Bug Report To End All Bug Reports™* because *Ain't Nobody Got Time For That* or who fail for some other reason, because they maybe don't fit Bugzilla's hard enforced template, the people who have found a problem and are giving up on telling the people who can fix that problem, those people [are not seen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRgQX82O4). So every change of the Bugzilla system to become slightly more ~~fascist and obnoxious~~ submitter-hostile is not perceived as a problem by the people who just look at the incoming bug reports. They just perceive themselves as beleaguered [gong farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_farmer), and look! There seems to be less shit now. But it's the wrong metric and perspective. The right question is: Are we receiving all the *possible* helpful contributions, and are we using them in the best possible way?   Then there's a false focus on numbers. X number of bug reports, and our volunteer or employee Y closed N of them. So the more bug reports Y ""closes"" –often by any means necessary– the more status, karma, fictional Internet points, peer admiration, maybe even respect in the workplace. But it doesn't matter how many reports are open. Storage is cheap. It does matter when reports of unresolved issues are closed/discarded on some technicality. The incoming information needs to be assessed qualitatively, not quantitatively.  (I may be confusing or blending my experiences with launchpad and Bugzilla somewhat; I'm not sure.)  I could probably go on, but you get the idea (and I really don't wanna go on).  PS: Suffice it to say that if your project uses Bugzilla, I probably won't submit bugs to you using that system. I may shoot you an email to a relevant list or to a person that's pretty much the sole dev. Of course you may choose to discard that emailed information while giving me a condescending lecture because I didn't deal with the BugZilla red tape and That's Against The Rules™. But if you do that, then you probably would have done that in BugZilla too, after a lot of red tape and administrative politics. And you do that at your peril. Because it lies in the nature of bugs (especially interesting bugs) that they're the new, the unexpected, the *Stuff That Doesn't Fit Pre-existing Moulds For Which There Already Is A Prescribed Routine And Category*.",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1367745501,"  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)",™

t5_2s8kf,t_maia,1367774748,"&gt;I'm just wondering if the standard brands you find in stores (Warners, Maidenform, etc) are junk and I should look to order something online from Brastop or other such site.  You can hunt locally and you might find something.   The problem however is finding the right shape for your breasts. While 38D is widely available, the shape you need can be hard to find. If you already figured you have shallow breasts than you already know that you need special cuts suited to your shape - halfcups mostly.   Since you mention Target, I remember seeing a bra there that looks really promising cutwise for a shallow shape. It is the [Gilligan &amp; O'Malley® Women's Favorite Balconette Push Up Bra](http://www.target.com/p/gilligan-o-malley-women-s-favorite-balconette-push-up-bra-assorted-colors/-/A-14308156#prodSlot=large_1_21)  and it is available in 38D.   But IMO you'll get the best value for money through ordering online. 38D is a size where lots of the bras suitable for a shallow shape are often available in a sale for a really low price. Considering that lots of those are branded bras of good quality, you can get really good deals.   The downside will be the hassle of returning them if they don't fit. If you cannot afford bras at Target at the moment, you probably will be better off not spending any money on shipping.   ",®

t5_2qh1i,soulsteelgray,1367780919,"I was labeled/identified as gifted as far back as Kindergarten (I remember being taken out of class once to play a board game--one of those educational-type board games, of course) but it didn't really kick into overdrive when I entered 4th grade and transitioned from STEPS (K-3) to PEAK (4-6). That's when I and fellow PEAK students would be taken out of classes for about an hour--I think it was daily, though it may have been weekly, I don't quite remember--during the reading portion of classes to basically do advanced type stuff, like reading more advanced literature than what our non-PEAK classmates were reading. They also tried to play up our supposed different way of thinking. This continued even in high school when I was still in the gifted program (which became simply G/T in 7-12). One particularly memorable lesson in my junior year of high school was when we spent an entire class period depicting something through painting. The non-G/T IB students (I was in IB as well) groused about how we were painting and they were knee-deep in essays.  Now that I'm A Fully Functioning Adult™ and look back on that time period, I don't feel necessarily like the gifted program hindered me, but it did encourage ways of thinking that I may not have been compelled to explore otherwise. I probably would have received the same test scores if I wasn't in the gifted program, but it was nice to explore out-of-the-box thinking anyways. Hasn't helped me a ton out in the real world, but it's an experience I wouldn't trade for anything.  ",™

With only 6 active players, they are easily beaten in one on zero matchups, and are burned deep often.  **2. (2) Chicago Bears (1-15)**- (Awkward same spot) Cutler decides to read some good ol' fatpeoplestories, and realizes he is not getting the best of his 'beetus. Josh McCown leads the bears in passing with 1 Touchdown and 199 yards through 16 games, as Forte is handed the ball nearly 1000 times. Defenses stack the box as he averages a measly .014 yards per carry. Adam Podlesh strips a ball carrier for a safety in their 2-0 win over the Packers.   **3. Miami Dolphins (3-13)**- The Phins decide to go old school (or at least 08) fishies, and drag out the Wildcat. Tannehill is their leading receiver, passer, and rusher, playing a part in 100% of their offensive production. Despite this, they total 600 offensive yards, and win 3 games entirely because their defense records 6 interception return TDs on the season   **4. (4)Minnesota Vikings (4-12)**- Somehow they end up in their number spot (CONSPIRACY!). Christian Ponder has severe regression as his handoff accuracy decreases, causing a record 638 team fumbles. madden 25 has to actually release an update allowing negative accuracy ratings. They actually finish 5-11, but after cutting Chris Kluwe during the preseason, Goodell fines them one win for trying to silence Reddit's favorite punter.  **5. (14)  Seattle Seahawks (4-12)**- The Russell Wilson Show™ comes to an end quickly as he loses his God status, and quickly falls into “Sanchise” status. After an event similar to buttfumble (Dubbed the “Nutfumble”), and a solid 0-8 start cause by Wilson’s statline of 0TDs-34ints (barely better than Sanchez), Russell Wilson is Benched and booed, as Pete Carroll Decides to play the defense all 60 mins. At this point, nearly half the Seahawks fan base has died, but fortunes turn up as they end the season on a solid 4-4 second half record.  **6. (9) New York Giants**  **7.

(22) Indianapolis Colts**  **26. (21) Houston Texans**  **27. (10) Dallas Cowboys**  **28. (5) Atlanta Falcons (10-6)**- The Falcons have a pretty Regular season, with the expected end. They play exactly as you’d expect in the playoffs, giving up a 17 point comeback in the final 112 seconds of play.  **29. (20) Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6)**- Too old, too slow, they said. The Steelers proved everyone wrong throughout the regular season, playing at their highest level. Roethlisberger plays through a fractured spine, and Polamalu continues to hair. By the post season however, injuries catch up to Big Ben, as the defense goes [home]( http://www.providencepoint.org/) causing a playoff collapse.   **30. (8) Carolina Panthers (12-4)**- Cam Newton grows to a whopping 6’8” 450lbs, as he continuously denies and kind of steroid use. He is able to QB sneak madden 12 style into the endzone, as he has a record 48 rushing touchdowns. The Panthers are slammed in the playoffs as Cam looks into male enhancement and goes to a plastic surgeon to fix the various skin issues caused by his “not-steroids”.  **31. (28) New York Jets (8-8)**- Did you really think the Jets could get a winning record?^^^FucktheJets,amirite?  Unfortunately, despite getting into the Super Bowl, the mutated monster known as Daveno McSanchimmsroy slowly falls apart as it was not fed in well over a month. No one knows where the food was going, but the number of Monster food containers in Rex Ryan’s garbage can was a bit suspicious.   **32. (3) Detriot Lions (15-1)**- Yay! The Lions finally champions of something! Megatron gets another monster year, as the lions defense finally gets off the bench for the opposing team’s possession. Jason Hanson decides to come out of retirement in the last 5 minutes of the Super Bowl, with the Lions up 56-2. Using the new skills he acquired in the computer class he took during his retirement, he placed his name on the Lions official roster in time to earn himself a ring. ",™

t5_mouw,saijanai,1367790796,"Yes, the defective TM appears to be good for hypertension, at least according to the AHA, and preliminary research on PTSD indicates that symptoms of PTSD drop by 50 percent after 1-3 months of practice of TM.  You had better tell the VA and the Department of Defense that simple napping has this huge effect on PTSD and that they don't need to do any more research on how to treat it: just tell PTSD patients to ""go take a nap.""

t5_2rh4c,Snackhat,1367791592,"Ok so reviewing awful movies is kind of my thing so lemme take a shot at this:  1. So first Khaled quoted himself, pulling some Yeezus shit or something. Quote consisted of all of the dialogue of the movie, so I give that a 0/5 for the spoilers.  2. Khaled grabs Ace Hoodsie and meets up with Future's Haitian friend or something, and then **takes Ace away to go talk after going up to Haitian guy**. Bold move on Khaled's part, I give that a 0/5 for sense but 5/5 for balls-to-the-walls attitude.  3. Holy fuck Ace you are depressed cause people won't shut up about **KHALED'S NEW SHIT**? 1/5 for manliness.  4. Camera is fucking everywhere, but considering they came with Haitians, I give the camera man 5/5 for controlling it during an earthquake.  5. Music is 0/5 for illegally stealing Beethoven samples.  6. Handshakes are around 2/5, hugs get a 5/5, cause when you got no new friends, you gotta make sure you got new hugs &lt;333333  7. Mr. Hatin' Haitian is also pretty god damn depressed over people wanting Khaled's music, so I have led myself to believe that the plot twist that was cut is Khaled is the villain and is using his music to make every rapper kill themselves out of depression, and the No New Friends™ policy is so they don't talk to anyone that can help, and this is all an elaborate scheme for Khaled to get da $$$, so this is a 10/5 for plot twist.  8. WALKING IS SO FUCKING AWESOME I NEED MORE WALKING THANK GOD OR ELSE I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE THE FUCK WE WERE LIKE RED CARPET IT COULD BE LIKE WILLY WONKA'S FACTORY OR SOME SHIT 5/5 FOR WALKING HELP  9. Pink Jacket looks like a barbie who wants to cover it up, and is also falling under Khaled's evil scheme of mo dough no bro, so he gets a 2/5 for a predictable character. Also shoulda had Tom Hanks play that role, the lines beckon him.  10. OK ANOTHER PLOT TWIST: **THE CAR IS THE VILLAIN HOLY SHIT KHALED IS RAP GAME EDGAR ALLEN POE!!!!!** I never thought about the cars until now, they just stare blankly into you, so many of them, ^endlessly ^looking, ^^just ^^watching, ^^^forever ^^^^5/5  11. Ok Khaled, real talk what the fuck you just said no new friends AND no paparazzi literally a second ago, and looks who's all buddy buddy with Perez Hilton now. 0/5 for false advertising, but 5/5 for the fact that I don't think that guy legitimately knew he was in a movie.  12. Captions are so helpful, because sometimes when I watch Pulp Fiction I wanna listen to Khaled's new single (STILL ASKING ACE) but I can't, so when he put captions in it let me multitask, which I love as a single mother of 19. 4/5 for helpfulness, rap game Billy Mays.  Review: This is hip-hop's *The Room*, in that I laughed my ass off the entire time to probably some of the worst video I have ever seen, and I enjoyed it, but it was as scary as Danny Brown getting new front teeth. Totaled the score comes out to a...  **49/75**  TL;DR: Rap Game Tommy Wiseau",™

Shoulda quoted the artist.  &gt;Got another commission piece finished up today, so I thought I’d share it with all you fine ponefolks.  &gt;I was about to skip over giving this piece a tl;dr description, but I think this one needs at least a partial backstory to be fully understood.  &gt;Since Twily got her alicorn god powers, she’s been playing around with them a bit to see what kind of new forms of magic she can pull off. After swapping RD and Rarity’s races, she finds a spell that advertises it’s amazing ability to ‘cool ponies off’. It’s a hot day, so Twilight casts the simple spell without a second thought. Moments later, she’s Super-Naked™. Here, she’s just now realizing what she’s gone and done to herself.  &gt;Loved doing up all the expressions on this one. It was also a lot of fun designing Super-Naked™ Twily (which is slightly different from Anatomically Correct Sexy Naked™ Twily, but let’s not get sidetracked).

t5_2vox2,lokochileno,1367799381,"The Spring Festival of LXs, better known as Spring Fest, has become the premier annual celebration of LX-platform vehicles for SRT® and Chrysler brands. With owners from across the world gathering in Irvine, California, the event presents the perfect canvas for SRT to introduce special editions of vehicles. This year was no exception as SRT debuted a special-edition Charger 392 appearance package during the eighth annual edition of the event.  Mark Trostle, Head of SRT Design, was at Spring Fest to reveal the Charger 392, which was shown in TorRed with black accents on the hood and roof and sporting the iconic ‘392’ badge on the front fender. The 392 fender badge is gloss black with a gray insert within the 392. The interior of the Challenger 392 introduced at Spring Fest features a serialized dash plaque on the instrument panel.  “It’s a cool package,” said Trostle. “When you think of old school muscle cars, you think of black accents and this car kind of handles that in a new way. Not the whole hood is black, just a portion of it and we’ve done it in gloss black versus a matte black. It definitely has a presence to it.”  The Charger 392 that was unveiled at Spring Fest rolls on black Vapor Chrome wheels, which are a signature to the SRT brand with the Chrysler Group family of vehicles. Also, adding to the “tough” look of the car is the fact that the hood bulges are painted in black, giving the hood a two-tone look and finish. The roof and rear spoiler are also black, as are the mirrors. A heavy accent-traced stripe with a decal starts at the front fascia and runs to the corner of the rear fascia and reads “SRT.”  “The stripe and decal complement the black on the upper side of the car really well and ties into the black on the wheels,” said Trostle. “It creates a really cool look. Plus, it has the badging of SRT on the side as well.”  To match the ‘392’ moniker on the 392 Charger, a limited run of 392 cars will be produced beginning later this model year. Available colors will be: Bright White, Billet Silver, Plum Crazy, HEMI® Orange and TorRed.  http://www.drivesrt.com/news/2013/03/srt-charger-392-appearance-package-debuts-at-spring-fest.html",®

COUNTA returns the number of cells in a range that contain data— that's assuming that you've got data all the way down, adding additional rows over time, and *don't* want to include data prior to B39.   If you're only trying to cover data for *x* most recent years, you might want to use OFFSET(INDIRECT(""B""&amp;COUNTA(B:B)-*x*)),0,0,*x*,1) instead. Or something similar; I'm not looking at your worksheet, but I hope you get the idea.  &gt;**TL;DR** ""OFFSET it… and forget it!™""",™

t5_2sokd,phantom784,1367813070,"Technically, ASCII is only a 7 bit encoding and only the numbers 0 to 127 correspond to a character. Since computers use 8 bits, the extra bit is simply filled with a 0. (i.e. 128 to 255 are invalid and don't correspond to anything)  As the need to encode more characters arose, many new character sets were created, most of which took advantage of that left-over bit, and defined the the characters from 128 to 255. Each of these defines the characters differently. Note that this isn't Unicode, this is a predecessor, and it still has a 255 character limit.  Then, as frenchtoaster mentioned, Unicode was created so that many many characters could all be encoded together. UTF-8 uses a clever way of remaining compatible with ASCII while getting around the 255 character limit. 0 - 127 are used just as in ASCII to remain compatible. However, when the byte is between 128 and 255, the computer knows that more than one byte is used to encode the character and it has to read ahead. For example, 88 is below 127, so it simply stands for the letter X. However, the ’ is encoded as 226, 128, 153.  If your computer doesn't know the text is UTF-8, and mistakenly uses a different character set, it'll simply show whatever those numbers represent in the set it is using. One of the most common non-Unicode encodings is the Windows-1252 encoding, and 226, 128, 153 in that encoding is â€™",™

t5_2wgat,yudkev,1367821424,"Stephen Hawking once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the centre of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy.   At the end of the lecture, a strange little man, dressed in what appeared to be tattered rags, stood up and said: ""What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really but a simple field mouse carried in the talons of a giant hawk, who flies in a circle around the sun.""   The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, ""How does the hawk *breathe* out there?""   ""You're very clever, young man, very clever,"" said the strange little man. He rose from his seat and began approaching the podium with a rather peculiar gait. ""But you seem to have forgotten that hawks have gizzards, and—""  *""Gizzards convert stardust into oxygen,""* they finished in unison. Stephen Hawking slapped his forehead as though to say, *duh doyy*.  ""I—yes. That's right."" The strange little man and Stephen Hawking looked at each other in silence.   The acclaimed astrophysicist smiled and turned back to the audience. ""Guess we all have our brain farts, huh folks? Well, if there are no further questions—""  ""Yo, is this going to be on the exam?"" a lazy voice rang out from the back.  ""You. Motherfucker,"" growled the renowned cosmologist, and gracefully dove off the stage. A shriek sounded as the legendary theoretician jumped over several rows at once, sending papers flying.   The strange little man stood watching from his stage. He did not leave as a duo of security personnel grabbed the respected author by his shoulders, restraining him as a nurse in an antiquated uniform, complete with one of those little hats, sheepishly pulled up a pant leg and injected a syringe full of Triflupromazine™ into his thigh. She blushed and puttered away. The security personnel briskly nodded at each other and carried away the limp, drooling Labour Party supporter.   And the strange little man still did not leave. He did not leave as the theater lights turned off row by row with a clicking sound. He did not leave as a frail, elderly janitor in a train conductor hat came onto the stage with a mop bucket, whistling. The janitor gasped and jumped back as he noticed the strange little man, his wings now fully extended, standing at the foot of the stage.   ""Sorry, Sonny. Didn't see ya there! You don't mind if I'm waxin' up the ol' surfboard up here, do ya? I won't be long now.""   Before the strange little man could say anything, the janitor dropped the mop and put his arms on his hips.   ""Say, what's eating you, friend? Got anything you'd like to share with Old Man Mopsy over here? He's one heck of a listener, you know!""   And before the strange little man could say anything to *that*, the janitor sat down on the bench, patted the seat next to him, and pulled out a cigar.   ""Moonbay Stunners. You can't get 'em anymore, not since that embargo."" The janitor slowly set down the box of matches he had been unsuccessfully trying to light the cigar with.   ""We lost some good men in that embargo. You ever lost a friend, friend?""  The strange little man looked up, which removed the shadows from his face, revealing a beak.   ""You don't make many friends when you're.. the Hawk King.""   The janitor gasped again and grabbed at his chest with both hands, wheezing and until he stiffened and crumbled to the floor, knocking his mop bucket over in the process. The Hawk King quickly looked around, then lifted the janitor's body into his talons and flew straight through the roof of the auditorium, screeching as rubble littered down from the rafters.   They say when the moon is full, and the night is quiet, you can look real close and see the silhouette of the hawk king, carrying the crumbled body of a wise, old janitor in his talons. What you are actually seeing is a medium sized lunar crater called Fra Mauro, located to the northeast of Mare Cognitum and southeast of Mare Insularum.   Some say it's haunted. ",™

t5_2qh13,complex_reduction,1367846209,"Aaand that is the end of that technology for average consumers worldwide thanks to a few American gun nut fuckwits.  &gt;Mr Wilson, who describes himself as a crypto-anarchist, said his plans to make the design available were ""about liberty"".   It's funny how the American perspective on liberty and freedom seems to constantly fuck things up for everybody else.  Most places worldwide don't think random people should have the right to shoot and kill whoever they feel like, and most citizens of those places agree.   It might shock US gun nuts to realise that most citizens of gun controlled countries do not feel ""oppressed"" or that any ""liberties"" have been stolen from us. Gun nuts act as though our non-American Governments are stomping on our freedom and preventing us from acquiring guns, when the truth is that most of us just don't have much of an inclination towards supporting accessible murder.   I have never once in my life heard somebody in my country say, ""Gee I really wish I could buy a gun to shoot people, but the Government is oppressing me!"". Funnily enough, whenever the topic of guns comes up, most of the time it's with a laugh at gun nut attitudes and their quasi-clinical paranoia.  Reddit users are primarily American, and I'm sure some people are going to be pissy about something I've said, but I fucking hate this attitude (some, very loud) Americans have that every other country is somehow getting freedom wrong, as if the USA has mastered democracy and is doing us all a favour by spreading Freedom^© worldwide.  Yeah, well, I would have liked to have had the freedom to buy and operate a 3D printer sometime in the future.

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1367860311,"&gt;Here were some of the specific things that I'm confused about, and I hope you can fill me in on:  [you've raised several immaterial points and I have ignored those -proceeding with the material issues...]  &gt;If there is a new agent in the corn that causes an effect in the animal, why are the researchers wrong to expect the effect to increase as the dose of the agent increases?  You misread the protocol -or I did- it is splendidly worded to obfuscate what is going on, IMHO, which, BTW, violates yet another standard from the 408 guidelines: clarity:   &gt;. None of these differences were considered test article related since they were of small magnitude and within ±2SD of the mean for the population of reference groups, and were either different from the control or the reference group but not both, or were not dose related (observed at the low dose but not at the high dose), and/or occurred after 4 weeks but not at study termination.  Let's look at that:   ""small magnitude"" is not defined anywhere.  ""±2 SD"" refers to differences between the experimental group and the mean of the reference group, not the control group. ""Small"" could mean ±4SD or ±400SD different from the experimental group, could it not? Otherwise, show me somewhere in the literature where ""small magnitude"" is explicitly defined (Jacob Cohen defines ""small effect size"" in the behavioral sciences as 0.2 SDs, but I don't think you want to go there. Using his terminology, ±2.0 SDs would be ""really, really, really, really, really large"" assuming 0.3SD separation between each category, as he does in his book on statistical power)  ""***and*** were either different from the control or the reference group but not both,"" means that if a difference of, say 400 (4 hundred) SDs is found between the experimental and control group (I consider that a ""small"" magnitude, don't you?) but is within 2 SDs of the average of the other commercial feeds, it is still counted as ""no significant difference"" and therefore not reported.    &gt;You call the statistical manipulations ""arcane."" What are the statistical standards for this field of study, and how do they differ from the ones used in this study?  The [OECD TG 408 protocol](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/consultationsclosed/call/110707.pdf) that Mosanto's study is modeled after only calls for reference groups in specific circumstances:  &gt;The inclusion of reference groups, fed with a diet containing commercially available food/feed similar to the test food/feed, in the experimental design, in order to estimate the natural variability of test parameters is in general not recommended, since this would substantially increase the number of test animals. Historical control data on natural variations in values of test parameters should primarily be obtained from databases available in the actual testing facility, while data from literature might also be informative. Inclusion of reference groups may be considered if no acceptable historical background data is available.  Since Mosanto had carefully chosen the original strain of corn, maize, soy, etc., for genetic modification, they must surely have had plenty of historical data available on its properties and effects on animals, so the use of reference groups can't be justified, and yet they used them, just the same, at least in both the bt maize, and Roundup Ready™ corn toxicity studies. There's no justification to more than double the number of lab animals used unless they were trying to hide something.  Edit: I am ***NOT*** claiming they were trying to hide toxic effects, merely the existence of *any* unexpected effects at all, since this would disrupt their marketing meme.",™
t5_2qlqk,Karunamon,1367860515,I'm glad to know you're one of those people who places THE LAW© above right and wrong.  Seriously. Scrupulously adhering to whatever set of laws does not make you a good person or inherently noble or any such thing. It makes you obedient. And i'd argue dulls your sense of right and wrong because you've outsourced it to a third party.,©

It's not like you picked up Joe Blow CPA off the street and asked him to help you with some legislation.  These people are generally very well educated, wealthy and ""elite"" types. Sometimes they work for organizations specifically designed to lobby. The symbiotic relationship between industry and government is undeniable. And the diffusion of individuals back and forth results in legislation that benefits industry over average individuals.  It's ok to have people familiar with industry provide input, it's not ok for industry to have such a huge say in what new laws ans regulations stipulate, often to their tremendous financial gain.   This is the exact same disingenuous rhetoric president Obama uses to disguise his underhanded techniques. He'll say ""uh this is a complicated issue and we're going to make incremental change, blah, blah, blah"" then he hires a former Goldman Sachs executive and tells Eric Holder not to prosecute HSBC in a cut-and-dry cases of illegal and unethical money laundering for violent drug cartels.

t5_2r0cn,Rick0r,1367874288,"I disagree that it's cheating, but if it's something you wouldn't tell your partner about because they wouldn't like it, then it's certainly a concern that needs to be addressed.   Put it this way, if he's acting like he's single, i.e. he's telling other girls what he'd do with them if he was there, etc etc, then he's exploring what it'd be like to be single.   It could purely be an innocent fantasy/fetish for him, i.e. porn + dirty talk, and the thought of actually doing these things in person with these girls is completely beyond his thought process - But it needs to be addressed. Now that you're aware of it, you'll need to get it off your chest, even if it's just to stop your brain from turning into ScumbagBrain™ and thinking that it's just your BF wanting to cheat on you.  Confront him and deal with it. He'll probably be embarrassed, but stick with it. Don't just shy away from it, and don't go all secret agent and message his reddit account from a throwaway, as tempting as it might be.  Hell, you could turn it into a positive if you're willing to embrace his fantasy a bit - i.e. He might like it if you sent him dirty photos to comment on, etc. Just putting it out there, anyway.

t5_2snuc,jez2718,1367875070,"Grimm's argument goes as follows:  Assume there is a set of all truths, call it T. Consider the set 2^T consisting of all subsets of T (i.e. all sets of true statements). By Cantor's diagonal argument there are strictly more things in 2^T than there are in T. However for every x in 2^T there is a unique truth, i.e. the truth that x is in 2^T . Thus there must be at least as many elements of T as there are elements of 2^T . But this contradicts the above conclusion of the diagonal argument. Thus by *reductio ad absurdum* there can be no such set T.

t5_2s3qj,gt7,1367884901,"US regulators eye Bitcoin supervision  By Tracy Alloway, Gregory Meyer and Stephen Foley in New York   ©Bloomberg Senior officials at a top US financial regulator are discussing whether Bitcoin, the controversial cyber-currency, might fall under their regulatory remit.  Bitcoin “is for sure something we need to explore”, Bart Chilton, one of the five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) told the Financial Times. A person familiar with the CFTC’s thinking said that the regulator is “seriously” examining the issue.  Said Mr Chilton: “It’s not monopoly money we’re talking about here – real people can have real risk in these instruments, and we need to ensure that we protect markets and consumers, even in what at first blush appear to be ‘out there’ transactions.”  Four-year-old Bitcoin is attracting the interest of regulators amid volatile booms and busts in the value of the cyber-currency and fresh media interest.Intensified regulatory scrutiny could pose challenges for proponents of Bitcoin, who have praised the currency for its independence from traditional authorities.  In March, a branch of the US Treasury department said that all firms that exchange or transfer the virtual currency will be considered “money services businesses”. That means they must provide information to the government and introduce policies to prevent money laundering. It could also make it risky for other financial institutions to do business with firms that are not in compliance.  Since the ruling, at least three companies in North America have reported having their business accounts closed by their banks. Bitfloor, a New York-based Bitcoin exchange, said it was shutting down entirely, and it has not yet been able to return funds to customers.  Roger Ver, founder of Bitcoinstore.com and an angel investor in Bitcoin start-ups, said that he knew of some entrepreneurs who had moved to Panama to explore setting up operations outside of the US.  “Even if US regulations make it hard for Bitcoin businesses to operate in the US, that doesn’t mean it will make it difficult for people to use Bitcoin as a currency in the US. Bitcoin is a world currency,” he said.  The CFTC regulates derivatives contracts and, under Dodd-Frank financial reform, has sweeping authority to oversee retail foreign exchange dealers.  CFTC jurisdiction generally does not extend to cash markets unless exchanges list derivatives contracts based on them. For example, the agency monitors physical oil transactions insofar as they influence crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  One person familiar with the discussions said Bitcoin would not become subject to CFTC jurisdiction unless it becomes the basis for a derivatives contract. The use of Bitcoin to pay for ordinary goods is outside the commission’s bailiwick.  Leveraged Bitcoin transactions that settled in more than two days – so-called “rolling spot” transactions – would also fall under CFTC jurisdiction, the person said.  Said Mr Chilton, the commissioner: “In essence, we’re talking about a type of shadow currency, and there is more than a colourable argument to be made that derivative products relating to Bitcoin falls squarely in our jurisdiction.” ",©

It will be a poignant and indescribably joyous event for those, who were patient, and are expecting Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and have accepted Him! It will be a very painful event for you, who are listening now, because you have rejected Jesus Christ. Yet it is not entirely too late for you, for it is written for you:  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, ""also on the cross, He went for you, in order to take your punishment upon Himself"", that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, the time is near! In North Korea 300,000 to 500,000 Christians get tortured. Obama adjusts the Arms Act, so that the prohibited weapons can be used in countries, where they do like to have these weapons! The antichrist likes to use children, in order to hide his true nature. Obama cares so much about people, that those camps are ready, with of American-made beheading machines, signed by the antichrist Obama! And these are already distributed by his order. So in North Korea many thousands are in Nazi-like FEMA punishment camps. These punishment camps are hidden, worldwide! The radical Islam is increasing rapidly, worldwide, and they persecute the Christians, as in Africa, Mali, Tanzania, Niger, Kenya, Uganda, America, North Korea, China... Worldwide one wants to exterminate the Christians!  Luke 21, verse 25 to 28 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.  Verily, let nothing prevent you from accepting Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, in your life! Now choose this day whom you want to serve. Get yourself ready to meet Him, because He'll come unexpectedly, and puts you to the test now!  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!  SHALOM!

There's nothing the government is going to do about demand for pot. The article talks about treatment facilities and so forth, it sounded like something for harder drugs.

Where others might be close to reality, the religious believer has some conviction *that they use will itself to uphold, and related information is accordingly bent/arranged by will, not by logic*. And whenever that core is touched, the whole person is threatened to be undone.  In a truthful mind, this can't happen. In the mind of a believer, the natural effects in the mind threaten to unwind this construct of falsehoods that the whole person has become, and it requires an effort of will to uphold this. This is also the reason that ""insulting"" TheProphet™ (Piss be upon him.), the person experiences an emotion of destruction, so the reaction is that of a cornered animal.

t5_2qq65,UpYourButtJobu,1367945541,"Hello again fellow Scotchiteers. Today, I offer up some reflections on Laphroaig's Quarter Cask expression, a popular one among peat heads and smoke hounds. I've been meaning to put this one through its paces for quite a while now and decided to just pick up a bottle on a whim a few weeks ago. So intense - like liquid smoke. Very enjoyable, it's so easy to see why it's so popular.  Cheers,  -Jobu  ----  ##Laphroaig Quarter Cask  Islay, 48% ABV, US$53.00 for 750ml (local)  ----  **Color:** Gold  **Nose:** Iodine / BAND-AID^®, smoke, peat, rum and prunes, hints of chocolate and molasses or something tropical and sweeter, like yam or coconut  **Palate:** Full-bodied, intense, thick yet velvety. Substantial smoked peat at the start. Salted butter followed by very quick hits of carmelized oak, maple syrup and malt. A dollop of hot peppery spice that tickles the nose round out the palate just before the finish.  **Finish:** Medium-to-long length and fulfilling. Rubbery smoked peat and more peppery spice resolve into a pleasant pipe smoke aftertaste and a widespread warmth.  **Score/Remarks:** 90/100 - Well this one just warms the soul, doesn't it? Definitely not for the feint of heart nor those who don't want a challenge. This dram is forward, strong, and commanding. Full of earth, smoke and dark tones, this expression pulls no punches. There's a slight (maybe weak or anemic are better words) sweetness that tries to temper the boldness of the peat and smoke but it just can't compete. And just FYI, this is the perfect malt to accompany your burger, medium rare, topped with mounds of melted bleu cheese and maple-infused bacon. Recommended.",®

t5_2snuc,jez2718,1367956667,"&gt;Those are two very different objections. The latter is just confused. Cantor's theorem is much more plausible than the idea that there is a set of truths which you can quantify over to get ""for all x, x=x"".  Then what are we to make of principles like the LEM then (or equivalent axioms)? The axioms of propositional logic would seem to be more fundamental than the theorems of higher-order theories like set theory. What does ""p is true or false"" quantify over.   On another note as I've been sitting on this for a while, it would seem that Grimm's argument can be applied far more broadly then simply to omniscience. What I've been tinkering with is the following analogous disproof of the KK principle. (note: it's formulated using predicates to quantify rather than sets, but this can be trivially modified and makes the argument stronger. I'd have done so myself but writing it out and specifying all the propositions with quotations was soul-destroying)  ##Clarifications  To clarify, in (8) φ(x) denotes any sentence featuring x as a free variable.   (9-16) is cantor's diagonal argument  (22-29) is the proof that if h injectively maps **E** to **K** then #**E**≤#**K**  ##Argument   (1)	**K**p↔SKp  (definition)   (2)	**E**Ψ↔∀p(Ψp→**K**p)  (definition)  (3)	h(Ψ)=""∀p(Ψp→**K**p)"" (definition)  (4)	f:P→Q↔∀x[Px→∃f(x)(Qf(x))] (definition)  (5)	∃S∀p(**K**p→**K****K**p) (KK principle: assume  for *reductio*)  (6)	∀p∀q(**K**p &amp; **K**q→**K**(p &amp; q)) (premise: conjunctive distributivity of knowledge)  (7)	[dummy premise as like hell am I changing all of the numbers]  (8)	∀φ∀Ψ[∀x(Ψx→**K**φ(x))→**K**(∀x(Ψx→φ(x)))] (6,7)    (8a)	  x is a ψ↔Ψx (definition)    (8b)	  ∀ψ(**K**φ(ψ))→**K**(∀ψ φ(ψ)) (6)    (8c)	  ∀x(Ψx→**K**φ(x))→**K**(∀x(Ψx→φ(x))) (8a,8b)  (9)	#P=cardinality of the things (x)  which P refers to (i.e.for which Px) (definition)  (10)	#P=#Q↔(∃f:P→Q)[∀x∀y(Px &amp; Py→(f(x)=f(y)↔x=y))  &amp; ∀z(Qz→∃w(Pw &amp; f(w)=z))] (premise: Hume’s principle)   (11)	#**E**=#**K** (assume for *reductio*)  (12)	(∃g:**K**→**E**)[∀p(**K**p→**E**g(p))  &amp; ∀Ψ(**E**Ψ→∃p(**K**p &amp; g(p)=Ψ))] (10,11)  (13)	∃Ω∀p(Ωp→**K**p &amp; Ωp↔~[g(p)]p) (by property comprehension)  (14)	∃ω(g(ω)=Ω) (2,12,13)   (15)	Ωω↔~Ωω (13,14, absurdity)  (16)	#**E**&gt;#**K** (15,*reductio ad absurdum*)  (17)	∀Ψ(**E**Ψ→∀p(Ψp→**K**p)) (2)  (18)	∀Ψ(**E**Ψ→∀p(Ψp→**K****K**p)) (5,17)   (19)	∀Ψ[**E**Ψ→**K**(∀p(Ψp→**K**p))] (8,18)  (20)	∀Ψ[**E**Ψ→**K**h(Ψ)] (3,19)  (21)	h:**E**→**K** (4,20)  (22)	**K**\*p↔**K**p &amp; ∃Ψ(**E**Ψ &amp; h(Ψ)=p) (definition)  (23)	h:**E**→**K**\* (21,22)  (24)	∀Ψ∀Φ(""∀p(Ψp→**K**\*p)""=""∀p(Φp→**K**\*p)""↔Ψ=Φ)  (premise: propositions that explicitely refer can only be identical if their referents are)  (25)	∀p(**K**\*p→∃Ψ(**E**Ψ &amp; h(Ψ)=p)) (22)  (26)	#**E**=#**K**\* (10,23,24,25)  (27)	∀p(**K**\*p→**K**p) (22)  (28)	#**K**\*≤#**K** (9,27)  (29)	#**E**≤#**K** (26,28)  (30)	#**E**&lt;#**E** (16,29, absurdity)  (31)	∄S[∀p(**K**p→**K****K**p)] (30, *reductio ad absurdum*)  ##Comments  ~~The main contentious premise as I see it is (6), as there may be good reason to abandon the closure principle in light of closure-based scepticism~~. (24) is potentially arguable, but in set theoretic language it says that the propositions ""X⊆A"" and ""Y⊆A"" are identical if and only if X = Y, which seems reasonable. Other than that the big question is whether **E** and Ω are legitimate predicates, but when we recast the argument back into set theory they fit the axioms. ~~(7) is an interesting premise to critique, but I'm assuming that S is borderline intelligent here.~~  EDIT: faulty reasoning cleaned up  EDIT #2: clarifications moved to top, headings added",↔

t5_2qyt6,randonymous,1367975920,"The reason to not label something 'GMO' is because a 'GMO' label does not inform.  A more appropriate, ""ingredients"" style list makes a lot of sense.  If you want a good law, make the genes look like ingredients. For example:  ""Genes known to differ from wild-type plants:      Vitamin B Synthase     Protexion™ (Roundup-resistance)     HSP456 (Frost-resistance)     Clatherin IIa deletion (Inhibits pollen formation)""  Sticking a 'GMO' label means nothing because everything is modified - by nature, by accident, or by guided or designed accident. UV light 'modifies' genes. Labeling something 'GMO' only further diseducates the populous and makes them fearful of something they could and should actually have a hand in deciding.  Such a list would enable the populous to discuss what kinds of genes they do or do not want.  That is an informed and interesting debate.  Do we want to add vitamins?  Resistances?  Patent-enforcing suicide genes?  These discussions would allow the public to decide, much as they did with high fructose corn syrup, under what conditions these modifications make sense.  Not that a whole technology is somehow 'bad'.",™

There is no difference in an organism that started as a grass and was selected to have larger kernels over the course of 10,000 years and one which does the same thing via injection of the 'GrowBig™' gene.  Because the GrowBig gene probably was the *exact* same gene selected for over the course of those 10,000 years.  The argument that we can do more than the above is certainly true.

t5_2qh16,Billpayment,1367988418,"Except you're ignorant about mass murderers too:  African Americans and Serial Killing in the Media: The Myth and the Reality Anthony Walsh Boise State University Homicide Studies, Vol. 9, No. 4, 271-291 (2005) DOI: 10.1177/1088767905280080 © 2005 SAGE Publications There were many expressions of shock and surprise voiced in the media in 2002 when the “D.C. Sniper” turned out to be two Black males. Two of the stereotypes surrounding serial killers are that they are almost always White males and that African American males are barely represented in their ranks. **In a sample of 413 serial killers operating in the United States from 1945 to mid-2004, it was found that 90 were African American. Relative to the African American proportion of the population across that time period, African Americans were overrepresented in the ranks of serial killers by a factor of about 2.** Possible reasons why so few African American serial killers are known to the public are explored. The major source of information on serial killers was the encyclopedias of serial killers written by Newton (1990, 1992, and 2000) and by Wilson and Seaman (1983, 1990), as well as the works of other authors. Newspaper and Internet sources were used for cases that occurred after 1999. The study identified 90 African-American serial killers and 323 White-American serial killers within the time frame of the study. African-Americans were represented among serial killers at a rate approximately twice their average percentage in the population (approximately 10.5 percent) across the 58-year time frame. Why, then, does the media limit its coverage of African-American serial killers? In answering this question, this study suggests that the media’s fear of racism accusations constrains its coverage of heinous crimes committed by Africa-Americans, compared with the zealousness of its coverage of such crimes committed by Whites. Also, African-American serial killers may have been more hidden from the mainstream culture when their victims were other African-Americans, particularly in the early 20th century. Criminological studies of serial killers also neglect to point out Black overrepresentation in crimes generally considered a White domain. The myth that serial killers are rarely African-Americans has had two detrimental effects First, Whites tend to argue that Blacks are not sufficiently psychologically complex or intelligent to commit a series of murders without being caught. Second, police tend to neglect the protection of potential victims of serial killers in African-American communities.   Really you have no argument, because everything you say is some fucking leftist propaganda that's been programmed into you because you've been a good little drone.    Want to know the difference between liberals and conservatives? Conservatives check facts and think for themselves. Liberals let people tell them what to think.  The gun homocide rate is HALF what it was 20 years ago in this country. Again: You've been programmed with misconceptions about pretty much everything you discuss.

The name of the company was *Airbomb™*,  and we were in the business of selling Canadian mountain-bikes and parts into the U.S. through Point Roberts, while receiving American bikes and parts via USPS and UPS.   It was a stock play, but also a valid business model. Sadly, when 9/11 occurred, we had hundreds of packages headed to the U.S. with heavy metal parts in them. The shutting down of North American airspace for a week, accompanied by the delivery costs associated with such a crisis were major blows. Evan worse though was when all these packages labeled *Airbomb™* started showing up in mail-rooms across the U.S. and frightening the workers. So hundreds of these packages were refused and sent back to us. Then the FBI called wondered aggressively how we dared to conduct business with such a name.    As valid an argument as they had, I needed to point out that the frame and fork had been shipped separately, and that the complainants should expect a  [*Marzocchi Bomber™*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Marzocchi_Bomber_MX_Comp_Mountain_bike_fork.jpg) fork to arrive the next day.

For anyone interested:  * Get [PowerDefragmenter](https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=94a12102e5094675&amp;id=94A12102E5094675!218) ([Softpedia Mirror](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Hard-Disk-Utils/Power-Defragmenter.shtml)) ([read about it](http://my.opera.com/rejzor/blog/power-defragmenter-3-0-released)). It's basically a GUI for Contig that gives you some basic control over defragmenting. * Get [Contig](http://live.sysinternals.com/Contig.exe) from Microsoft Sysinternals. (This is not necessary and you can skip this step, PowerDefragmenter will download Contig on it's own.) * Unzip PowerDefragmenter and put Contig inside of it. * Run PowerDefragmenter and select the option to **Defragment Folder(s)...** * Browse to Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\ and select that as the first folder. * *Optional* - Type in another Folder Location %appdata%\Guild Wars 2\ and select that as the other folder to defrag. It will defrag the Local.dat file inside.  **Important:** Do not run Guild Wars 2 while this is defragmenting, wait until it's done. This can take up to half an hour.  If you want to check and see how fragmented your .dat files are, you can try something like this.  * Open a Command Prompt (with admin access for ease of use) by typing in cmd in the Search bar. * **cd** to the directory where Contig can be found. * Enter the following (including quotes) and press Enter:  &gt; contig -a ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\gw2.dat""  You'll now see something like the following:      Contig v1.7 - Makes files contiguous     Copyright © 1998-2012 Mark Russinovich     Sysinternals - http://www.sysinternals.com          -------------------------------     Processing C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\Gw2.dat:     Scanning file...

If it says the file is in 1 fragment, there's no need to defragment as it's already optimized.   I hope this helps people get a better gaming experience.

t5_2rnve,Tall_bright_stranger,1368009204,"OK. There are a few changes, I can recommend:  1) Harddrive: Choose a 1TB WD Black drive instead (60SEK extra). A single SSD is not enough space for a PC you want to keep for a long time. WD black are very durable and fast when it comes to normal harddrives - and you're going to need more than 120GB.  2) Minne (RAM):  	Kingston ValueR. DDR3 1333MHz 8GB, CL9 Kit w/2x ValueRAM 4GB DDR3. You'll need 8GB soon enough, so that's a sensible upgrade.  3) PSU:  	XFX ProSeries Core Edition 550W PSU. The corsair CX series are discount units with some quality issues. An XFX 550W unit will last a LOT longer, be less noisy, deliver more power, and keep your PC components more stable. This upgrade will pay for itself over time and allow you to just swap out the graphics card in the future (simple as that - the easiest upgrade there is).  4) CPU: Intel® Core i5-3470 Processor. It's a very powerful CPU and will allow you to make your next upgrade in 3-5 years very cheap - you only need to get a new graphics card. This Core i5 can handle very fast graphics cards without becoming the bottleneck in your system (GeForce Titan is no problem for this CPU).  ____  It should come to 6780kr and you get Bioshock: Infinite, Tomb Raider and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon as an added bonus (value: about 800SEK).  Now you've got a PC of overall much higher quality, with tough long-life components, that's VERY cheap to upgrade in the future.  For a memory upgrade, simply add another set of 2x4GB 1.5V 1333MHz (or higher) memory blocks.  For a graphics upgrade, simply buy a new graphics card and replace it with the old one.  -Mr. Tall",®

t5_2qh0u,accountt1234,1368014037,"In this topic:  White Redditors gather around in a circle to jerk about how pretty Ethiopians are (as Ethiopians have a facial structure similar to Caucasian people and their aesthetic ideal, with thin noses and high cheekbones and an elongated body build), so they can feel as if they too, are *not racist*™!  You're not being *not racist*™, you're being divisive.  If I'm an American black woman of Nigerian descent who always sees whitey circlejerk about how pretty those Ethiopian women are, what do you think that insinuates about me? I don't have the elongated Ethiopian body build, but rather have a voluptuous body, and I don't have a thin narrow European nose, but rather a wider and shorter nose.  If you're continually telling people how ""beautiful"" the Ethiopians are, you're telling other African people reading along that they're not beautiful.  It might instead be better if you just keep your opinion to yourself, and accept the following: Your opinions are arbitrary and based on your own background. White people consider white people beautiful, Nigerians consider Nigerians beautiful, Japanese consider Japanese beautiful.  If your sense of beauty is irrational and xenophobic (you like women who look like your mother or men who look like your father), that means it is not threatening to other people. I like the looks of white people. And if you're not white? That means you can just reject my opinion as irrational, which it is.  However, when in your attempt to be *not racist*™ you try to establish a scientifically objective determinant of beauty that divides one part of the world into beautiful people and the other part into not-beautiful because of their hereditary differences in facial appearance, you're putting people into a status as a permanent underclass.  Don't try to fix your perverted white guilt complex by dividing foreign races into ""pretty"" and ""not-pretty (by implication)"", you're just making the problem worse. ""But I never said other races are not pretty!"" Well, if a girl is completely ignored by every boy in her class, do they still have to say to her that she's not pretty? Of course not, the message is perfectly clear.  Accept your irrational preferences for your own people, and we can discard your opinion as irrational and maintain our own irrational preference for *our people*. This way none of us have to feel inferior to any other group because we don't inherit your objective standard of beauty (""cheekbones huge eyes and incredibly clear skin"").  Thank you very much.

To criticize the study for using rats ""prone to tumors"" is the same straw-grasping as what it's criticizng - tumor-prone rodents are a common feature of bio research (see also, the patented OncoMouse®) and are perfectly accounted for by controls of the same type. The scientists launching such criticism know this intimately, or should, and are guilty of the same class of reprehensible deception.  It should be considered *heavily* that this is an issue in the science world that's tied to unimaginable sums of money and conflicted interests, involving countless researchers in many fields, from agronomy to epidemiology, many of whom rely on companies like Monsanto for their funding.  My reasons for GMO skepticism are simple. The stakes involved with GM crops are as high as they come: an **indelible** imprint on our entire biosphere for all time. Never mind how incomprehensibly complex and synergistic these ecosystems are - to think that we can predict all these effects ""enough"" rings of the highest folly. Such bold risk-taking can often be good for a species, but for *Homo sapiens* and in my book, GMOs fall quite short of the ""lottery win"" that would make such gambling worthwhile.",®

I don't want to attack you for that, because seriously, what would be the point in polarisation? I just want to make you understand the issue better, and asking questions is better than info-dumping. But maybe I should be more verbose.   For one, I never said you are defending the attackers. I said that you recognise how wrong the incident was yet you say ""But they shouldn't choose to live in that village"". That's putting blame on them, for whatever reason.   You also know around the term 'alternative lifestyle choice'. But being gay is neither a lifestyle, nor a conscious choice. Gays don't live all the same lifestyle. Me, I live the lifestyle of the Total Nerd™ :P I know other LGBTs who live the 'teacher' lifestyle, or the 'retail shop employee' lifestyle... Secondly, it's not a choice. Instead of Anglogermanic couple who decided to life Act 2 of their lives in Cyprus, it could be the teenage son or the daughter of a village there, who was gay/lesbian. Is their fault again too for not moving out of Cyprus when they hit puberty? That's the realisation I was hoping to trigger. (And on that matter, parents abuse their LGBT kids all the time, but we'll never know because of the gay-shaming and the keep-your-lifestyle-to-yourself attitude. Even for those adult men we are probably seeing a covering-up in progress).   I know very well that Cyprus is not a LGBT-friendly place. I live here. But you are seem to making the point that LGBTs should just move abroad, which is their right but it shouldn't be their only choice, don't you think? Everyone who things that attack was wrong should say 'it's time we dismantle the taboos and make bigots see LGBTs as people, and maybe then the next generation of people can be free of fear and focus on living their life instead of hiding it"" (even US republicans stop being so biggots when their family members come out as LGBT, because 'heck, that's my sister, that's my nephew, they are not queer monsters like I was raised to believe, and I want them safe and happy'). So, if you see people in the scope of ""alternative lifestyle choices"", you are really going to have a hard time understanding them. ",™

Is this true?   &gt;A: Rest assured: laboratory tests confirm that Drano® is safe for all types of pipes and plumbing fixtures!   &gt;This is actually a common question we receive, so we’d love to clear things up. Our products are powerful enough to dissolve those nasty clogs, but they will not harm your plastic or metal pipes, so there’s no need to worry. Additionally, Drano® products are safe for septic systems and will not harm the bacterial action that occurs in septic systems.   &gt;In fact, Drano® Max Gel contains a special ingredient that prevents pipe corrosion and “Safe for all pipes, septic systems and cesspools” is printed on the product packaging of all our products.   &gt;Be aware, however, there are other drain openers on the market that could cause damage. We recommend avoiding acidic chemical cleaners that contain sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid.   &gt;Hydrochloric acid can damage porcelain, metal and almost any other material when used incorrectly. Sulfuric acid is slightly less damaging to metal plumbing but can still damage aluminum, stainless steel and porcelain. These chemical cleaners should be used as a last result and by a professional. To keep your pipes safe when you’re using a drain opener, we recommend sticking with Drano®. ",®

t5_2ug83,NoseFetish,1368046766,"I don't think this is as much a generalization as it is a gender role men fit into. There are a lot of people in the world who won't do something nice without expecting a reward. It just so happens when it comes to relationships that many men try to rush it or make it happen right away, they have unrealistic expectations about sex. Men continue to perpetuate this generalization which is why it's brought up and the trope 'nice guys™' has come from, and probably why many of our messages here have a sexual theme to them.  We're basically calling their actions assholish, because they are. I'm not like this either, and most of my friends who are dudes aren't like this, but I know a lot of guys out there who are like this. I constantly see on this website the idea that men and women can't be friends, if a woman has a boyfriend they 'abandon thread' because their attention would yield no possible reward. Generalizations are often made of women on this site, and not many people seem to say anything about it. But when you generalize something men do, or when I or others I have seen try to point out the misogyny on this website, no one wants to address it.   We have to be able to examine man's collective misogyny without people getting offended by it, because it isn't limiting all men or you with the brush, but it's out there regardless if you have experience with it or perceive it or not. Unfortunate;y there are multiple other factors that actually perpetuates this idea among younger men, and I'm not so sure this one joke is the culprit of it.  Part of my major gripe with mensrights groups and many other men is they're unwilling to admit their own privilege and to examine gender roles and how they affect how they see women and the world around them. If we can't bring up issues within the psychology of men, how is it ever supposed to get better or improve? Pointing out a gender role that men may fall into really is nothing like the rooted misogyny or racism out there that is generalizations. This isn't the same as all women are bitches or all minorities are a certain way.   Guys like the ones in mention make it worse for the rest of us, and if you're not like that you shouldn't be bothered because he's not trying to reinforce a gender role, but examine it using humor. Normally the people bothered by these things is because they identify with it, but even though statistics worldwide say men are more likely to be killers, rapists, stalkers, abusing children sexually, and commit violent crimes, I don't identify with that when someone points it out using comedy to examine it like [Louis CK did.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4LkrQCyIz8). I believe your disgust is misplaced. You should be disgusted with our fellow men who perpetuate this idea, and other media and reinforcement of gender roles for men to be like this. I've found in my lifetime, and observing others, that men are the most sexist to other men. If I don't live up to another mans idea of what it means to be a man, they criticize my masculinity, they try to effeminate me, or put me down. I think humor like this may cause some guy who has a circle of friends who do act like this to think critically about how he sees relationships and women.   This link explores the nice guys phenomenon.  http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/ng.shtml   One last thing that kind of irks me, is comparing it to women and minorities, when doing so neglects how institutionalized oppression and views are towards women and minorities. Men have always been subject to the class system like everyone else, but have enjoyed what many would say is a privileged stature in our society. I'm all for standing up for oppression and straying away from generalities, but not when it comes at the cost of never being able to examine gender roles and how misogynistic men can be towards women. This website is a prime example of how we objectify them, love them, and hate them.   We have to shame the idea that women are sex objects, we have to shame mans obsession with sex because it blinds them from seeing a woman as a whole person and not just what she can do for them. We have to shame these unhealthy gender roles that diminish the value of others experiences in life, because it prevents both men and women from fulfilling their full potential.   Turn the tables. If it was a gender role for women to demand money after having sex with men, and every time men brought this up that we felt devalued as a person and that our experiences in life were tied to something superficial women told us that we need to get over it or that it was generalizing them, we would never be able to get to the root of the problem. The huge difference here is that if this was true, women wouldn't be using you as men use women. You would be exchanging your body for her to gain access to something superficial, whereas this gender trope for men exchanges something superficial, niceness, for access to a woman's body. ",™

There are a lot of people in the world who won't do something nice without expecting a reward. It just so happens when it comes to relationships that many men try to rush it or make it happen right away, they have unrealistic expectations about sex. Men continue to perpetuate this generalization which is why it's brought up and the trope 'nice guys™' has come from, and probably why many of our messages here have a sexual theme to them.  Framing it this way is still a generalization, which is reinforcing the gender role that you speak of. There may be an abundance of men who have unrealistic expectations rooted in some kind of transactional view of sex wherein a nice comment begets a blowjob. No one is denying that, or this subreddit and social theory wouldn't even exist.   That being said, the comment in the original post is an indictment of men period. It ignores the multitude of men who shun this type of mentality or behavior, who openly question their own privilege, and whose ideas of romance and sex are rooted in as much of an equal reality as they can be (given that equality doesn't actually exist). Where are they? It says ""men period."" It's an erroneous generalization that, as I said before, is perpetuated by ""well, shit, men can't be kind without trying to bang you."" That first sends the message that all men fit into that mentality (which is a kernel of truth), and sends the message to younger men that they too should interpret kindness that way (thereby perpetuating that mentality).  &gt;One last thing that kind of irks me, is comparing it to women and minorities, when doing so neglects how institutionalized oppression and views are towards women and minorities.  I'm in no way ignoring the oppression of people who are non-white, non-male, and non-heterosexual (as I am two of those three). In fact, I'm saying that this approach of grouping all people in one category label into how we perceive the most vocal, the most noticeable, and the most appalling, is exactly that same perpetuation of ideas that are used to oppress minority groups in our society. This doesn't lead to oppression, but it still a bogus methodology. I can't support it in reference to minority groups, but I'd be a hypocrite if I then cheered on a gross generalization of men. Is it better because we're questioning privilege by grouping all men into one ugly box? I'm sorry, but as someone who has spent portion of his life fighting against people who fit into the creepyPMs posts, against inequality, and against the bullshit thrown around at people erroneously, I don't think so.

t5_2s48x,sllewgh,1368054312,"If you're having this problem, the map is probably ripe for a tactic I refer to as ""Troll and Roll™"".  Here's the out-of-date guide from my outfit's forums:  http://totalrecoil.boards.net/thread/421/troll-roll-comprehensive-guide  In short, take the path of least resistance in a straight line mad dash to the enemy warpgate, then surround said warpgate with your territory.  You don't need a connection to your own warpgate to keep pushing, unconnected friendly territory still allows you to take adjacent territories. It's a lot more difficult now than it was back in January when I invented the tactic.  For one, outfits are better organized and more responsive.  Also, the enemy has a lot more info about what you're doing because of the timers and other new interface elements.  Also, fixed capture timers means there's no way to rapid-fire take bases.  But rest assured, any incursion into enemy territory that pushes sufficiently close to their warpgate WILL ALWAYS 100% OF THE TIME pull enemies to fight you (sometimes multiple platoons worth).  All you need is enough people that a few enemies can't swat you away like a fly- one full squad is sufficient.  This has many benefits.  For one, you get that fight you want.  They WILL come to you.  Secondly, you can do it with even a fairly small force.  When I'm leading and don't have many troops to work with, I can't do much good at a biolab or tech plant, I can't take on a whole platoon with just two squads in a big base.  However, I CAN get that platoon to meet me where I choose with Troll and Roll™.  Sure, you won't win the fight, but you're drawing the enemy off the front line.  Your two squads have just taken an entire platoon (or maybe more!) out of the fight where it matters.  So, even if you just take the territory and then leave immediately as soon as the enemy platoon shows up, as I often do (hence Troll and Roll™), you've still taken them all out of the fight.  And, even in the remote chance that no one comes for you (and I must stress, this has NEVER happened unless the enemy is very low pop), you can cut off the supply lines to the entire enemy faction if they don't stop you.  Simple.  Effective.  Feasible with few troops.  Troll and Roll™.  Brought to you by PencilStick, TXR's resident troll-in-chief.",™

t5_2snuc,jez2718,1368055905,"&gt;Further, 8c doesn't follow from 8b. Or at least, I have no idea how you get that via a conditional proof using 8b.   The idea is that as a ψ is defined as an x for which Ψx (edit: it occurs to me now that in the transfer from Cambria to reddit font these different psi's may have become difficult to distinguish, which is unfortunate), quantifying over all ψ's is equivalent to quantifying over all x's conditioned on Ψx. For example  &gt;For all squirrels (s) [s is fluffy]   is equivalent to  &gt;For all animals (a) [a is a squirrel → a is fluffy]  Thus 8c substitutes every instance of the form ∀ψ [P] in 8b with ∀x [Ψx → P]       &gt;So φ(ψ) is any arbitrary formula of which psi is a free variable? In that case consider the formula ""ψx OR Red(x)"" where Red is a predicate. If for all ψ, **K**[ψx OR Red(x)] is true, that only gets you that **K**[[ψ^1 x OR Red(x)] AND [ψ^2 x OR Red(x)]...AND [ψ^n x OR Red(x)]], but this does not entail that it is known that for all psi, [ψx OR Red(x)]. At least, 6 alone does not get you this (you might not know, for example, whether you know every predicate).   So is your argument here that there is a distinction between knowing what is in fact every conjunct of a universal and knowing the universal? For example one might know that some parrot you own is red, and that it is of a certain species, but if you didn't know that that parrot was the only parrot of that species then you wouldn't know the universal ""all parrots of that species are red"".  So what is required to infer **K**(∀ψ φ(ψ)) is not simply **K**φ(ψ^1 ) &amp; **K**φ(ψ^2 ) &amp; **K**φ(ψ^3 ) &amp; ... **K**φ(ψ^n ), but also **K**(x is a ψ ↔ ∃1≤ k ≤ n (x = ψ^k )). I.e. one must know every conjunct and know you haven't missed a conjunct.   This seems quite a serious problem, as I can't think of a way of modifying (8) to account for this without this ""know you haven't missed a conjunct"" simply formalising to **K**(∀x(Ψx→φ(x))). This may require more thought.   I wonder if perhaps I am using a questionable general premise to prove a less questionable specific result. After all (8) is used in just one inference, which is the inference:  &gt;(18)	∀Ψ(**E**Ψ→∀p(Ψp→**K****K**p)) (5,17)   &gt;(19)	∀Ψ[**E**Ψ→**K**(∀p(Ψp→**K**p))] (8,18)   so the real question is, does ∀p(Ψp→**K****K**p) entail  **K**(∀p(Ψp→**K**p))? To simplify further using the trick above, define a q to be a p for which Ψp. Then the question is, is the statement  &gt; ∀q(**K****K**q) → **K**(∀q(**K**q))  true? Your argument seems a bit less forceful in this case, as (at least in most theories in which the KK principle is true) the propositions that I know are internal to me, unlike the population of parrots.",↔

And let me tell you, it handles dry and wet roads like everything was covered in Velcro®  The Downside is depending on your driving habit they only have a life of about 55,000km  I've gotten way longer out of them.  I do believe I bought them in 2009, but they are due to get replaced.  I didn't drive them in significant snow till the 3rd year and I was a bit iffy with them, but I think that is they were a few years older and the tread is so wide.  Performance and handling I found to be great, no chirping off the line or when making a left on a wet road and giving it some gas, (they do now but are old)  when I first got them I had to lay on the brakes super hard and I swear I though the car was going to stand up on it's two front tires they stuck so well.    The drawback to them is they are a bit noisy, and expensive.  I am thinking of getting a different kind but the All Weather feature is great and I like how they handle in the rain.  As we get lots of rain where I live, snow not so much, but it gets icy and they do okay.  Someone told me they are 20% less than an actual snow tire.  Also take into account mine are a few years old, and the guy at the tire store said they have upgraded the compounds to make them improved.",®

Progressives and conservatives are the hardest to convince, most probably, because they believe their One Vision^© is the True Vision^© and that everyone should bow before their whim and live in their mould as they desire. Still, as things worsen, as I expect them to, it should become more abundantly clear that no one group has sufficient hegemony to enact their policies and only their policies with some semblance of purity.

t5_2qm4e,kwoodward130,1368088076,"Many difinitions can be given to oxidation and reduction reactions. In terms of electrochemistry, the following definition is most appropriate, because it let us see how the electrons perform their roles in the chemistry of batteries. Loss of electrons is oxidation, and gain of electrons is reduction. Oxidation and reduction reactions cannot be carried out separately. They have to appear together in a chemical reaction. Thus oxidation and reduction reactions are often called redox reactions. In terms of redox reactions, a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent form a redox couple as they undergo the reaction:  Oxidant + n e- ® Reductant Reducant ® Oxidant + n e- An oxidant is an oxidizing reagent, and a reductant is a reducing agent. The reductant | oxidant or oxidant | reductant Two members of the couple are the same element or compound, but of different oxidation state.   Hope this helps! ",®

Then, yesterday, I get some Dell ad in my physical mailbox containing among several others this computer from Dell. Great I first think, but on the front page of the broschure it says ""Dell recommends Windows"" (OK, they can do if they want but I do not give a fuck about Windows), then inside the broschure  it says ""Windows 8""/""Windows 8 Pro"" on every damned f-ing model. WTF??  So, even physical ads is just bullshit, they are laughing at me.   I didn't throw it away, I am contacting Dell and tell them that they seem to have a problem.",❣

It wasn’t long until things changed though. That day was different. Maybe it was something about the way the clouds formed, or something in the air, I don’t really know, but I could just feel something different that day.  I went into work feeling a combination of dread and excitement. Maybe today will be the day I get a raise. Or maybe I’ll get laid off. Either way, I knew that a major change in my life was going to happen that day, for better or worse.  I kicked off the work day like normal. Grabbed some coffee, parked at my desk, caught up on some emails and then hopped onto /r/braveryjerk. That’s when it happened.  I looked at my most recent post and there it was, staring me in the face like a deer in headlights. A downron. I was visibly shaken, and dropped my coffee and pile of memos. I stormed out of the building crying those brave crocodile tears, the same tears braveryjerkers cry for the unlimited breadsticks available at your local Olive Garden™.  The next day I quit my job and devoted myself to a life of solitude, never to leave. The lack of bravery I witnessed that day changed me. I could no longer deal with trials and tribulations of social interaction and swore that I would never let myself be hurt again.  Please, don’t let this happen to someone else.

t5_2r7ks,opportunityprofessor,1368113236,"What will future leaders  look like?  With the release of the iPhone in 2007, we entered into a new age, increasingly saturated with ready access to a whole new world of information.  That was a game changer – especially for leaders.  Where we once could lead by controlling, commanding or coercing, now we must upgrade our leadership software by connecting, coordinating and collaborating.  To fail to make this step is like sticking with our old flip phones that limit our performance, productivity and profits.  That is rather STUPID, isn’t it?  SMART leaders look ahead, anticipating the future, sensing and seizing phenomenal opportunities to advance their organization, careers and communities.  Meanwhile, STUPID leaders, defend their ego against any offender of their ingrained traditions, training or tactics.  Which one do you think will work better in the future?  Let’s look at 6 of the most compelling trends in our society and assess the leadership challenges involved.  Trend 1:  Technology allows us all to access almost endless information very quickly.  Challenge for Leadership:  Employees no longer need a leader that primarily dispenses information and that will likely lead to needing fewer leaders, especially at the middle manager level.  As work duties shrink due to technology, organizations will see this as an opportunity to cut costs.  The SMART leader will be wise in monitoring the viability of their position.  The SMART leader will also be wise to collaborate with both subordinates and superiors to expand their influence inside and outside the organization.  Are you online with this thinking?  Trend 2:  Technology allows for easier tracking of performance.  Challenge for Leadership:  Less time is needed to monitor employee performance so the SMART leader will not only lead and manage differently but also expand their influence in new directions.  Upgrade the software of our thinking.  Trend 3:  Globalization has flattened the cultural hierarchy, creating an increasing demand for egalitarianism.  Challenge for Leadership:  Employees will demand more respect, therefore believing that they have much more to offer their employer than the STUPID leader will appreciate.  SMART leaders will respect the employees for what they can offer.  As offensive as it is to the STUPID leader, employees will demand that the corporate change by voting with their feet.  The Dictatorial approach makes us STUPID leaders who are constantly hunting for good employees.  Generation X and Y will not put up with what the Boomers do.  Are you plugged in to this thinking?  Trend 4:  Employees and potential employees are much more adept at solving problems.  Challenge for Leadership: The SMART leader will tap the problem solving savvy of employees by connecting with them other job functions but also with their outside hobbies and interests.  Anticipating the intersection of internal and external work knowledge will help solve strategic problems in sales &amp; marketing, research &amp; design, recruitment (to name a few.)  Are you building a network with your employees?  Trend 5:  An increasing number of people see themselves as entrepreneurs.  Challenge for Leadership:  The top down management style will not work with those who are self-driven.  Employees of all levels will refuse to work for dictatorial managers and STUPID leaders because it is neither pleasant nor productive.  To attract and retain employees, we must transform into SMART leaders who collaborate to construct a compassionate corporate culture that is compelling for SMART employees.  Otherwise, we will be off the grid.  Trend 6:  Increasing transportation costs combined with an increasing emphasis upon work-life balance leads to a more virtual work situations.  Challenge for Leadership: Mix in the previous 5 trends and you have an increasing demand for working from home or long distance with flexible work hours.  Become more flexible and proficient in communication and expectations, learning to connect, coordinate and collaborate will eclipse the need to control, command or coerce.   Are your employees on your friend list?  Are you up for the challenge?  Stay tuned for my posts on  Monday and Thursday of next week to learn about changing the hats of our leadership thinking to sense and seize our ultimate opportunities.

t5_2vudb,Evil_This,1368115033,"EDIT: **Foreward** - Sorry for turning OP's thread into info about my Nephalim.  Promise I wasn't trying to hijack.  TL;DR: it's big and bad and justified - if it's not, then it's probably not for you, but that's cool too.  The power supply is one of the most important factors in the process, but considering that switching AC-DC power supplies have been in use for over 40 years in consumer goods, I made the brave assumption that everyone understands them and how they work.    The most important details about the psu are that they put out a nominal 5V10A DC voltage, when connected to standard 110VAC power supply (a normal house power supply).   Because ""nominal"" does not mean actual, and manufacturing of switching power supplies is sometimes results in deviation (for safety purposes, or to ensure it exceeds the nominal rating), each device is individually tested by me and marked to ensure the user knows the voltage they're operating with.  Some at 5.4, some are 5.5, some 5.3, all of them a minimum of 5V.  Also, I offer a **6 month warranty** on the power supply.  Anything happens, email me and I will replace it.  I think that's more than enough *talk* about the PSU, honestly.    As to the PSU itself, and it's effect on my ""made in the US"" narrative - the 3rd page of my owner's manual explains each component and here's what it says about the PSU:  ------------------------  **Power Supply** There are no appropriate made in the USA switching power supplies which provide 5V10A power - a design requirement for the Nephalim™ APP.    All power supplies are, however, US sourced from a company that has provided lighting and power solutions to small businesses for over a decade.  Full wiring diagram is available. &lt;the diagram is linked&gt;.  ----------------------------  You're right - most of the work did go into the mod in hand, and yes there's quite a bit of room.  I did not choose any inferior or low-tolerance components.  Build costs could have been reduced by almost 20% if I chose an inferior switch.  The DC jacks are designed to withstand a significant amount of force as well as a lifetime of ""actions"" (plugging and unplugging DC plugs).  Every part of this could have been made much less expensively, and with less care and workmanship but fuck that - this is what makes the Nephalim stand apart among devices.  Another place you're right - it is **big** because it feels nice.  It's not as big as you think.  it's about as tall as an 18650 and an 18350 stacked atop each other. room because I intended users to be able to modify the device as they saw fit.  The next version (available in 2 weeks to a month or so) will come with a battery solution - most likely a non-recharging compartment into which an 18650 will fit for on the go use.  The DC jacks are already capable of switching from battery supply to DC power as soon as the plug is inserted.  One thing I will clearly say to the price/build of it.  Yes, it's *essentially* a DC barrel to 510 adapter with a switch in the middle.  Every mech mod is essentially a to-body negative with a single post connecting to the positive on a 510 adapter of sorts, with a switch somewhere in the middle of that.  You're describing every mech/semimech/electromech mod ever.   And VV/VW mods only also put a control in the middle of that.  It is what it is.  It is a badass, decently sized (it's not ginormous by any means, nor overly heavy) device intended for power vapers to get 5V vaping and a 10A threshold without battery rape.  It does that and it's awesome.    Lastly, as to the cost of the device - listen, no one is making serious money out of this and least of all me.  I think the machinist is making a little bit of profit, the aluminum provider is probably making a few cents on the pound, the anodizer also probably makes a little off each unit, the parts suppliers are probably making a few cents per item, and those sites reselling them are making a little bit.  I just chose to get as much of the money into the hands of American businesses (most of them small businesses) instead of into Chinese slavers' hands wherever possible. (I'll forego the macroeconomics rant.)    I myself am not-quite breaking even here.  I'm not in this for profit by any means, I wanted to get what is an awesome vape into more peoples' hands - because it shook me the first time I vaped on DC power, and I know others will feel the same.  There are also people who are just goddamn sick of cheap, shitty Chinese garbage mods that break the first time they fall over.  This is for those people. ;)  ",™

Contrary to Smith’s claims, most food-allergy experts believed that there was almost no chance that Starlink contained an allergen, while the EPA advisory panel apparently felt there was some very small but real chance it could become an allergen (CDC 2001, Lemaux 2008, Hefle and Taylor 2001). The problem observed with Cry9C is that it digests slowly in the simulated gastric fluid assay.  This doesn’t mean it is an allergen since indigestible proteins are not necessarily allergens.  At the time of the Starlink episode, known expert scientific opinion was backing away from an earlier proposition that protein indigestibility was an indicator of potential allergenicity.   More recently, some experts say that we should move away from the digestion assay completely because it is not predictive of allergenicity (Goodman and others 2008).  The EPA and EPA expert panels placed too much emphasis on the digestion assay.  They treated poor digestibility as an indicator of allergencity and did not sufficiently weight other data such as the fact that no Cry protein has ever caused human allergy or that the Bt protein in question, Cry9c, does not possess any structural resemblance to any known allergen.  It may be that EPA was too precautionary in their approach and sought 100 percent certainty that Cry9C was not an allergen.  &gt;3.  People were scared by the recall and many attributed their illnesses to Starlink. It is an unfortunate and well-documented fact that when scares like Starlink are announced and people then become ill, they will naturally attribute their illness to whatever is being recalled.  Think about it. If you ate a taco, became ill a couple of hours later, and then heard that taco shells were being recalled by the government, wouldn’t it enter your mind that maybe your illness was due to the taco you just ate?  Consumers can’t be criticized for thinking that if something is being recalled it must be dangerous.  In fact, dozens of claimed Starlink-related illnesses were carefully investigated and not a single subject had an IgE antibody that reacted with Cry9C—the Gold Standard test required to show allergenicity (Hefle and Taylor 2001).  There is no evidence that a single consumer was actually hurt by Starlink.  http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/summary.htm  &gt;On October 25, 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in investigating adverse event reports (AERs) of human illnesses that were potentially associated with consumption of genetically modified corn products. Prior to these reports, a protein named Cry9c had been inserted into genetically modified StarLink™ corn; it subsequently and inadvertently was introduced into the human food supply. CDC conducted an epidemiological investigation that included (1) reviewing the AERs, (2) administering questionnaires to all people who experienced adverse health effects and manifested signs and symptoms consistent with allergic reaction, (3) obtaining relevant medical records, and (4) collecting serum samples for temporary banking. The investigation concluded that 28 people had experienced apparent allergic reactions. These people had also reported eating corn products that may have contained Cry9c protein. With the endorsement of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Scientific Advisory Panel which convened on November 28, 2000, CDC recommended that the banked serum samples be evaluated to see if they contained evidence of an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;An FDA laboratory developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect antibodies to the Cry9c protein. CDC sent coded serum samples to FDA for analysis, including serum samples from the affected people and historically banked serum samples collected before Cry9c entered the food supply. CDC also sent serum samples from people identified as being highly sensitive to a variety of allergens. The ELISA method found that none of the CDC-submitted samples reacted in a manner consistent with an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;These findings do not provide any evidence that the reactions that the affected people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Cry9c protein. The difficulties of this investigation highlight the importance of evaluating the allergic potential of genetically modified foods before they become available for human consumption.",™

A comparable sample from the United States would count only twenty-two Jews among 1,000 representative Americans.  &gt;In the sciences, Jews have won 22 percent of all the Nobel Prizes ever awarded - 29 percent of the prizes since 1950, after the Holocaust destroyed a third of their numbers.

They have won 123.  &gt;The Fields Medal, awarded to the world's brightest mathematicians under age 40, is the honor John Nash, of the book and movie A Beautiful Mind had hoped to win. Instead, he took a Nobel Prize in economics as a consolation prize. One-fourth of the Fields Medals winners are Jews.  &gt;Encyclopedia Britannica provides its list of ""Great Inventions."" Of the 267 individual inventors, more than 13 were Jews, including Zoll (the defibrillator and the pacemaker), Land (instant photography), Gabor (holography), and Ginsburg (videotape). Jews are represented on the list 22 times more than one would expect based on their population.  &gt;They are disproportionately counted in most of the arts. Since their respective dates of inception, America's leading symphony orchestras have been led by Jewish conductors one-third of the time. They have created nearly two-thirds of Broadway's longest running musicals. Probably one-fourth of the greatest photographers of all time have been Jews, as have 10 percent of the world's great master architects. Of movie directors who earned Oscars, 38 percent were Jews. In broad artistic recognition, nearly 30 percent of the Kennedy Center honors and 13 percent of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards have gone to them.",©

t5_2r7ks,opportunityprofessor,1368211946,"How will future leaders  look different?  With the release of the iPhone in 2007, we entered into a new age, increasingly saturated with ready access to a whole new world of information.  That was a game changer - especially for leaders.  Where we once could lead by controlling, commanding or coercing, now we must upgrade our leadership software by connecting, coordinating and collaborating.  To fail to make this step is like sticking with our old flip phones that limit our performance, productivity and profits.  That is rather STUPID, isn't it?  SMART leaders look ahead, anticipating the future, sensing and seizing phenomenal opportunities to advance their organization, careers and communities.  Meanwhile, STUPID leaders, defend their ego against any offender of their ingrained traditions, training or tactics.  Which one do you think will work better in the future?  Let's look at 6 of the most compelling trends in our society and assess the leadership challenges involved.  Trend 1:  Technology allows us all to access almost endless information very quickly.  Challenge for Leadership:  Employees no longer need a leader that primarily dispenses information and that will likely lead to needing fewer leaders, especially at the middle manager level.  As work duties shrink due to technology, organizations will see this as an opportunity to cut costs.  The SMART leader will be wise in monitoring the viability of their position.  The SMART leader will also be wise to collaborate with both subordinates and superiors to expand their influence inside and outside the organization.  Are you online with this thinking?  Trend 2:  Technology allows for easier tracking of performance.  Challenge for Leadership:  Less time is needed to monitor employee performance so the SMART leader will not only lead and manage differently but also expand their influence in new directions.  Upgrade the software of our thinking.  Trend 3:  Globalization has flattened the cultural hierarchy, creating an increasing demand for egalitarianism.  Challenge for Leadership:  Employees will demand more respect, therefore believing that they have much more to offer their employer than the STUPID leader will appreciate.  SMART leaders will respect the employees for what they can offer.  As offensive as it is to the STUPID leader, employees will demand that the corporate change by voting with their feet.  The Dictatorial approach makes us STUPID leaders who are constantly hunting for good employees.  Generation X and Y will not put up with what the Boomers do.  Are you plugged in to this thinking?  Trend 4:  Employees and potential employees are much more adept at solving problems.  Challenge for Leadership: The SMART leader will tap the problem solving savvy of employees by connecting with them other job functions but also with their outside hobbies and interests.  Anticipating the intersection of internal and external work knowledge will help solve strategic problems in sales &amp; marketing, research &amp; design, recruitment (to name a few.)  Are you building a network with your employees?  Trend 5:  An increasing number of people see themselves as entrepreneurs.  Challenge for Leadership:  The top down management style will not work with those who are self-driven.  Employees of all levels will refuse to work for dictatorial managers and STUPID leaders because it is neither pleasant nor productive.  To attract and retain employees, we must transform into SMART leaders who collaborate to construct a compassionate corporate culture that is compelling for SMART employees.  Otherwise, we will be off the grid.  Trend 6:  Increasing transportation costs combined with an increasing emphasis upon work-life balance leads to a more virtual work situations.  Challenge for Leadership: Mix in the previous 5 trends and you have an increasing demand for working from home or long distance with flexible work hours.  Become more flexible and proficient in communication and expectations, learning to connect, coordinate and collaborate will eclipse the need to control, command or coerce.   Are your employees on your friend list?  Are you up for the challenge?

However (yes I know this is not how you're supposed to do apologies, but please bear with me), I made this thread in order to elicit responses, as I believe the question is an important one. Does self-help really help? My grandmother reads a lot of self-help material, and honestly, I don't think any of it has helped her become a better person.  I am, at least to some degree, of the opinion that the best way to do something is to go ""cold turkey"". Cut the crap, and Just Do It™  But perhaps you are onto something. Are these issues; procrastination, social awkwardness, poor physical condition due to lifestyle choices (or rather the lack of them) a result of something deeper that a person cannot pull him/herself out of, sort of like depression?   It might be, and I guess the question lies therein. And, it certainly is comfortable to stand behind that reasoning. But! And this is a large ""but"" for me. I was in horrible shape, procrastinated like no one else, stayed home and didn't talk to people much and I was also quite heavily addicted to video games.  Now I work out regularly, I get amazing grades, I have met tons of new people, I'll be traveling to the Netherlands the 27th (I live in Europe by the way) and work as a volunteer on a farm for a month, and I don't know anyone there nor do I speak the language. And I have never, as you probably have understood, been a fan of self-help.  I have done it. I have done what people on this subreddit strive for. I really have.   So, if I can do it, why cannot other people do it? If I can snap out of it without help, why can't you?   In other words, my experience is that these issues are not due to being stuck in some form of psychological quicksand, but in fact due to laziness, and that in turn the people on this subreddit trick themselves into believing that they suffer from some sort of larger problem, when everything it actually takes is to get out of the chair and do it.  But still I made this thread. Why? It's because I'm not certain. As I stated earlier, perhaps you're right. Perhaps it is like depression in many ways and that I am a very rare case, one of the lucky ones. I made the thread to receive responses, which could possibly make the situation clearer for both myself and others. If you have a story to share, please do so!   If anything is unclear, please don't hesitate to ask. English is my second language and sometimes sentences turn out differently than how I want them to be.    ",™

t5_2s3qj,avatarr,1368228044,"All correct (obviously, since he figured it out). Now let me explain some of the hints:  **Old ones needed saving; new ones don't care:** Refers to the first clue, i.e. screen savers. CRT's needed screen savers. LCD's [generally] don't.  **The Monster popular in 1994 knows the answer:** People sort of got this one. It was referring to the album Monster by R.E.M, specifically What's the Frequency Kenneth (suggesting Kenneth knows the frequency), hinting that the numbers were frequencies. The REadMe.txt is also somewhat of a double clue here. It hinted that the case of the contained password was a mix of lowercase and capitals as well as also hinting at R.E.M.  **The Gryllidae sound before year one:** Gryllidae are crickets, as people got. What's before year one? The answer is Year Zero. If you Google ""Crickets Sound Year Zero"" the answer isn't far down the list and should be fairly obvious once you see it. This hints at the spectrogram since the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero was a scavenger hunt of sorts, one clue of which was a spectrogram on the album (cricket sounds) that gave a phone number.  _Incidentally, I spent the most time on the damn mp3 trying to get it just right. I did throw quite a few red herrings in there hoping to spur on conversation about it. I did not expect the numbers and the notes to trip people up like they did. Sorry about that._ **☹**  **The body is the key where the Key is over water:** The body of water where the Key [Bridge] is = the password, i.e. Potomac River.  **39.624383, -77.252183:** The GPS coordinates to the birth place of Francis Scott Key. If, on the Google Maps page, you select the Wikipedia layer, it will show Terra Rubra and tell you it's the birth place of Francis Scott Key. Also, if you convert it to DMS format, the google search becomes slightly easier.  **http://imgur.com/OpSS3eO:** A picture of the Francis Scott Key bridge and the Potomac River.     *** __***Those were the original clues. Once people started getting stuck, Fabian suggested some more to help things move along...***__  **A popular track holds the answer:** Another hint about the specific track, What's the Frequency Kenneth, rather than just the album name.  **000.00 000.00 000.00:** The mask for the numbers showing that it's 2 decimal places.  **Windowlicker:** A [super obvious, perhaps too obvious] hint to go the spectrogram route.  **It comes after the turn:** As in the flop, turn, river in Texas Hold 'em.  **Make the shift with 266f:** When people were _still_ having trouble with the numbers, I posted this last hint. 266f is the unicode designation for the sharp music symbol. The shift meant to use the shift key for capital letters for the notes that were sharp.",☹

We had a family dog, female cocker, she loved to lick and smell down there, so eventually let her lick, first time I was 11? Anyways, we did that many times and learn to do more stuff by try and error, then Internet was a savior, sex guides, asking for help, getting tips, then I become an excellent lover.

t5_2qknd,CoolGhoul,1368237173,"No worries, hope you found it useful. :)  I haven't read the Avatar trilogy yet (soon™, taking a break from D&amp;D), but Finder's Stone was very entertaining IMHO, especially the second book. I know that they're both essential reads, particularly Avatar, due to the impact of the events therein.  As far as important novels within FR go, I would also suggest:  - [Evermeet: Island of Elves](http://www.amazon.com/Evermeet-Island-Elves-Forgotten-Realms/dp/0786913541/), detailing the history of, well, Elves, written as an elven historical opera. - [Cormyr Saga](http://www.amazon.com/Cormyr-Forgotten-Realms-Saga-Book/dp/078690710X/), it's similar to the one above, but about one of the most important countries in Faerûn.  To be fair, none of the D&amp;D books are particularly deep or complex, but as far as enjoyable fantasy goes, I can easily think of worse. If you're a gamer and anything like me, they also give playing Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or Temple of Elemental Evil an enjoyable sense of familiarity, as it's fun to recognize locations and characters mentioned in those games.",™

t5_2s30g,no-novelty-account,1368239160,"I hate the unhelpful ""it'll pass"" (non-)advice, so here's advice from a not-so-experienced guy:  **Regarding positions:**  * **Angle** This is different for everyone it seems, but a certain angle will probably always get you off more easily than another. Find which ones help you last longest and use them. For me it is having my penis perpendicular to my body (better, pointing downwards)  * **View** What turns you on visually? I love ass, and so seeing a girl's behind helps me get off. Of course, that's ""help"" I'd rather not have, so I keep that for the end.  * **Concentration** I've found that if she's on top, I can concentrate more on *not* coming. not foolproof, but it helps.  **Additional tips:**  * How long you last may depend on the girl. I myself have found that vagina size is a *big* factor (smaller helps me last longer) but I'm sure there are many other factors involved that I haven't figured out yet.  * Condoms help, but I think they are counter-productive on the long run. Here's an idea: use a ""long lasting"" condom to make a point to her and yourself. Some of these make it practically impossible you to ever finish. Next time, when you'll have nothing to pove to anyone, use the thinnest-feeling condom possible. Alternate. That way you can progress and not feel self-conscious.  * In the same vein as the above: alcohol. (WARNING: here's a point where it helps, and then there's a point where you're no longer functional in that department)  * learn about the feeling leading to ejaculation. Sometimes it takes me by surprise, but sometimes I can predict it. Try to slow down in these moments. If that doesn't work, exit *before* the point of no return and make use of hands and tongue. Go back to what you were doing when your colleague downstairs has calmed down a bit (WARNING: doing that for too long with a condom on your dick can be problematic)  * The obvious like jerking off prior to intercourse (Women: blowing your man benefits you too)  **TL;DR:** Use a desensitizing condom one time out of two and drink some good wine (or bad vodka). Get her to blow you. Point your dick at an awkward angle, check out her unsexy bits, let her grind you.  Then proceed to ***Thrust, Learn, Improve.™***",™

Once I found out about it, I think I knew deep down what was up even though I still tried to fight it for a few years.  I couldn't pinpoint any specific event that really drove the point home, so I think it was more gradual.  &gt;You are who you are and interesting because of the hard times.   I feel like this was meant with good intentions, but it is a bit condescending.  While it's certainly true I was mocked, yelled at, spit on, thrown into walls, told I was going to Hell, and had my things stolen or destroyed on a weekly basis (not to mention several death threats, two stabbings, and being shot), I get no solace from the fact that these make me a more interesting person or that they inform my opinions about LGBT rights.  It really just made high school suck a lot and made me very bitter for a while, although I've come to realize that I did not make the situation easier on myself by having such an acid tongue.

t5_2qhnf,illarraza,1368248105,"The SGI is a Destructive Cult by Definition  1). Destructive cults actively recruit new members, often through deceptive “front” organizations.  The SGI has the Boston Research Center, the Institute for Oriental Philosophy, Human Rights Education Research association, 7/11 [hehe] and others where their affiliation to SGI is rarely if ever mentioned.  2).Destructive cults claim to offer absolute Truth. Their teachings are not (to them) mere theory or speculation. The most effective cult doctrines are those which are unverifiable and unevaluable.  The SGI claims that their believers are the only Nichiren Lotus Sutra believerscapable of obtaining Buddhahood, going so far to claim that all SGI members are Buddhas while those of the Nichiren Shu and Kempon Hokke, for example, are “deluded Shakyamuni worshippers”.  3).Destructive cults reduce everything to a bi-polar attitude: “for us, or against us.”  Anyone who criticizes the SGI, no matter how wise, is a fool and anyone who praises the SGI,no matter how foolish, is wise. Daisaku Ikeda writes, for example:  “Seven years have passed since then. The outcome of the struggle of good and evil and the workings of the law of cause and effect have been strict and uncompromising. The decline of the crazed and destructive Nichiren Shoshu is clearly apparent. The victims, unfortunately, are the la ybelievers who practice with the temple, who are not aware of Nichiren Shoshu’s evil and have been deceived by the priests.”  4).Destructive cults generate some kind of external “pet devil” with which to threatentheir members if they should doubt, or fail, or ever leave the group.  The SGI has dozens of  “pet devils”. Those who leave will have misfortune on their jobs, in their families, in the social lives,have accidents, fall into hell, etc. President Toda stated: “If you keep this up, you’re going to cometo a pitiful end in life.” and “Betraying the Soka Gakkai is betraying the Daishonin. In the end, they’ll receive the punishment of the Buddha, you’ll see.” Ikeda says, “To take action to fight against whatever forces appear as the enemies of the Soka Gakkai is our most noble mission.” Matilda Buck says, “How tragic it would be for even one person to have found the great means of bringing forthBuddhahood only to be diverted to another, seemingly similar, path that is incapable of leading thatindividual to his or her deepest happiness.” This is the jist of the Gakkai’s attempt to chain themembers to the Gakkai way of life. The Biggest ”pet devil” is Nikken of the Nichiren Shoshu:  “When Buddhism speaks of “devilish functions,” what does that really mean? These represent whatever tries to prevent us from advancing in our Buddhist practice. In a sense, they are frightened when we expand the Buddha?s forces, because the realm they want to control will the nbe changed into a pure land. In our case right now, this function is being manifested in the currenthigh priest of Nichiren Shoshu.”  5).Destructive cults lead their members to believe they are somehow superior to all other humans on the earth.  In many of Daisaku Ikeda’s speeches we see how the SGI members are to view themselves:  “Sons of the Gakkai”, “Inheritors of Myoho”, “Lions of the Mystic Law”, “The sole group of true believers”, “Truly praiseworthy are you who resolve to work hard for kosen-rufu and the SGI. You are the most noble of all people.”  6).Destructive cults put the will of the group above the will of the individual. This is often reinforced with simplistic games or rituals of some type designed to make the individual subservient to the group.  If you search, you will find such quotes from the eternal Soka Gakkai mentor, “the Soka Gakkai is more important than my life.” We also see the special Soka Gakkai holidays like May 3rd, day of mentor and disciple, and such slogans as, “reaffirming the prime point of the Soka Gakkai”  We see inordinate references to Soka Gakkai, SGI, and Ikeda in nearly every experience given by an SGI member. There used to be dress and hair (short) and beard(none) codes for the SGI Young Men’s Division and on saturdays everyone had to dress in whitepants and white tee-shirts.7).  7).Destructive cults teach that the end justifies the means.  How they misuse upaya (expedient means) is a travesty. Flirtatious shakabuku by young women’s division, telling peoplethey can get new cars and even drugs if the chant, teaching people that they will immediatelybecome Buddhas if they join the SGI, and the list goes on and on how they utilize the ends justifythe means philosophy of Machiavelli, the antithesis of the Buddha’s teachings.  8).Destructive cults teach strict obedience to superiors and encourage the developmentof behavior patterns that are similar to those of the leader.  Is there any doubt why the SokaGakkai is known throughout the ten directions as the Ikeda cult? Guidance division, never criticizing leaders, “follow no matter what”, this is so apparent to everyone but the brainwashed SGI memberhimself. Lately, the SGI has abandoned any subtle pretense with such overt youth division guidelinesas, “  Reveal your true identity as Shinichi Yamamoto” and “I want to be ShinichiYamamoto”  9).Destructive cults offer acceptance by the group for good performance, and conversely,withhold it for poor performance.  Moving up the ladder from Jr Group Chief, to Group Chief, toDistrict Chief, to Chapter Chief, to Area Chief, to Territory Chief, to Joint Territory Chief and so on.Busting people from their position or moving them at the leaders will.  10).In destructive cults, fear is a major motivator. Guilt is a close second, and shame isthird. Only the cult leader is perfect, so everyone below is fearful that those above willfind out their shortcomings. Cult members feel constantly guilty for having those real or imagined shortcomings, and are ashamed that they haven’t worked harder to get rid of them.  “Never talk about your problems to the members until they are resolved.” “Did you know that so and so got hit by a car and is paralyzed. He should have stayed with the Soka Gakkai.” “She turned in her SGI Gohonzon and lost her job and her house.” “He committed suicide not soon after joining the Nikken sect.”  11).Destructive cult members swing from emotional highs, to emotional lows regularly. Lows are not long tolerated, and result in more indoctrination, or even ejection from the group if they last too long.  Here are some examples of SGI speech used to control their members: “You have weak faith.”. ‘You had better go for guidance if you want to resolve that problem”. Rumors to stay away from depressed individuals. Not inviting less than enthusiastic members to certain meetings or not telling them about “important” meetings. Lectures about “emotionalism”, [unless the emotion is rapture about the SGI and the mentor]. Every last former SGI cult member will attest to this.  12).Destructive cults tend to re-write their members’ past, manipulate their present, and distort their future. Disrupting time orientation is an honored technique of all such cults.  Human Revolution, New Human Revolution, New New Human Revolution. Need I say more?  13).And, finally, there is never a legitimate reason for leaving a destructive cult. The only reason members leave a perfect system, is because they are imperfect in some respect and will be punished for it.  “He was angry.” “He was jealous.” ""He couldn’t get along with his leader.” “He had weak faith.”  (even if ""he"" continues to chant three hours a day and does shakabuku with the Nichiren Shu or the Kempon Hokke). “No matter which destructive cult you choose, the above 13 items will almost universally apply"".  The author of these 13 points [whose name escapes me] then goes on to conclude: Study the methods of est, LaRouche, Transcendental Meditation, Truth Station, Soka Gakkai, TheWay International, Children of God, Temple of Set, Synanon, Scientology ®, The Peoples Temple, Unification Church, Hare Krishnas, House of Judah, Ramtha, Garbage Eaters, Rajneesh, ECK, ChurchUniversal and Triumphant, Elan Vital, Posse Comitatus, or any of the others…. they use the same techniques, even though each of them claims unique and absolute ownership of the “truth.” ",®

t5_2qh1o,Moshhu,1368278699,"THAT'S AWFUL!!!  Your dad's doing a sweet thing, he clearly loves animals &amp; it's unfortunate that this happened, the poor thing.  I assume the dog was lovingly discouraged from a repeat offence?  As a stray, who knows what that poor dog might have experienced on it's own to make it snap like that; it could've been starved, abused, abandoned, sick- who knows?  Are these dogs being seen by a vet?  IMO, I would understand if not since that could get terribly expensive, but I still think your day's doing a great &amp; loving thing either way.  Maybe EVERYONE in the household could research ""stray dog health/behaviour"" or something like that, not only so you continue to provide the best possible care (I imagine you might already be doing this stuff) so you guys can pick up on any possible subtle warning signs to prevent this from recurring; I think everyone who spends time with dogs needs to know this valuable information whether there are cats or kids in the home or not, since there are kids &amp; all kinds of animals outside that the dogs are bound to interact with.  Just a suggestion, hope it helps!  Best of luck! 😊",😊

t5_2s8h0,Davidmuful,1368286390,"No-knead generally uses a small amount of yeast and a relatively long amount of time to develop gluten and yumminess™, whilst kneaded bread (what I think you mean by this) flips the ratio, more yeast and less time.  What no-knead has as an advantage is that it, in general, tastes way better for the home baker to make than the equivalent poundage of traditional home baked bread that only takes 2 hours to make - the kind of stuff you find in cookbooks written by chefs, not bakers. But in essence both are just different ways to develop the dough into something that will bake properly in the oven.  These big companies make bread the quickest and cheapest way they can, which is with a lot of yeast and kneading. It doesn't make particularly nice bread, but again it depends on the company. Artisan bakers will often have several different breads that use a different ratio of time and kneading to each other, big operations will invariably gear it towards less time. That help?",™

Money Plant (Epipremnum aureum)  	* Excellent for removing Formaldehyde and other VOC’s 	* Best grown using hydroponics  How do we know this works? We have tried and tested these plants for 15 years at Paharpur Business Centre and Software Technology Incubator Park (PBC™ – STIP) in New Delhi, India. It is a 20 year old, 50,000 ft2 building, with over 1,200 plants for 300 building occupants. PBC™ – STIP is rated the healthiest building in Delhi by the Government of India.* Their study found that there is a 42% probability of increasing blood oxygen by 1% if one is inside the building for 10 hours. Also, compared to other buildings in Delhi, the incidence of eye irritation reduced by 52%, lower respiratory symptoms by 34%, headaches by 24%, upper respiratory symptoms by 20%, lung impairment by 10-12% and Asthma by 9%. As a result of fewer sick days — employee productivity also increased. * Study published on September 8, 2008 by The Govt. of India, Central Pollution Control Board and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India We conducted another experiment and sealed all fresh air and exhaust from the building for 6 weeks and found that that the air quality inside the building was better than outdoors. We saved over 15% in energy costs as we did not have to inject 15-20 cfm of fresh air in to the building as suggested by ASHRAE – an industry standard. ",™

t5_2qiel,Noddan,1368318891,"The way I see it, there is basically two different hockey leagues this year, with drastically different play styles. The 'East NHL' has a fast high goal scoring style of play resulting in higher total point counts. On the other hand, the 'West NHL' has a more defensive style of hockey, which ultimately means less points for the top players, even if they meant the same to their teams.        What many people will fail to notice is that this has the opposite effect for goalies. Two of the three Vezina nominees this year were from the west, and 70% of the top ten goalies were surprisingly, in the west. Nobody is complaining about that, now are they.         Because the short season split the conferences, in order to more fairly determine the true winners, we need to either hand out two of each award, of compare the player's stats within their own conference. For example, Taylor Hall finished 1st in western conference scoring, and (had his team made the playoffs 😢) is certainly worthy of Hart consideration, but since he is 9th in league scoring, he isn't even looked at.         Finally, as others have pointed out, the worst flaw in the system is the fact that the west coast media sees first the east coast games at 4, followed by the west coast games at 7, whereas the east coast media only sees the east coast games at 7, and won't stay up to see the 10 o'clock games.

Deep fried Triple-Layer Shamrock McSpaghetti salad cheese melts will pass, a burger and a shake are forever.  3. Drive in's &gt; Drive thru's. Get the fuck out of you car and be with people FFS. Seriously, no one is making you interact with your species but you know you feel better when you do.  4. Rootbeer Float.    5.

I shudder to think what might be happening out of sight at an In n' Out.  7. Their phone number is on their website: (206) 634-0300, and under ""contact' they list the phone number of each location.  8. The coup de grâce. They treat their employees really well. [I had several friends that worked there.]  Seriously, here is from their ""employment"" page: Health and Dental Benefits Dick's offers 100% employer-paid health insurance and employer-subsidized dental insurance to every employee who works at least 24 hours per week (which amounts to over 75% of our employees.)  Educational Scholarships College, vocational/self-improvement scholarships up to $22,000 over 4 years to employees working 20 hours per week for at least six months and continuing to work at least 20 hours per week while attending school.   Childcare Assistance As an extension of our Scholarship Program, childcare assistance of between $3,000-$8,000 per year is available to employees working 20 hours per week for at least six months -- and continuing to work at least 20 hours per week while receiving childcare assistance. If an employee doesn't use any or all of their available scholarship funds for tuition, they can use it for childcare.  Paid Community Service We feel it is important for our employees to get involved in our community. Our community service benefit encourages employees to help local charities. Dick's will pay volunteer-employee's their regular hourly wage for up to 4 hours per month of volunteer time.  Higher Wages We pay employees at least $10.00 per hour to start (higher than the amount typically paid by Dick's competitors and well above the current minimum wage). Merit raises can increase your hourly wage to $10.50 per hour within three months. Shift Managers earn up to $4.00 per hour over-and-above their base wage. Store Managers earn considerably more.   -Life changing? No burger is life changing.

It is a multimedia children’s adventure. In this powerful, yet fun-loving tale about a little princess who is trying to recover the stolen moon from a couple of mischievous musicians, we are taken on a journey filled with adventure, beauty and ultimately self-discovery.  In its creation, there has been a collaboration of artistry from the fields of music, fine art and literature and the result is a proverbial story of working together and learning respect for each other and for nature. To reinforce those lessons the book contains a curriculum component that can be used by educators, parents and guardians alike.   An additional theme of the work places a focus on multiculturalism. As the world around us grows, our interaction with people from other cultures becomes more common. Learning about and from these cultures is both vital and beautiful. -   On sale now at www.princessmarisolandthemoonthieves.com  youtube preview: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GXnKzzS5Adw",♥

t5_2qhn3,mjgialanella,1368333535,"Marriage and Family Therapist here. ODD is bullshit. Did papers in undergrad on it, worked in a Residential Treatment Center as an intern and got hired for a year, assisted with research at NIMH for several years on kids with ODD and Conduct Disorder (more severe symptoms, but some similarities) and the relationship with their parents. ODD is usually diagnosed in adolescence, but I've seen a lot of younger kids getting diagnosed with it. Read the criteria and it is essentially diagnosing an adolescent who is exploring independence (teenagers are just big toddlers).  I'm going to divert for a second, but I'll get back to ODD...I strongly encourage the parents who are saying their kids are diagnosed with ADHD to first get a blood panel done to address hormone and vitamin levels. Second, explore diet or allergies as possible explanations. Get a physical, too. Biology before psychology. Finally, and this is one that I feel VERY strongly about, the symptoms of anxiety (and depression for that matter) are very similar to ADHD. I'm not saying ADHD is complete bullshit, but I would say that in the 11 years I've been a therapist (including supervising other therapists, counselors and social workers), not one kid I've worked with who has been diagnosed with ADHD didn't have some element of anxiety and/or depression that were better explanations for his/her symptoms with a pretty clear story of the roots of the symptoms ONCE THE PARENTS WERE ASKED ABOUT IT. Far too many kids are given this diagnosis (ODD, ADHD or both) by a teacher or primary care physician who wants to give the kid meds and not explore what the true issue may be. At best, it's an incomplete diagnosis. Autism spectrum, while a much more legit diagnosis, is the latest version of ADHD in my option. More and more kids are being diagnosed with it for whatever reason. Maybe it's accurate, but I'm really not sure. Some kids I work with have been diagnosed or had it as a rule out diagnosis because the kid is simply more introverted than others. I know a lot of creative, caring, curious kids who have been labeled and drugged up because their style of learning or their interests were just different. It's disgusting and a shame. Also consider sensory integration issues or learning disabilities as a possible underlying explanation to what you see on the surface.  Back to the original issue with ODD, please keep in mind (and I'm not saying this is the issue with your step daughter) that for kids depression often manifests as anger, aggression, sensitivity or frustration. Again, think of a toddler who thinks they are the center of the universe, they know everything, they want to do everything for themselves, but they also want you to be there immediately when they want help and they are realizing that people listen when they say ""no."" Add to that that they may not have the ability to identify and communicate their emotions. My ""Jump To Conclusions Mat""™ makes me curious about when you first noticed her symptoms and then go back between 3 and 6 months and you might have your answer to what triggered the initial change in her behavior.   As far as treatment and future prevention, my bias says work with a family therapist who will emphasize the benefits of empathy before going to behavior plans and the like as the solution. It's not to say contracts and behavior plans won't be brought up or they aren't effective, it's a matter of WHEN (if ever) they need to be. There is a balance between empathizing with a kid who is struggling and maintaining clear and consistent boundaries and expectations. I used to do a lot of play therapy with younger kids and I dropped it to focus more on teaching the parents the skills I was doing in sessions (which is called filial therapy). It's much more effective than the 45 minutes I'd do with a kid to then send him/her back to the same environment with nothing different. Often parents are in greater need of therapy than a child is.  I read 123 Magic years ago in grad school and from what I recall it's a solid place for parents to start. I think there's a teenage version out there, too. I'm a big fan of Scott Selles' work (difficult.net) for working with families. At 15, I'd work with her individuality a little and give her opportunities to share what's going on, but I would put more focus on you and her mom or working with all of you at once. I also wonder what's going on with your wife and how that might play a role in things. Kids want structure, but they also want to be respected. Being a tyrant isn't the answer just as being lenient and passive isn't the answer, either.  If there's a chance I can help, I'd be happy to answer any questions you (or anyone else) might have. Just message me and we can exchange info. I hope it goes without saying, but I'm not the type to try to charge someone for something like that.  Best of luck. For you to reach out to Reddit about this definitely shows you  care about your stepdaughter and want to understand every way you can help. It also says your tired of your wife's approach to things and want a way to help her do things differently because the current way isn't cutting it! ",™

t5_2qrct,rdac,1368335881,"Sorry for the novel, but here's my experience from both a small business and corporate perspective. A lot you probably already know, but I hope you find it worth the read.  - My advice? If you already have a degree, don't go back. Depending on your creative, drill more and build a great portfolio. At your/our age, experience matters more than education in design. As a Creative Director, show me that you've got a personality that will mesh well with our collective, that you're knowledgeable about the brand, you're interested in the position, and if your portfolio is this good, the rest will melt away. Talent and age will buy you some grace, just have an answer when they ask 'why the change,' such as I've seen it for years, admired from afar, and I think I can do better.  - You're never going to get younger, but you can be more qualified. Possibly go get your Adobe Certs, and try for a hybrid position (manager/low-level director/even PR). Sell them on your portfolio, your life experience, and explain the strengths that you have that no one else will. With all that copy experience, if you've got a good forward-facing personality and can play the game, you might make a great team lead until you can get a larger role. Certs can get you past the HR check, and then your portfolio will win you the job.  - Can't get a larger role? Start anywhere, and stay hungry. As long as you're always learning, you'll always be valuable. One of the reasons I mentioned PR before is that I had some great copywriters in the past, but when it came time to design a mail/email/etc. piece, they were completely lost. Again, you can do double duty, move up the ranks, and rack up live work if you're in the right place at the right time (and PR is all about the deadlines, today today today) and it's obvious you got the art team's back. Discuss, be inclusive with other depts, and don't be at odds with anyone until you have enough clout or reason to. The best advice I ever got was to pick your battles, because it doesn't matter how right you think you are - everyone has their own opinion, and sometimes it matters more than you (or your gainfully-employed status, so watchit!).  - Get fast and mean with your illustrations (don't focus immediately on making 'agency' pieces, do things common people would want and need, and be able to do them quickly).  - I tell my talent to embrace their inner bad idea generator -- unplug from reality, brainstorm freely, and keep the best...because once you've dreamt up all the bad ideas it could be, all you're left with is good. Also, be able to shotgun out ~30 concepts (good or bad, but at least informed) for anything without blinking, given a half hour of research. This teaches you to be creative in a crunch situation.  - Surround yourself with only good. Be able to see bad design for what it is, but after that, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE. It is the path to the dark side - your brain likes to associate and make patterns, so make sure it's getting fed daily with good principles and great stock. Keep this in mind, lest your brain fall back on something horrid when you need it to turn it out.  - As a starter, you may be tasked to take agency-driven creative and branch it out across a brand. Be good at reinforcing a brand image, and be able to internalize the 'bylaws of the brand.' Over time, it should show in your designs, and will even let you expand quality base creative into things that fall perfectly in line with the original, but are purely you. It'a all about living the brand.  - That being said - drink the kool-aid, but tweak the sugar. By that, I mean that sometimes the brand needs to be freshened, and throwing something in the mix that is a new element might set it off from the rest, and make you the star designer of the team. Part of that takes time, because you'll need to figure out which mouths to feed, and who to keep quiet. By that, I mean that a large group will execute death-by-committee, but if you can find the major players without stepping on too many toes, you can create with those tastes in mind and be able to push through creative that is accepted and highly successful.  - Once you have the 'people behind the people' trusting you, then you've got built-in cheerleaders and champions. One technique I've used before is finding my power players in the group, and been inclusive to them on a one-on-one basis (sort of a internal focus group/product team). I've never been a yes-man, but I'll include their input, and explain my reasoning behind a given large-scale design that I'm trying to push through. Once they've had some pre-input, they'll see it in the design and fight your battles for you, whether or not you're there - because now there's shared thought ownership.  - Judge Dredd is not the law - deadlines are the law, and you are probably very familiar with them. Sell that - a freshman designer may have some tricks, but a sharp eye and a good watch beat them out every day. Again, your level of experience and references will save you (aside from the fact you may sell yourself as too expensive for their tastes, even though you'll take what you can get). Make sure they know from the first interview - nay, the first line of your resume - what your intent is when applying. BE CLEAR and possibly a little shameless - if they're buying what you're selling, don't be afraid to open up and explain that you want the experience in a way that doesn't undermine your value. They're gonna want to know how they can afford your Brand of Awesomeness® without writing off that you're going to break the bank.  - Hate to say it, but with age comes some level of responsibility, work ethic, and loyalty. You could be somebody who's not only professional, but won't show up late(r) than accepted, will be able to do the job needed quickly (experience sometimes equals efficiency), won't bring in too much drama and will be stable, because you've got more to work for. You've got an internal reputation, and folks who count on you already. As an employer, I respect that and want to add it to my mix.  - Fresh recruits out of college vs. experience...well, let's say it's like asking someone to bring light to a room, given any amount of resources.  One man stumbles in the dark, starts up a campfire, and the smoke trips the fire alarm, putting the light out.  The next man setus up a gerbil high on adderol powering a flywheel which lights the light bulb, but the poor thing faints after a minute and the room goes back dark.  The last man quickly scans the room as the door shuts and asks for the lights inside the room to be turned on. Resource granted, you win.  TLDNR: fresh meat's gonna go all-out on whatever I give them, spend way too much time working on a solution, waste my time with the details and not ask the good questions upfront.  This is also the scariest hire for a group, as per their portfolio will be clever, clean, and will have taken all four paid-for-by-parent (not hating on those lucky enough to have that level of support, but this is purely off of my experience) years to create - so of course it's strong...but you're always left wondering how - how much is theirs and not their schoolmates, how quick can they create, how valuable is their input going to be, and how are they going to perform under pressure. Normally a simple scratch pad test will tell me a lot about if they've got what it takes. An interview is about as high-pressure as it gets, and if they can create while that's happening, and you see their confidence shine through, you've got a star. But, I digress (sorry).  - If that's too cryptic, I know that most junior designers I'm hiring are going to leave after 1-3 years. One reason is that I have a knack of finding and forming raw talent who just end up being successful. It's a great and terrible problem to have - if you recruit the best, they're just going to go up. Another reason is purely location - we're small, but in a top market and in close proximity to other much bigger markets. One more reason is that younger designers have the modern mentality (rightly so) that the only path to promotion is horizontal and not vertical.  Some companies have the same opinion when it comes to brand leadership, which is why they look from the outside when they have great teams with great ideas that would be better/cheaper, if they'd only look within. I could tell you stories...but getting off topic.  However, when hiring, none of those factors even matter - because all I want to know that my initial investment is going to pay off, I've found the right person, the CEO isn't going to behead me for hiring a lunatic (at least on a creative level), and I'm not going to have to retrain in 6 months because a paid internship/position opened up in a large-market agency. Stability matters, folks.  - Finally, confidence is key. I've worked with cocky, and I know the difference between the two - and it boils down to results. I can work around someone who acts like they're the best, as long as they are the best+. The '+' is for humility/honesty with both yourself and your team. I suffer from this big-time...I've got a rep for impossible deadlines, and if left on my own, I would project perfect-world scenarios that would be impossible for nearly anyone to fill.  I improved my confidence level and performance by being vocal, bouncing time tables off of staff and clients, and establishing conditions to be met on both ends. As delivery and product improved, my confidence did as well.  If you're asking if it's too late with work like that, you may need to work on it as well. If you've got folks to support, I can understand being nervous - but don't be. Once you're in the business, you won't have time for it...you'll be too busy being great.  In the end, I'd at least interview you based on that. As far as your portfolio, for some one-offs, that's some good stuffins.  Best of luck to you.",®

t5_2qh1i,ChainsawPlankton,1368337922,"&gt;You've got your Artists: the annoying, high-maintenance minority. This group includes specialists like pâtissiers (the neurologists of cooking), sous-chefs, butchers, garde-manger psychos, the occasional saucier whose sauces are so ethereal and perfect that delusions of grandeur are tolerated. Then there are the Exiles: people who just can't make it any other business, could never survive a nine-to-five job, wear a tie or blend in with civilized society — and their comrades, the Refugees, usually émigrés and immigrants for whom cooking is preferable to death squads, poverty or working in a sneaker factory for 2 dollars a week. Finally, there are the Mercenaries: people who do it for cash and do it well. Cooks who, though they have little love or natural proclivity for cuisine, do it at a high level because they are paid well to do it — and because they are professionals.  Bourdain, Anthony (2008-12-10). Kitchen Confidential (p. 62). Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Kindle Edition.   hell the food biz is self depreciating at times, I'd love to see some more ""professionalism"" but hey I'm not sure I know what that word means (need to learn, hopefully graduate college soon™).  I'm pretty damn timid myself, I like to observe and see how people respond to things, but at the same time if someone calls me Uncle fucker I'm probably just going to laugh it off (and probably call them something equally unsavory back, as they have set the tone).

t5_2rxrw,abom420,1368339402,"You need to realize there are different types of guys. Guys like me browse /r/onoff and /r/realgirls /r/gonewild etc.  The other type is tends to take their cues on what attractiveness is from the media. These people tend to generally learn/take everything they know or feel about themselves from it. They don't make their own decisions, so in their minds, you aren't ugly. You just aren't media. Their minds are binary. It's l/O. On or off.   You are either ""Maxim ® hot"" or you are ""fugly"". Nothing they do, see, think or say is original. So it's only normal they cannot find anything not portrayed like they saw in the media as hot. They don't know what ""attraction"" is. They learned to clarify things like colors. They don't have a feeling which states attraction. They look for cues like tan skin, caucaus region faces, long flowing hair, etc before they mechanically confirm it is attractive.   This is unfortunately how the world works. I think it's because the male identification is skewed for some. So while others are like ""Check her out, she's out"". The other guy is like ""Wut"", but due to fear of being embaressed he will agree anyway and judge looks based on what was confirmed as ""attractive"" from someone else from now on.  The other side is actually turned off by this. Almost every single ""cover photo"" type girl I see just immediately turns me off. It's weird. When I see the things like black hair, tanned skin, overly done makeup, skimpy outfits, loud toned girls fighting for attention, all of this somehow is a social cue to me that they are not attractive. Almost the opposite to what the others feel.  It's real weird. But trust me, you aren't ugly.",®

t5_2qyt6,forlasanto,1368376931,"Why do I work hard? So my family can get the best education, thereby raising their chances at success in life. It's very capitalist. Except, public school takes away the most productive years of learning. The education system itself is very communist; everybody gets the same chances, so effectively *nobody* gets a chance.  So lets find a happy medium. [Vouchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher). Then nobody is forced to send their kids through one school system or another. It shifts the burden of ranking schools from the government to the parents, *where it belongs*.   There is more to school than academic achievement. Beyond about 5th grade, the things actually taught in classrooms are actually about the least useful set of skills/knowledge a person can learn in school.   Statistically speaking, continued involvement in a scouting organization such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a much stronger metric of future success than academic achievement. So much so that Eagle Scouts will statistically earn [$1million more](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-confidential-cafe/305112-being-eagle-scout-much-more-important-you-think.html) than a non-scout over a lifetime. So what's the magic sauce? Well, arguably parental involvement, and that *is* a factor, but in truth it is about socialization--the passing of values from one generation to another. Socialization is a thing that [does not normally occur](http://voices.yahoo.com/homeschooling-socialization-vs-socializing-1610967.html) in public school.  So vouchers let us choose schools where socialization is the focus. It's not a panacea. There's still going to be cases where things go wrong. But at least it won't go wrong for *everyone across the entire board*, as is the case with public school today.  I say more charter schools and more private schools. I say fewer public schools, and those few will be in direct competition with charter schools and private schools where hopefully values are more important than grades. If the public school complex becomes a victim of paradigm change, that's a **Good Thing™**.  I want everyone to get some Kool-Aid. I'm just not a fan of everyone being forced to drink the same flavor of Kool-Aid. ",™

Extra credit:   A) there were 50 attacks on US embassies and consulates when Republicans/Libertarians ran all three branches of the Federal government. Republicans/Libertarians slashed State Department funds (hundreds of millions) planned to enhance security.  B) What was the resulting action when one of our consulates was attacked in Benghazi?

t5_2ssp3,Whoosier,1368397839,"Disability is an avenue of exploration in medieval studies not much older than a decade.  The Society for the Society for the Study of Disability in the Middle Ages was only founded 5 years ago.  That said, there are two recent books that would address your question:  Wendy J. Turner and Tory Vandeventer Pearman, eds., *The Treatment of Disabled Persons in Medieval Europe: Examining Disability in the Historical, Legal, Literary, Medical, and Religious Discourses of the Middle Ages* (2010)  Irina Metzler, *Disability in Medieval Europe: Thinking About Physical Impairment in the High Middle Ages, 1100-1400* (2006).    (Metzler also a new book just published: *A Social History of Disability in the Middle Ages: Cultural Considerations of Physical Impairment*  It’s only $125.00‼  She also has a [blog] (http://irinametzler.org/).  (Turner and Metzler just presented papers on this very subject last Thursday at the annual gathering of medievalists in Kalamazoo.  No, I didn’t hear them.)  Short of access to those books, here’s an article by M. Miles about Martin Luther’s attitude toward disabled infants that traces some of the medieval background to the early 16th-century social attitudes that he reflected: [“Martin Luther and Childhood Disability in 16th Century Germany: What did he write? What did he say?”] (http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html).  The short answer would be that disabled infants were looked upon as monstrosities, either the products of their parents’ sins, as changelings--deformed babies switched at birth by demons who carried off the healthy children, as products of spells.  I'm assuming mentally disabled children would fit this category in some way but I’m beyond my expertise when it comes to their care.  There, Turner and Metzler would be the best guides.  As for Foucault, use him cautiously.  Though his methodology significantly helped us understand the construction of social categories, when it came to reading evidence, he tended to find what he wanted to find.",‼

t5_2qyt6,akaleeroy,1368443560,"The opinion is valid, spread a little thin over too much bread, but valid. However it's disappointing that it doesn't go much into examples.   In short, it just tries to change people's perspective to view all jobs as creative (alright, ✔), but doesn't provide much in the way of alternatives to solving the question in the title.   Which is a bummer, I wanted ideas. I'm mulling this over in my own life right now. I'm faced with entering the *job market* as it's basically exiting.   The way I reckon, forces at play in the world now are crumbling the edifice of the old paradigm: overpopulation, the way money works, productivity increases through automation, dwindling supply of fossil fuel energy. I personally don't believe inventing fictional occupations for people will make much of a splash anymore either. Elephant skin de-wrinkling experts and all the plethora of people pursuing careers in shifting information around for no reason... the money system that enables them will fail sooner or later.  And so I'm trying to figure out ways to earn a living during the transition away from the failing system.  My main concern is that I don't want to hold a job and it doesn't want to hold me, so I'll end up freelancing or becoming an *entrepreneur*. A slew of considerations follow from choosing either one. My thinking is: get yourself in a position where you create something once, and it generates income more than once. Like writing a book, a classic example. Some entrepreneurship pros: you work on your own projects, using skills you already have or are eager to develop, you don't expend as much effort following orders you know are dumb. Cons: the income can fluctuate, it can take a lot of your time, and your boss is now all of the people that buy your stuff.   Another concern is reconnecting with people's needs. *Nothing useless can be truly beautiful*, said William Morris. So for me: cinematography and graphic design - better cast in the service of education, tutorials on DIY projects, (functional) clothing, making small objects (I pirated a board game). Actual things and learning to do actual things.   Another concern is having a good time. Nothing wrong with a little decoration referencing culture you care about (be it music, movies, books, thinkers).  I'm thinking, ideally... a 2-or-3-trick-pony craftsman with a storefront on the web.

That's why the defensive mastery Tough skin does not reduce damage from minions.  Ah, TIL.   &gt; MF is as much an AD caster as Cailtyn. Of course AD carries rely on their spells to complement their AA's, that's pretty much the point of having a kit as an AD carry. But saying MF is as much an AD caster as Ezreal is, imo, wrong.  Wrong in my opinion, cait could E,Q and and R some unfortunate bugger who stepped in a trap. Would they be below 50%hp? probably not. You take a Q,E,R to the face from MF and you dead son.  &gt;Having 1.8 W CD and 48 sec CD on Ulti has no impact if you don't have the damage behind. This build emphasizes utility (trough CDR and mana) over damage. Do you really think you can outdamage a Sivir going BT/PD/IE/LW ? And if you can't outdamage, then you have to do something to compensate. As I explained, Ezreal can poke and kite way more easily with the long-range Q that procs on-hit. Sivir has to get in AA range to proc something. With this build, she'll just get dashed and instakilled, imo.  But you DO have the damage behind it.   * Q = 240 + 1.1 AD * W = + 80 also AOE but will chunk the first guy you hit with sheen and slow them with frozen fist.  Say you have 300 AD, thats potentially 570 Q + 375 AA + 380 W, pretty much instantly. Add elder lizard burn to that and the passive from muramana, + 30% slow. Also you are doing damage to everyone behind them. Don't forget if you get dived, spellshield is your friend, also last item Blue ez takes a BotRK - more self peel. I don't think you can discount an AD carry build say 'well if you get dived you are fucked' because that is true for most if not all carries.  An example being, if a J4 ult an Ezreal, he presses e and /L. If a J4 ults a blue build sivir™ the Sivir has to flash pretty much. On the other hand, if a Vi ults a Ezreal, he can e all he wants.. that guy dead. Whereas Sivir, e&gt;enter&gt; /L ",™

For many of the religions of the world, you're asked to meet a few prerequisites.  These often include:  -This religion must be accepted on faith even if all evidence is against it being true -This religion is The One True Religion™ and you shall not believe in any others  Everything I have ever learned in my life contradicts these two ways of thinking.  Discarding evidence that contradicts my beliefs?  Accepting a single ""truth"" over all others when there is no solid reasoning to do so?    These are things I just cannot do if I want to be honest with myself.  The more I learned about religion, the more it seemed it was built on a foundation destined to crumble.  So what did that leave me with?  I didn't feel like I was an atheist, because it still seemed more reasonable to me that there was a god of some sort.  After stripping away all the extra layers of things that didn't make sense, deism is what was left.  That's just my experience though.  I can certainly understand if others see it differently.",™

t5_2r7ks,opportunityprofessor,1368459100,"Is the leadership hat you are wearing the best one for the situation?  Might you find more success if you changed your hat?    Hats can be a lot of fun and very useful because they allow us to change our personality by simply donning a different hat.  How fun!  I love  choices and love the right hat for the specific situation.  I have a number of hats that allow me to be functional or funky, suave and sophisticated or modern but creative.  I have the choice to wear a hat or go without.   Those that decline to wear any hat at all are missing a great opportunity to change their image with one gesture.  So what does this have to do with leadership, trends and opportunities?  We each have different mindsets that we bring to any given situation, including this blog. We can be skeptical or inquisitive, hesitant or embracing, reluctant or ambitious, bold or bewildering.  But the mindset we bring to the situation may not be the most appropriate.  What do we do then?  The obvious answer is to change hats, master a different mindset.  As a child, I wore a black cowboy hat.  I loved that hat purchased by my dad on our family vacation in Wyoming.  Unlike my brothers, who also each got a hat, I wore mine whenever I could.  I loved the way it looked and the way I felt.  In some ways, I guess it let me re-live that fun time away but also helped me envision myself in one of the many westerns I watched.  If it had not worn out, I wonder how long I would have worn it?  Over the years, I have noticed how hats have come and gone as fashion dictates.  My desire for hats has not waned but I have learned when and where to wear which hat or go without. That has been a good lesson for mastering the mindset of change.  We are currently in an explosion of technological and cultural change, transforming what we thought we knew into a wilderness of confusion.  Many today are reluctant to change, insisting on wearing that childhood hat long after it has worn out, lost its functionality or fashion appropriateness.  They pine for the way things were, the ""good old days"" that are never to return.  So they stand there, grown adults with a worn out childhood cowboy hat.  Ridiculous isn't it.  It would be funny, maybe even silly if they weren't so serious.  Imagine the incredible opportunities we could find if we would only consider a change in that  approach.  Imagine how we might see that wilderness as filled with incredible opportunities rather than a vast wasteland filled with obstacles and threats.   We will sense those opportunities to Unleash The Ultimate when we are willing to change.  We must give up our old, worn out ways of thinking and adopt something more sophisticated and yet functional.  In the end, the leadership hat we wear is our choice.  Whenever we encounter a situation, we choose which hat we will wear, which mindset we will employ.  Sure, we all get accustomed to our favorite hat and maybe even become known for wearing that particular hat or a certain style, but the hat we wear is still our choice.  The question then becomes, is it the right hat for the best opportunities?  Here are 10 questions to help you identify which hat might be more appropriate for you?  Are we willing to change our approach and learn from those that present ideas different from ours?   Are we determined to stick with the same old fashion of our thinking, determined it is right and refusing to alter our perspective?   Do we understand and appreciate what mindset of change is appropriate for different situations?   What mindset of change are you using?  How is your usual mindset working for you as a leader?  What kind of results are you getting?  Would another type of hat (mindset) work better in certain situations?  Would it help create the desired change by switching to a different mindset, a different type of hat?     If so, what hat? What are you waiting for?

t5_2qstm,coopdude,1368474618,"I'm not really sure what that means. I did forget that FICO scores in Canada are 300 to 900 instead of topping out at 850.  There are a variety of versions of the FICO score and most versions of scores sold to consumers are not FICO. Businesses demand FICO, so the Fair Isaac corporation gets their cut from Equifax/Transunion and they sell that score. Consumers don't tend to know better, so they sell a score that they made - not commonly used for lending purposes, but they make it so it's pure profit.  [From Equifax](https://help-en.equifax.ca/app/answers/detail/a_id/696): &gt;**The Equifax Credit Score™ is a proprietary credit model developed by Equifax and is calculated using the information in your Equifax credit file**. This score is intended for your own educational use.  There are numerous credit scores and models available in the marketplace and **lenders are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness**.  [And Transunion](http://www.transunion.ca/ca/personal/consumersupport/faq/score_en.page#scoreUse) &gt;Q Can I use the TransUnion Personal Credit Score to apply for credit?  &gt;A **Most lenders will access their own scoring tool**(s) to assess a consumer’s credit worthiness so they may not be interested or ask for the consumer score you have obtained online. However, you can use the TransUnion Personal Credit Score to gauge your credit worthiness for future credit applications and needs.  &gt; Is there just one type of score?  &gt;A **No, there are literally thousands of score models used in the credit industry that consider different variables for different types of credit.**  So they're giving you a score based on a model, but they're both selling you propietary scores that lenders don't tend to use that often (FICO is the most common, some lenders have in house scores, a few buy the products that the credit lenders make but the percentage is pretty small).  The scores aren't comparable, hence the huge difference - different models.",™

t5_2rd6n,Tangurena,1368485133,"Part of what made the British Empire work was that the administrators were centrally trained and then sent overseas to administer the natives. This kept a central idea of ""who we are"" going and thus the empire alive. This plan will not work when the distances exceed that of a lifetime. Even if you move the school onto a train-type structure and send the kids for years while SchoolTrain™ is moving at 70 mph (taking /u/alexanderwales upper bound of tech level speed), you're looking at maybe 1,500,000 miles for a practical upper limit (20 years at 70 mph). Select kids at age 5-6 and put them on an academic training course that sends them on the train until their mid-late 20s.    If your administrators are born locally, it won't take long before they stop giving lip service to the central state/empire and start ""going native."" Rebel provinces could get away with this sort of thing for years if they were careful.   Steam locomotives generally ran for 8 hour shifts: 8 hours running, 8 hours maintenance and 8 hours getting water back up to boiling. Diesel-electrics can run 24/7. So the ""academic"" day of SchoolTrain™ will be centered around some schedule like that. Perhaps the physical exercise part of the day would be centered around switching locomotives. ",™
t5_2qhsu,dossy,1368485145,"&gt; Sales tax &gt; &gt; If you purchase a vehicle in New Jersey, you must pay sales tax and complete the sales tax section stamped on the title. (Newly issued New Jersey titles will have a section to complete sales tax information preprinted on the document) &gt; &gt; * Typically, if you purchase a vehicle from a New Jersey dealer, the sales tax will be included in the sales process. **However, if you did not pay sales tax at the time of purchase, you will need to pay the sales tax based on the actual amount paid for the vehicle at an MVC Agency** &gt; &gt; * Some vehicles are exempt from sales tax &gt; &gt; For your convenience, MVC accepts American Express® card, MasterCard® card, Visa® card, checks, money orders and cash.  Source: [NJ DMV website](http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Vehicle/MotorVehicles.htm)  So, while the dealer could collect sales tax on the sale (and probably should be), the DMV absolutely does collect sales tax if it wasn't included in the sales process, per their website.  Perhaps you can print out that webpage and bring it and ask them why it says you will need to pay any uncollected sales tax at an MVC agency, if they're saying the dealer is wrong?",®

t5_2t659,Kode47,1368492130,"Skipping the ooc.   I was ""born Buddhist"", but since no one in my family takes religion that seriously, it was never a big part of my life. Now I'm more or less atheist/agnostic, but I do remember a time when I was a certified faith-smasher™ a couple of years ago. That changed after I read an article by the Bad Astronomer Phil Bait, basically his point was that the greatest threat to secular thinking these days is militant atheists who are assholes to everyone else. He said something like ""what we need now are diplomats, not soldiers"" (professional quote, i know), and that struck me quite well. So I handed in my quote-maker badge, and revoked my faith-smashing licence, and tried to become what a good atheist should be.   I still browse r/atheism, partly to look for material to post here but also because if you look at it as a counterpart to those religious facebook pages, it really isn't that bad. But whenever I start getting used to /r/atheism, they also surprise me with a post so smug and conceited, that I'm just thrown out of the whole thing, like the one where some guy harassed a girl for thanking god in helping her grandpa recover from cancer. That just made me really sad about the whole sub, but overall it's an ok place.   As for actual religion, I couldn't care less about what someone's personal beliefs are. The only ""atheist issues"" I care about are things involving freedom of religion and teaching creationism in schools, which I honestly think should not happen. But I'm not going to go on tirades over it, though I'm a bit concerned that while making fun of ""oppressed atheists"" that we shouldn't feel bad for the ""oppressed Christians"". I just think extremists on both sides (of any issue, really) deserve to be ridiculed.    ",™

Don't sacrifice everything in the name of good sleep, but pick things you actually CAN do.  For example, the bluish light given off by most screens is pretty good at keeping you awake; the ""ideal"" recommendation might be to say ""no computer or TV after 10"".  But if you get home late from work and want to watch a movie to unwind, then the cost of sticking to that rule might be something you're not willing to bear; a better rule might be ""turn out the lights and dim the monitor after 10"", since - while it's not The Perfect Method™, it *will* be easier for you to actually stick to.

t5_2qh8m,H3g3m0n,1368509830,"&gt; It's just simply not human anymore. And neither are companies (other than legally ☹).  Companies will do whatever the fuck they can get away with if it will turn a profit. If you legalized assassination they would popup over night, and not small operations but spinoffs of the large security firms and private intelligence agencies.  Remember a percentage of the population are sociopaths. Lack empathy. Or will come up with reasons as to why it's for the best ""If we don't do it, someone else will and they will do worse."" or ""It's the only way to keep progress going."". Basically any argument for freemarkets pro extreme capitalism. The problem is the system rewards them for their behaviour, you increased profits heres a promotion. Other people will just do what they are told.  This also assumes that companies are even run by people in the future. It's possible we could see a hybridization of AI and corporations. Basically all the executive decisions are done by AGI to meat some fitness function. If we keep using current practices then that fitness function will be maximum profit.  Unless society as a whole is setup for the well being of the human race rather than profit, growth, productivity, efficiency.  It is also a rather hard to define concept, is well being maximum happiness in which case the best way is to embed a chip into your brain to stimulate your pleasure centers. Productivity? in which case you get slaves (or possible kill all the organics are replace them with robots). Let the individual human do what they want, make them a god in a VR simulation? Scan in a large sample of the human population, analyse their brains to find what answer they would come up with if they where smarter and well educated and use that. Do we perhaps augment people with an AI but keep their core brain as the primary, kind of like an extra subconscious part of the brain that suggests things based on knowing what you would want if you had access to the entire of human knowledge like it was your local memory, where many times smarter and was an expert in every field in existence.   'Human' is also be a hard to define concept too. How much genetic manipulation can I do before I'm not human? Does it matter if I don't modify my brain but do everything else? What happens if I upload my brain into a computer simulation? What happens if I mate 10000 cloned forks of my mind. Or replace some of my neurons with artificial ones. Or add so much augmentation that my meat brain is a tiny potion that is slow and inefficient resulting in most of it to basically die of from lack of use and the rest to be little more than basic input/output to my meat body.  Do we go with sentient well being? What happens if we design custom AIs that have radically different (perhaps nonsensicle) desires. Or no desires.",☹

t5_2qhbp,omdufro,1368527246,"Lol way to reinforce my point about context by doing your utmost to give my comments none whatsoever.  I suppose you could've looked at what I actually said - yes, the whole comment... what a concept! - but since that's apparently not an option, let me rephrase it as simply as I can:  **As a Muslim, if the Qur'an says one thing but a scholar and/or the hadith say another *contradictory* thing, you must choose the Qur'an, given what Muslim theology and the Qur'an itself claim that it is.**  Here's the problem, though: Almost no one follows this simple principle. What actually happens is that in choosing to adhere to the Qur'an even if it goes against - read: ""supersedes by its very nature in addition to just plain making more sense than"" other sources of so-called authority, many people are mocked, threatened, and /or labeled apostates and enemies of Islam. As I said up above, at this point, they are, for all intents and purposes, a non-believer in the eyes of ""legitimate Islam™"". Why? Is that not an indication to you that something is broken? It's not ok, but a lot of the shit that gets heaped onto Islam and Muslims could be avoided if they just used a little brain power. Sadly, independent thought is not encouraged in a lot of the Muslim world, which is actually in stark contrast to how things have historically operated.   Speaking of which, as for the non-persecution and prosecution of the folks over at r/ex-Muslim, let me ask you a question: If you dropped these people off in a country like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or one of the various African nations run in a similar fashion (assuming that they live in the West at the moment), how long do you think they would be allowed their open dissent, or even assured of their survival?   I mean, just look around! Riots break out over drawings of Muhammad. Girls are shot and doused with acid for - and I know this is horrific, so brace yourself! - daring to go to school. People blow themselves up with the express intent of killing as many people as possible because they think it'll make them a martyr, and when justification for such a thing is rightly demanded, you can't listen for 30 seconds without hearing ""Well, such-and-such hadith says..."" or ""So-and-So McScholar says..."" Never mind that disregarding the Qur'an in favor of something that blatantly contradicts it is itself a sin for a Muslim, and that anyone with the Internet can produce a list of contradictory and just plain stupid hadith as long as my arm... trifles!   More distressing still is the fact that 99% of the time, no mention of the Qur'an is made in such cases. Would you like to know why? Because there's no support for such barbarism in its pages. I guess it's only worth reading when you need it as support in crying religious bigotry, huh?  Anyway, this has gone on for much longer than I intended, but this kind of stuff pisses me off. Religion is not an excuse or a permission slip to shut off your brain, and no god, Allah included, will ask you to if they're legit.  I hope this helps clarify things. Have a good day, everybody.

[It doesn't take long](http://manboobz.com/2013/01/26/a-voice-for-men-well-support-women-in-combat-only-if-the-proper-percentage-of-women-get-killed/) to find [various feminists](http://community.feministing.com/2013/01/30/white-house-petition-asks-that-women-be-required-to-register-for-selective-service/) who will give you their insights on this issue.  &gt;And yet, the vast majority of the accusers are female.  So what?  &gt;You'd think that as RealFeminists™ they'd be fighting that stereotype. Must be that pervasive patriarchy again!  The stereotype is being helped kept alive whenever people sexualize teens, which happens quite frequently here on Reddit. Anyway,  I'm a teacher and probably hate the stereotype more than most, so I definitely agree with trying to fight it, but that also means an end to [this kind of shit from MRAs and such.](http://manboobz.com/2013/05/12/female-mra-argues-that-the-real-abusers-in-the-bbc-pedo-scandals-were-the-underage-girls/#more-8639)  &gt;A few years ago, there was this huge outcry about women getting injured in the workplace, and how we need to step up as a nation now to fix this problem. When, in actuality, the same number of women were being injured as before, but the percentage was higher... because more men were out of work, and making the figure look larger by comparison. Another manufactured controversy brought to you by RealFeminism™.  I don't even remember what you're talking about.  &gt;TL;DR - People actually understand what you call RealFeminism™, which is why there's a MRM in the first place.  Nah, it's just a reactionary group for the most part.",™

""Granite is a very good conductor of electricity."" ... right  Here is a [conductivity chart for various materials.](http://www.eos.ubc.ca/ubcgif/iag/foundations/properties/resistivity_files/res-range-clr.jpg)  Granite is an igneous rock. let's give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that granite is the most conductive. So it has a resistance of 1000 Ohm.metre. If this doesn't mean much to you, just look at the relative conductivity or resistivity.  Salt water is between 0.2 and 1 Ohm.metre, graphite is 0.1 Ohm.metre to 10 Ohm.metre. By intuition (and high school science), you know that graphite and salt water are both fairly conductive.   So the *least* conductive graphite is still 100x times more conductive than granite. 10 Ohm.m versus 1000 Ohm.m  Gravel and sand is more conductive than granite. I'm sure if I asked the average person in the street if salt-water was more or less conductive than gravel or sand, that they would say ""salt water"".

t5_2snuc,ihaveallama,1368545168,"&gt; But the word implies doesn't mean that Q will obtain necessarily.  If P -&gt; ◻Q applied to any real scenario, then P obtaining in a possible world would result in Q obtaining in every possible world. But I'm not saying Q obtains in every possible world -- just that Q obtains in every possible world that P also obtains in. That's captured by P -&gt; Q.   &gt; Rain doesn't imply wetness?  Not sure what you're going for. If you have rain, but you don't have wetness, then rain doesn't imply wetness.  &gt; It means set theory would not be true in that possible world, and if there is such a possible world, then it is not necessarily true that set theory is true.  It would be true that there is nothing in reality that forms a model for a sufficient portion of set theory for us to care about set theory. As a result, we probably wouldn't come up with set theory.  But tautologically, if we *did* come up with set theory and if we *defined* its axioms to be true then the results would also be true. The fact that we additionally can then apply its conclusions to the real world is a matter of set theory's usefulness, not its truth.  EDIT: We are likely using two different definitions of ""true"". Would you say that by certain math/logic being ""true"", you mean that ""it somewhat reliably approximates at least one phenomenon of reality""? If that is your definition, then I agree that in a white backdrop world, set theory is no longer ""true"".",◻

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1368550131,"&gt;###Developer Blogs ## Welcome to Game Update 2.1: Customization 05.14.2013  &gt;Howdy from Austin, Texas! We are thrilled to release Game Update 2.1: Customization today. This update introduces many highly requested and anticipated features to Star Wars™: The Old Republic™. As the name indicates, Game Update 2.1 is all about giving players the freedom to customize their characters to fully immerse themselves in their personal Star Wars™ saga.  &gt;What types of customization and convenience options are now available for purchase, you ask? Well, players will be able to change their Character, Legacy, and Guild names with new Cartel Market consumables. And if your character’s look doesn’t quite match their new name, then swing by one of the Appearance Designer Kiosks located on both Fleets and Capital Worlds and adjust almost anything about your character’s image. This includes body type, face, scars, tattoos, hair style, eye, hair, and skin color. You can even change your character’s species! For a completely fresh look, I would suggest trying out our brand new species, the Cathar! Subscribers can expect a permanent discount on these items.  &gt;Game Update 2.1 also introduces Dye Modules, which can be purchased as consumables on the Cartel Market, with in-game credits at the Security and Collector’s Edition vendors, as well as through crafting. With our new Dye Mods you’ll be able to recolor almost any piece of gear in The Old Republic. You can mix and match colors on each individual piece of gear, or you can choose to Unify Color for a more classic look.  &gt;One of our new convenience features we are especially excited about is the Collections Interface. Collections will allow players to unlock almost any Cartel Market item, and some special promotion items, on an account-wide level for a discounted price. An added benefit of this new interface is that you can free up some Cargo or Inventory space by simply destroying any item you have unlocked on that character and then just transferring a copy of that item to your inventory as needed.  &gt;As with all new features, you can definitely expect us to keep adding options for Dye Mods, the Appearance Designer Kiosks, and Collections. Game Update 2.1: Customization is unique in that it is almost entirely comprised of player-requested additions. Keep the feedback coming -- we’re listening.  &gt;Until next time, see you in-game!  &gt;Cory Butler   &gt;Producer",™

t5_2ulfu,ThatsWhatUrMomSaid,1368559865,"Well, actually...  From [the USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp#_Toc275426680):  ###Must I register my trademark?   No. You can establish rights in a mark based on use of the mark in commerce, without a registration. However, owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several important benefits.  ###What are the benefits of federal trademark registration?   Owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several advantages, including:  * Public notice of your claim of ownership of the mark; * A legal presumption of your ownership of the mark and your exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the registration; * The ability to bring an action concerning the mark in federal court; * The use of the U.S. registration as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries; * The ability to record the U.S. registration with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Service to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods; * The right to use the federal registration symbol ®; and * Listing in the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s online databases.  ###Do federal regulations govern the use of the designations ""TM"" or ""SM"" or the ® symbol?   If you claim rights to use a mark, you may use the ""TM"" (trademark) or ""SM"" (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim of a “common-law” mark.  No registration is necessary to use a ""TM"" or ""SM"" symbol and you may continue to use these symbols even if the USPTO refuses to register your mark.  Those symbols put people on notice that you claim rights in the mark, although common law doesn't give you all the rights and benefits of federal registration.   You may only use the federal registration symbol ""®"" after the USPTO actually registers a mark, not while an application is pending.",®

t5_2ryqe,patrickbrianmooney,1368564495,"Hi there. I was in the same position as you a while ago. I've always loved reading but hated the stuff that my high school teachers were trying to cram down my throat. I remember turning in book reports in eighth grade on Stephen King or David Eddings and getting poor grades and written comments that I should Elevate My Sights and read some Quality Literature™.  I kept reading sci-fi, fantasy, and horror anyway, because I liked it. I consciously avoided anything that was labeled as a ""classic."" Then my grandmother nagged me into reading *Crime and Punishment* my freshman year in college, and I was hooked. I changed my major to English the next quarter. Now I have an M.A. in English and I'm working on my Ph.D.  One thing I can say in that connection is that serious literary critics don't put much stock in the ""high literature""/""popular culture"" distinction any more -- it's been pretty well demolished over the last forty years or so. It's second-raters who try to bolster their lack of understanding by retreating into snobbiness. Anyone who understands this particular discipline understands that the line between those categories is so fuzzy that it doesn't exist.   In [the first class I taught as instructor of record](http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/ta/s12/eng104a/syllabus.html), I put a Stephen King novel on the syllabus. Not one person in my department complained, and the students loved it, because it's a good fucking novel. This summer, I'm teaching [a course on science fiction](http://patrickbrianmooney.nfshost.com/~patrick/ta/s12/eng104a/syllabus.html), by the way.  You should read what you want to read, and read it because it gives you pleasure. At the same time, be open to new things, and try to ignore how pretentious snobs label books. Appreciate each work on its own terms, but don't feel like you're obligated to like it.  Canonical authors that I hate happen to include Walt Whitman, William Langland, and Stephen Crane. I happen to like *The Road*, but am not under the impression that that means you should like it.  Read what gives you pleasure. Engage yourself with it and interrogate it critically. Read it because you like it and it gives you opportunities to think.  Things I suspect you might like, based on /u/satanspanties's perceptive hypothesis that you like character-driven novels, include the more popular works of Tolkien (as Satanspanties suggested), the Niel Gaiman suggested by /u/punicagrantum, David Eddings's Belgariad series, Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy (it gets weaker as it goes on, though), David Brin's *The Postman* (the Kevin Costner movie adaptation was absolute crap, by the way).  For Elevated Literature, based on your tastes, I might recommend Kurt Vonnegut (give *Slaughterhouse-Five* a pass, even though everyone other than me seems to love it, and read *Galopogos*) and Philip Roth (start with *The Human Stain*).  Read what you like, because it gives you pleasure and the opportunity to think. Don't worry about what other people think.",™

t5_2rk3b,xxVb,1368567484,"Another option is that the game randomly creates a One True Religion™, and you're just gonna have to figure which one it is before the world dramatically ends... Unless that religion doesn't have a devastating world end, in which case it plays out more like a normal civ game.  You get points for good (as defined by that religion's god/gods) things you've done for the world, and for the number of followers in your civ. There could be miracles, but there could be plenty of false reports, superstition, total fakes, and actually supernatural but ""demonic"" fakes.  (while on the topic of good as defined by a deity, the Ilwrath have a good one... I mean evil... I, uh...)  Rule the world? Convert the world? Kill the infidels? Care for the poor? Peace and happiness? Our peace or you die? Swords into plowshares? Plowshares into swords? Law for the people? People for the law?  Splitting the religion into multiple separate churches (whether at Judaism-Christianity-Islam, or within any of those, eg Sunni-Shia) with different civs having different takes on the religion... with different effects and varying amounts of ""goodness"" points.  I think it's a better idea than any implementation of it could achieve, but I'd love to work on something like this (too bad I don't know how). It'd need a few new things to get things working, but I think it's doable, and could create a bit of a mystery to the game, something to figure out each game.  But the main problem might be that if you believe in a One True Religion™, you might be bothered by how the game represents it, or how it represents the world (well, *a* world) as having a different god.

Here's more info if you're curious:  The Praxis III® exam is a test that licensing bodies use to determine teacher readiness for full certification in certain states. It is administered to beginning teachers (often those teaching under a provisional or temporary teaching license) to assess their classroom practice techniques and teaching skills.  A decidedly more flexible teaching exam than any of the other Praxis tests, the Praxis III® utilizes trained assessors to interview teachers and monitor in-class teaching and other professional duties. Assessors measure 19 criteria that fit into the following categories:  Classroom environment  Lesson plans  Instruction  Professionalism",®

t5_2ryd5,SnRipper,1368597437,"You're right, if God was there He would have taken justice. In fact, if God was in the world right now, there would be no evil and justice would reign. If God was here, it would be a perfect world without evil and crime. It would be heaven.  Jesus will come back again as a King and delivers judgement on those who are wicked. For now, Satan is allowed to run loose on the earth and men are allow to commit horrendous act according to their evil desire. But there WILL be a final judgement for ALL (including those who have passed i.e. Hitler).  Does this mean, God doesn't care and give a shit about what's going on? Of course not. His heart breaks when ours shatter.  New International Version (©2011) ""For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet he did not sin."" There are many Christians that have been raped, denied justice, born without limbs, etc... and they all can still thank God for what happens.   I like to call these guys wounded healers. Without first being wounded, they cannot understand and know how to heal a certain wound of another person. They cannot empathize with the wounded. I believe God use these individuals to reach out to those who have been a victim of this fallen world and share God's love to the victims. ",©

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1368610661,"  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.

t5_mouw,stop-chemistry-time,1368624142,"&gt;I need help to get my mind around the issues, the failure of the mining plan to allow this process, excellent reasons why studies have proven this method an environmental disaster. Any pointers, help is going to be greatly appreciated.  I don't think that argument is fair. I'm a chemist and will try to explain and discuss some parts of this, but I must be clear that this is informal commentary. You'll need to back up anything I say here with other sources, because I accept no liability for your use of what I say - I'm not an expert on this type of process.  Firstly, the document you've offered is ugly, but let's ignore that! Shame you can't sue people for bad formatting.  Concerningly, on page 21, test results for the arsenic toxicity assay are missing.  I don't think I could be convinced that this process is inherently unsafe. The document suggests that it has been designed with a high level of regulatory compliance in mind - i.e. it's designed to be a very contained system with close attention paid to management of waste streams.  The problem seems to be that some solution from some part of the process has been somehow discharged onto your client's land.  If this is true, then it seems concerning, since ""spray of solution onto uncontrolled areas"" is not part of the waste-disposal strategy in the document! The challenge is being sure which part of the process it came from - from what you've said I suspect it could be part of the solution after the BIOX^® phase.  In the BIOX^® phase, as you rightly describe, it seems to be the case that a mixture of bacteria are used to oxidise certain components of the crude process mixture. In particular, iron and sulfur.   A very brief read of the paper you linked suggests to me that the BIOX^® process runs at a low pH (ie high acidity) and that upon neutralisation in a later stage (adding basic/alkaline lime), stable arsenic residues precipitate (as solids) and can be separated and managed.  If the spray into your client's land was before the neutralisation, I would be concerned about arsenic content. If after neutralisation (ie discharge/spray from the CIL residue storage tank) it would probably be relatively inert, but still should not be subject to uncontrolled discharge.  Get the test results and see what they tell you, but be aware that even if they show arsenic content it may be necessary to prove that the arsenic was in a harmful form, or could be biodegraded into such. In other words, not all forms of toxic elements are bad, and different combinations can be worse than others.  Good luck, if you have more questions that you think I can help with, send me an inbox message. Equally I can try to explain general ideas more clearly, but it may take me a few days to get back to you.",®

t5_2qh35,kiwipete,1368627910,"Quite right. Homoiconicity is really the power there. Presumably M-exprs (though I have no experience with those) have exactly the same benefits. Perhaps I've grown to have an aesthetic appreciation for all those parentheses giving my code a nice big, warm hug.  For example, the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/), which has been excitedly followed by many in the scientific community, looks to have very bland Python-esque syntax. However, they claim to be fully homoiconic and supporting of macros. From what I've read, the designers are trying to make the language as lispy as they think they can get away with.  I don't immediately see where Wheeler's notation is trivially equivalent to s-exprs, however, that is almost certainly a function of my lisp naiveté rather than anything grounded in expertise.

t5_2qtwb,SapphireBlueberry,1368629519,"&gt;At the end of the day if I do it it will be for her. If she doesn't do it it will be for me.   Bzzzzzttt wrong. These two statements seem equal, but they're not. Do you know why? I'll give you a hint: One of them involves someone other than the two of you.  I'm sure you and everyone else reading my reply knows this, but it's the first statement. You're right in that if she doesn't have kids, it will be for you, and the only two people that impacts, is you, and your girlfriend.  Do not have a child for another person if you do not want children. Now that I am in my thirties and I know more people who are also in their thirties and are struggling with this sort of thing, it has become even more ridiculously stupid to me that someone would do this than it ever was before.   Despite the rhetoric, you're not giving that person a gift that will make them happy, because a child is not a gift. As in, it's not an item with the purpose of ensuring someone else's happiness. It is another human being. An entirely separate, independent, autonomous human being. No child deserves to be wanted by both its parents anything less than 100%. And remember, no one asks to be born.  I have yet to see this Hugh Grantesque rom-com Hollywood ending with anyone I know (mostly men) where they do a 180 and ""immediately fall in love"" with their kid and are SO glad they did it and they become father of the year. Know why? Because this is terrible fucking logic.   Ask yourself, why are they having the kid? So they can hang on to the woman who is the mother, right? They don't really want the kid or kids, they want to stay with the woman they love. Well, the woman they love is not going to be the same person after she has a kid. I mean, even the baby commercials tell you that - ""A baby changes everything."" She's now a mother. And remember, ""being a mom is a full time job!™"" It's ""the most important job in the world!™"" Her attention is going to be divided between you and this other person you brought into your home and your relationship, but mostly the other person, for a long time, since the other person is entirely dependent on her.  So now the woman you love is not the same woman you wanted to be with before the kid you didn't want came into your lives. It doesn't go down like in the movies. The reality is anything from an emotionally distant father and husband whose lack of interest in the child has a dramatic impact on the kid, to possible abuse in various forms, to divorce.  Unless *you* actually *want* a kid, do not do it. It is not fair to anyone involved.",™

She's got everything except a heal, and at early levels she can pretty much 1v1 almost any AD, and in short trades she comes on top every time.  She can be a bit tricky to play but once you get used to her, she's fantastic.  She is quite popular but nowhere near the level of Thresh or Taric.

I never was the academic type, I studied art and drama at school/college ( super jobless paths) and eventually found a job working as a dental nurse ( no training required ) it was ""ok"" paid some bills, but nothing to jump out of bed for. So anyway long story short I did the dental nurse thing till I got married and then went on maternity leave, I discovered online gaming and 3D worlds, I found a site (imvu.com) where you could create and sell items, having studied art and graphics I took to this like a duck to water. It took a few years to get any steady cash rolling, but now my son is turning 7 and I am still earning a steady income from online creative endeavours!.

t5_2qqd4,SentientTorus,1368643156,"Everyone is siding very heavily with the guard, but I think we need to take a lesson from history on how concentration of military power works. 2 tanks next to each other is in fact far better than 2 tanks a hundred miles apart. And 4 tanks is even better. In fact, if you concentrated all your tanks into one or two places, you'd have *overwhelming* tank superiority and be able to run roughshod over your enemy's army until he got the idea and started concentrating his tanks too.  Thus, if the Space Marines are able to survive the initial assaults on their core worlds? Overwhelming Marine victory. The Imperium cannot match the concentration of force a marine company can bring to bear, which means almost no Imperial Guard general, or supply depot, or forge world would be safe. The Imperial Guard's entire infrastructure would be crumbling around its ears while its armies were being sent off to fight battles the space marines had won and moved on from months ago.  Though this requires Space Marines to adopt downright Eldar-y tactics of hit and run and exploiting the enemy's strategic weak-points, rather than the Simple Manly Combat™ the marines usually favor. So I guess it really depends who's leading the marines, and if they're willing to be a bit flexible. ",™

(If you're drowning in debt and still justifying it, that's another thing, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.)  On another note: be careful with individual stocks vs. index funds.  Investing in individual stocks responsibly requires a lot more commitment and research.  If you're not doing due diligence, they may end up falling more into entertainment than investment.  (If you know this already, then great! You can ignore the rest.)

t5_2r090,RobbyRas,1368660340,"New Press Release from LGC  Full release below (photos if you click through)  LA GLORIA CUBANA TO LAUNCH ITS FIRST NICARAGUAN CIGARS   La Gloria Cubana® is making a bold departure from its Dominican roots with the launch of two new Nicaraguan collections, the first-ever La Glorias to have Nicaragua as the country of origin. Both expressions will mark the expansion of the top-selling Serie R line which started the large ring, full flavor craze back in 1999.   According to Michael Giannini, General Cigar’s director of innovation, “When Serie R debuted, we established a market for bold cigars, and inspired other manufacturers to follow suit. We’re shaking things up again, by further expanding the size and flavor spectrum of our cigars with two unique and different full-flavored Nicaraguan blends, each in ultra-large ring gauges. Both new collections are trend setters in the making.”   The first of the two new Nicaraguan collections is a puro called Serie R Black. The blend features viso leaves from Jalapa and Esteli, and a Jalapa viso binder. The use of Jalapa viso as a binder and in the blend speaks to the spectacular characteristics of this tobacco, which was cultivated by a small, independent grower named Pedro Joaquin Guardian. It was Pedro who took a bold step by raising the tobacco on several small, unconnected plots on the craggy Jalapa mountainside. The blend is punctuated with an audacious Jalapa ligero wrapper. Harvested from the 2009 crop, this flavorful tobacco was fermented for an entire year, and aged for two and a half years.    Serie R Black debuts with a trio of brawny frontmarks, each in 18-count boxes. This includes: No 58 (6.87” x 58, SRP $6.99); No 60 (6” x 60, SRP $7.24) and No 64 (6.25” x 64, SRP $7.49). This collection will only be available for purchase through Internet/catalog retailers.   Initial details about the second Serie R offering will be released in June, with a full reveal in July at the IPCPR trade show in Las Vegas. This new line will be a brick and mortar exclusive.   Giannini noted, “What’s also significant about both new blends is that they have the full flavor that’s characteristic of Nicaraguan tobacco, but they’re not about power. They are meant to deliver the smoking experience of a well-aged, refined and balanced Nicaraguan smoke, and we believe we’re delivering that in spades.” ",®

t5_2qrct,karatechopgeo,1368661559,"It's a nicely constructed logo, but it doesn't look like a band logo. Looking at band logos from the era you mentioned, it's all about the typeface. If there are any elements of an image, they interact directly with the type, never taking away from it. The subtle displacement of the letters in the Beatles logo resting on the 4th beat, the ♂ in the Who, the sexy feet on the Kinks, it's usually nothing more than an element, and that's all you need as the word meaning does the rest. You've got a bit of a lucky hand here because the two main letters you can focus on are 'C', which lend themselves to a cog very well. Why not just have the outside of each 'C' running with the gears of the cogs, no more no less? I'd also suggest looking at another font, the construction of this one is very open and spacey. That doesn't sound like rock and/or roll to me. At the very least bring it all closer together.  I'd suggest just getting a few sheets of paper and going crazy with what you can do using nothing more than a pen, stepping away from computers and layers and letting your imagination go a bit. Once you've got something, even if it's just a sketch, it'll look a lot better replicating it rather than trying to birth it digitally.",♂

t5_2qiel,DildoChrist,1368662366,"I don't know, isn't that basically how it works, though? I don't think it's unfair to call it a circlejerk because that's exactly what reddit circlejerks are.  Basically, I think I disagree with you on there being a difference between ""circlejerk hivemind"" and ""*genuine* dislike"" I mean, it's not like the people participating in any of the various circlejerks on reddit are consciously like ""Oh let's circlejerk about this!"", they actively believe the things they're celebrating, or they actively dislike the things they're all piling on to. It's not that the participants or opinions in a circlejerk (although I am getting so tired of this word) are disingenuous or dishonest at all - it's just an echo chamber.  Let me put it this way: If plenty of people dislike the Canucks because of diving, all the comments insulting them get upvoted and all the comments defending them get downvoted. What you end up with is just the repetition of the same opinions over and over. That doesn't mean the people don't believe what they're saying, it just means that contrary opinions are going to be drowned out. That's the "" circlejerk**™** ""  That's what whatbomb was talking about (afaik) and that's what I was talking about with regards to Canucks and Coyotes fans in this thread.

The challenge is being sure which part of the process it came from - from what you've said I suspect it could be part of the solution after the BIOX® phase""  100% correct ! Well done.  The mine on google maps is here: https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=fosterville+gold+mine&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=CxyUUczvNcTzlAWhwYC4BQ&amp;ved=0CAsQ_AUoAg  Photos of the BIOX processing at that google maps location is here: http://www.goldfieldsbioxonline.co.za/biox/gallery.html (but you need to scroll to photos starting at ""31/57"" and there is about 10 photos).  However, looking at the google maps, about 1 kilometer north, is a huge dam: https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=-36.685499,+144.503936&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=-32.010396,135.119128&amp;sspn=74.315063,173.144531&amp;t=h&amp;z=16  The liquid in this dam, is what is being sprayed onto a ""drying out hill area"" 100 meters north of the dam, and it is this spray that is ""airborne and floating onto my clients land"".  The trees died off, animals have possibly been exposed to either wet spray (which is the recent big spray incident) or dry spray (when the mine turns off the wet spray to let the sprayed hill area dry).  Now i need to organize testing of the riverways, mud in the bottom of the dams and animal biology, to see what effect the ""spray liquid"" is having, what concentrations of arsenic are building up.  I have a chemical analysis from soil samples from my clients land - prepared by and for the miners, but it doesn't address long term build up (samples didn't look at bottom of dam mud, riverways etc) as the rain and water run off ""pooling up"" concentrated amounts of whatever is in the spray.  So, i have the ""test results"" of selective soil samples (basically where the trees visibly died), but not the areas i think build up would likely have occurred, only the ""burnt tree's and burnt land soil and vegetation samples"".  What should i be looking for in terms of harmful ""arsenic content"" in the reports, i'll put up what it contains.  Don't worry, i can't use reddit as evidence in these proceedings :) This is to ameliorate my almost total ignorance of what i need to know about this chemistry. No need to worry about what you tell me, can't be used ...but it will educate myself and the client.",®

From 2013 to 2037 it makes a jump (this is likely due to the hyper exponential singularity process..).

But it would be awesome if you and djWHEAT covered some more Dota. I'm not sure if anyone of you is playing the game, and if not then I can see how it doesn't make much sense to talk about it more. But it's still sad, such an amazing game :)  I'd been a big fan of djWHEAT before the Starcraft 2 days and I was psyched when he got into Starcraft and dedicated pretty much all of his output to it (although I do miss [Epileptic Gaming](http://blip.tv/519archive) which was put aside somewhere along the way).  Unfortunately after 2 years I kind of lost interest in Starcraft and switched all my efforts towards Dota. The game itself is awesome, the community for the biggest part as well, and nowadays the production value of streams is pretty up to par too.  But imho one big thing missing from Dota compared to Starcraft is a real personality, a professional and witty entertainer. Yes, there's a few good Dota ""talkers"" out there, but so far I have not found one comparable to The Big Four™:  Day[9], Tasteless, Artosis and djWHEAT  These guys have the right mix of being professional, natural, funny and emotional. I payed for GSL just to watch Tastosis ramble about random stuff or make jokes about units ingame, even if the game was bad I still had fun.

t5_2qore,Baron_Tartarus,1368683105,"&gt;I think most people are hoping for a ladder system with no AH.  This is exactly what i want. Blizzard would never do it because or RMAH, but really, truly, just a mode of game where maybe i can just trade between my own characters and no AH would be fun.    ** My big NO auction house idea**: For the No Auction house idea i think two things would make it fun. Not being able to 'public trade, meaning strangers, and through the AH, but still be able to trade with friends. Here's how i think each could be done:   **No Auction house**  The no AH one is obvious. A lot of us want to play without the AH. Some might say ""why not just not use it"". Well if hardcore didn't exist would you play standard diablo like normal and have the discipline to delete your toon after every death? Unlikely. So as someone wanting a no AH mode, i need it to be as enforced through the game as hardcore is with your characters dying.   To me it would bring back the excitement of almost every single legendary drop; Things are no longer infinitely common; Find a perfect stormshield? awesome, put it on the side for your barb you're trying to do harder MPs with. Find a half decent SOJ? awesome, now your toons all have the option of more dmg vs elites.   **Trading with friends?**  I know Blizzard might say ""if we allow that, then everyone will just go to forum threads, and be forced to trade RealIDs™ to strangers to alleviate the lack of an AH. A fix for that could be that you choose like say... 10 friends you want to share your drops with. Any items found before you added them to your share list, you can't trade with them. However, any items found after adding the friend to your share list, you can trade with. That also preserves the excitement of getting a drop and ""oh wow, ""XXXYOLOSWAG430CODXXX, my very best friend would be so happy to have this for his wizard stuck in MP3!"" and you can do that! you can live that reality! Just add them to your share list and anything that drops, you can share back and forth.  Anyway, that's my great idea for the ""NO Auction House Mode"". The share list could be considered arguably complicated, but perhaps this mode unlocks after beating D3, so it isn't too much info for the absolute newb?  :)    [edit] as was entirely expected people are saying ""why not just do that, why do you need a 'mode"". Well,  If hardcore didn't exist would you have the discipline to delete your toon after every death? ",™

t5_2qh0n,Faggot_Fredrikson,1368693636,"I can think of two general paths that you might end up with these sorts of results (statements in the form of *""for all sufficiently large n in N""*).  **#1**  Probabilistic statement about the natural numbers with uncertainty decreasing as n gets larger. With sufficiently large n, the uncertainty limits down to ""integer certainty"", meaning that the uncertainty becomes sort of virtual, it's continuous nature hidden behind the discrete filter of the integers, if that makes any sense.  Basically, you have probabilistic statement such as this: ""We are trying to figure out what f(n) is like. We have this similar but a somewhat probabilistic function d(n) = f(n) + floor(u(n)), where floor(u(n)) rounds any real number down to the nearest integer, and u(n) is the uncertainty term giving the function it's probabilistic nature. f(n) we do not understand yet, but d(n) we can work with. We can show that u(n) goes asymptotically towards zero, and for every sufficiently large n, floor(u(n)) = 0, and then we have d(n) = f(n). Now, since we know how to deal with d(n), we can finally start to make some statements about f(n), our function of interest. We prove results about f(n), but only for all sufficiently large n, and leave the lesser n as an exercise for the future generations.""  **#2**  Rigorous constructive existence statements. Possibly using comp-sci methods, like modeling the problem as a Turing machine or even using Gödel numberings. We are trying to get results in the form of ""X is true for all n in N"", but we don't know how to do it yet, so we start with ""there exists x in N such that X is true for x"". First we might try the usual proof by contradiction approach, but we might be getting nowhere with it. Gotta get out the big guns, intuitive construction, starting from the axioms, building the definitions rigorously with set theoretic formal vocabulary, and then keep adding logical Lego™-blocks until we have an existence statement. The existence statement constructed in this way can get pretty unwieldy and only give us a way to construct some gigantically huge numbers for which X is true.  These sorts of constructive methods, or intuitionistic logic, are not as powerful and expressive as the logic and methods most of modern math is allowed to use. The constructive methods are however sometimes easier to reason with, and more effective in the sense that at least you can make some progress, even if you can't get everything done with a single swooping super-elegant math-poetry stroke. Often you can set a computer down to investigate and calculate parts of your constructive proof.  Basically, the numbers are sometimes (not always) huge in results derived with these sorts of methods, because the arguments to derive them are them-selves huge and complicated. That's perhaps a silly statement, and not saying much, but yeah...  The really beautiful theorems often provide novel insights and genius mind-bending twists, such that no computer search by purely constructive formal methods could ever have figured it out. The formal constructive method for searching the desired theorem from the space of all mathematical statements can be algorithmically simpler to set up and launch. Adding all the allowed tools a modern mathematician has at his disposal to the search for theorems makes the algorithm run into uncountable dead-ends, and thus only the divine insight of a genius human being can safely wield those powerful tools without going insane by losing himself in infinite loops.  These genius novel twists sometimes break tensions built up by generations of constructionist brute-force theorem proving mathematicians, giving the mathematical community a long awaited, huge orgasmic release of joy and wisdom.",™

Spock was *already* breaking the Prime Directive in the first place while telling Kirk not to break the [Prime Directive](http://files.showbizafrica.net/200009701-42b7243a93/xbit.jpg). And the submarine bit reminded me of one of my favourite lines from Futurama:  ""How many atmospheres can the ship survive?""   ""Well, it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.""  The rest. Well, I enjoyed the film but it just shat all over so much Star Trek canon while honouring so much more that it was frankly confusing. Is it JJ's own baby? Is it Star Trek? I can't tell. Things like Kronos (Qo'Nos?) to Earth in 20 seconds. Preposterous depictions of gravity. However I totally agree that its main failing was that it switched from a film that had a great and intriguing plot with a character who just happened to be Khan, and maybe with the odd *nod* to what happened in the other universe (read: not shoehorning old Spock in for little reason, read: NOT doing THAT line), to one that was just Wrath of Khan but Alternate™. It was really interesting despite the inconsistencies. But yes, it fell down.  I was really excited at the start when Scotty went ""They're turning Starfleet into a military organisation, I thought we were exploratory."" That and a few other parts really made me feel that Abrams was going to do what DS9 did and actually explore Starfleet's intentions and aims. It was like it was reaching for it but didn't quite make it, I was quite sad.  And don't even get me started on the warp battle. I like the part where half of the Enterprise was travelling faster than light and half wasn't and yet it wasn't obliterated at the atomic level.  And one more thing, and this might seem counter to my previous points, but I was *really* disappointed that there wasn't any big space battles! I loved the space combat in ST09, and there wasn't all that much here.  Edit: It was confusing.There were so many references to the old shows that it felt like a ""fan's film"", and yet it ignored so much more.  Edit 2: seriously why did the Enterprise need to be underwater? It makes no sense? How did it get there in the first place without the natives seeing? Why were they doing any of that? Why not just beam all of the things?",™

t5_2r2dd,Loeb,1368725423,"I'm not 100% sure. If I'm remembering correctly, Fomenko believes we simply cannot know; writing was invented in only 800 AD, according to Fomenko, and while civilization existed before that point, they left no traces to uncover. Religious and political leaders felt they needed historical precedent to legitimize their rule, so they invented thousands of years of history and then wrote books to place in their respective historical periods. (Fomenko bases this upon the fact that the oldest historical manuscripts date back to only the 11th century, which is true! But while modern historians would say these 11th century manuscripts are simply copies of previous pre-11th century manuscripts, Fomenko would say no, these manuscripts aren't copies, and the reason our oldest manuscripts date back to the 11th century is because thats when they *were created*.)  *edit:* And if you're asking, ""Well what about the Dead Sea Scrolls or other obviously pre-11th century works?"" Fomenko would just out-and-out deny the antiquity of those manuscripts. He manages to create a near unfalsifiable doctrine: everything ""ancient"" was created in the 11th to 15th centuries, so if you find some evidence of writing or civilization or art before 1000, it was obviously forged. If it matches Fomenko's theory, it's TRUE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE™, but if it goes against Fomneko's theory, it's forged, obviously.",™

To make the marinade, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, honey, garlic, cumin, chili powder, seafood seasoning, black pepper, and hot sauce in a bowl until blended. Place the tilapia in a shallow dish, and pour the marinade over the fish. Cover, and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours. 1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Set grate 4 inches from the heat. 1. Remove fish from marinade, drain off any excess and discard marinade. Grill fish pieces until easily flaked with a fork, turning once, about 9 minutes. 1. Assemble tacos by placing fish pieces in the center of tortillas with desired amounts of tomatoes, cilantro, and cabbage; drizzle with dressing. To serve, roll up tortillas around fillings, and garnish with lime wedges.    **Tortillas**  1/2 cup coconut flour  1/2 tsp baking powder  1/4 tsp salt  1 &amp; 1/2 cup egg whites  3/4 cup almond milk  Mix all ingredients in a bowl, then let sit for about 10 minutes while the coconut flour soaks up the moisture, then stir again Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat and spray with cooking spray Pour a 1/4 cup of the mixture into the pan and swirl around until the entire pan is coated even and thinly After a minute or two try lifting the sides with a spatula to check if it’s ready to flip. I found the most effective method for flipping was to spray a second pan, heat it up, and flip the current tortilla into that pan Also, if it breaks in a place (and it might) you can scoop a little mixture into the crack and cook a little longer, flip again, then remove from the pan Continue these steps for each tortilla, spraying the pan each time Assemble your tacos and serve",™

t5_2qnwb,kalayna,1368727897,"Yep, that's still me more often than I'd like to admit. ;) It's getting easier to find healthier food that's convenient, but usually there's a cost trade-off. We finally have a Whole Foods- helpful *when* I have time to shop there- and a local supermarket has an awesome salad bar. Oh, and Chipotle. ♥. And I really have no business getting up for work @ 4 when I'm happiest up till 2am.   I do try to make bigger batches of some staples- rice, quinoa, etc when I am cooking it so I can toss the leftover in the freezer, which makes it MUCH easier to throw something together in just a few minutes. That being said though, I'm pretty happy w/some frozen or fresh veggies thrown in a pan w/canned tomatoes and/or broth with a grain and seasoned. Usually with either beans or nuts tossed in for protein. There are some relatively healthy bars to be had, and frozen food is my @ work staple.   In terms of getting there... I stick with small changes. It took me nearly a month to embark on my grand experiment. In that time my brain got used to the idea, I slowly stocked up my kitchen for things that might make life easier, etc. But even if it's the really seemingly cheesy stuff- parking farther away from a building, stopping for a bag of apples at the grocery next to the gas station where you might normally pick up a candy bar (thus saving you stops in the long run, time win!)- it all adds up. Some of it will stick, some probably won't. If you keep looking for those little things, eventually they make an impact which can make the next little thing easier to find and/or implement. ",♥

t5_2to85,Draconics,1368741652,"**HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, we had possibly one of the greatest episodes of all time. 6 People were killed, leaving Pakratt alone, Pause &amp; MC crippled, and the Iron Kurtain dominating. While everyone else was dying, 3 teams improved by avoiding combat. Etho died (for the fourth time) to his Kryptonite, Pause. Pyro showed to be the better Paul of UHC 10, and Pakratt fled to fight another day. Last episode was great, and I’m sure that everyone is excited for S10E6 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1. Guude BJ (Up 1)  *Why?*:  One can make the case that Uppercats deserves to be in this spot. However, due to the falling of other high ranked teams such as Sobriety, PEP, and PIMP, Guude BJ is nearly the undisputed #1. They have excellent equipment and are in great shape in terms of health. Not only do they have a Power IV bow and wolves, the have Guude—who is the most experienced and best strategist. They also have the most chemistry of any team, which gives them a distinct advantage.  *How Can They Improve?*: Obviously not much to improve on considering they’re the best team in my opinion. While diamond swords would help them out immensely, they’re likely better off hunting down people for more resources. Ideally, they could find some better melee weaponry, and likely win it all.  *Season Outlook*: At the moment, unless they have some cataclysmic catastrophe or get involved in a huge amount of PvP, they’re likely to win it all, or at least place high.  2 Uppercats (Up 1)  *Why?*: They are the only other team to not have been involved in any combat. They have slowly risen up m rankings, thanks to in large part their impressive gear and consistent health, despite their drunkenness. Their team works extremely well together, and has great chemistry. They have the highest health of any player, though I still put them below Guude BJ due to some strategic disadvantages (namely: wolves and extra apples).   *How Can They Improve?*: All they can do is make small improvements to their enchantments, and go hunting for others. Aside from wolves, they are nearly exactly on par with Guude BJ.   *Season Outlook*:  At this point, the only team that can truly give them trouble is Guude BJ. Otherwise, they’re set to be another favorite to win it all.  3 Sobriety (Up 2)  *Why?*: Despite the huge battle, they still have a fair amount of health. While they did lose a large amount of health, it can be argued that this team made the most progress out of anyone last episode. They finally got enchantments. Most importantly, they showed that with a highly well enchanted weapon in the hands of a good man (who is now going to war), they are virtually unstoppable. The sheer dominance they had over M.A.N. was totally impressive. They still have one of the best players in the game in Kurt, while also having great chemistry amongst all of them. They are all skilled players that work with each other well.   *How Can They Improve?*: If they can successfully recover from the battle with M.A.N., they’re set. Everyone saw what they can do with their excellent teamwork—the question is if they can use that teamwork and heal up their injuries from battle.   *Season Outlook*: It all depends on this next episode. If they can recover enough health, they can easily do serious damage to any team.   4 Blame the ~~Generik~~ Beef (Up 2)  *Why?*: While teams like PIMP and PEP have been dying, the first team to engage in combat has managed to climb up by taking an extremely good approach to one-man-down survival. They both have high health (despite a wasted golden apple) and fine equipment.   *How Can They Improve?*: They obviously cannot get Generik back, so the one thing they can do is wait out the storm and wait for others to die off. Should they be able to consistently stay at high enough health, they could potentially be favorites. They must continue to grind out resources and wait.   *Season Outlook*: Considering how they’ve been playing in recent episodes, actually quite high for a team that missing a man. If other teams start losing men and they can continue to survive, they may become a come-from-behind favorite.  5 PIM ~~P~~ (Down 4)  *Why?*: Five &amp; Six are almost interchangeable, but I hand it to PIM ~~P~~ because they have 2 of the most accomplished PvPers, and have higher potential in the unlikely scenario that they manage to recover from a deadly brawl with Etho and Paul. Though both are skilled in battle, MC is made of glass and Pause would die easily as well.   *How Can They Improve?*: They must recover if they want any chance at all. They have fine equipment from back when they were pimpin’ and ruling the land with diamonds and gold, but they have to grind out resources and recover an amount of health that no one besides Anderz ever has.   *Season Outlook*: Bleak. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least one of them dies to the environment this episode.   6 ~~PE~~ P (Down 2) *Why?*: I don’t want to be critical of Pak, but I don’t believe that he can handle himself against MC and Pause, 2 very accomplished PvPers. His confidence is extremely low—you have to wonder about the psychological effects of that battle. While he watched his teammates die, he had an opportunity to at least kill MC (if not Pause and MC)—but instead fled (dug away).   *How Can They Improve?*: A lot he must do—but not much he can do. All he can do is play it out until he’s maxed out in equipment and health. Otherwise, he has no chance.  *Season Outlook*: Extremely low. While I don’t believe that he will die to the environment, any team (potentially except for PE ~~P~~)  would likely kill him without issue. He needs a miracle to win it now.  7 ~~M.A.N.~~ (No Movement)  *Why?*: Yeah, they sort of died.   *How Can They Improve?*: Learn not to get “Kurtified”.  *Season Outlook*: Zero, unless they come back from the grave and wreak their revenge.    *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate. Power Rankings are based off the previous episode and are released right before the current episode is released. Power Rankings are meant to give insight onto what may happen next episode based on how ready teams or people are. Draconics Corp. ©2013*",©

I'd rather they just say something about it instead of continuing with the Will They Or Won't They thing. They're throwing human/angel hybrids out there, loads of human/Supe relationships, and Dean and Cas hunting cupids and mates for an *unexpectedly* (rolls eyes) manly gay guy. ""I need you""'s, hugs, soul searching gazes, heavy heartfelt conversations, married couple-like fights, make-up gifts, etc. etc....  Honestly, I think they would get more viewers by confirming it than they would by continuing to tease everyone. This way it just annoys everyone. The shippers don't like it because it's too ambiguous and the non-shippers don't like it because they don't like people shipping the uber straight Dean or whatever. As long as it was done well, I think a lot of non-shippers would accept it. If they confirmed that they *weren't* a thing, that wouldn't stop the shipping at all, but it would make all their hints to Destiel pretty aggravating if they had never planned to do it. They need to have some freakin' GUTS and just take a stand.   P.S. - I'm really pissed about the flippant, sudden death of Naomi and also about Metadouche calling her a ""bitch.""

t5_2qh4w,MemoryLapse,1368773408,"Absolutely. I'm on my phone, so I'm not going to link references  The average weight of a gull is about 1.75 kilos, or 3.8 lbs. I will assume that drug effects are proportional to rats, as gulls are just rats with wings.   We're assuming we're using the liquid ""NyQuil Cough®"", as it has only the hypnotics and sedatives with none of the acetaminophen. It contains 15 mg Dextromethorphan and 6.25 mg doxylamine succinate per 15 ml of liquid.   Dextromethorphan is a dissociative hallucinogen at higher than recommended doses. For humans, 600 mg or higher can cause a dissociative state. DXM has an LD50 of 150 mg/kg, or about 10,000 milligrams for a 150 lb human. Gulls weigh about 2.53% as much as an average human. Therefore, they should become dissociative at 15 mg of DXM, or 15 mL of medicine. 270 mL will kill a gull.  Doxylamine succinate has a profound sedative effect at fairly low doses, but doesn't kill very easily. The LD50 is 470 mg/kg in mice, which means it would take approximately 2 liters of medicine to kill a gull.  270 mL is fairly close to a cup. That's how much will kill a gull. My suggestion is half that*however many gulls there are in the area. , spread out over many pieces of bread. Assuming the gulls eat according to the Gaussian distribution, very few should die.",®

t5_2qm9d,LEGEN--wait_for_it,1368786366,"**Stanford-USC**  **24-23**  **October 6th, 2007**  Why?  * It is the biggest upset in college football history. Stanford was a 41-point underdog. That's 6 TDs and 5 PATs for those keeping score at home.  * It is the ultimate David vs. Goliath. Stanford, a team that went 1-11 the previous year, slew the mighty Trojans in the Coliseum, where they had not lost in six years.  * The story lines behind the two Stanford players responsible for the game-winning TD are incredible. 1) QB Tavita Pritchard becomes starter for the game six days before the game when QB TC Ostrander suffers seizure. In his first collegiate start, Pritchard leads a late comeback against the #1 team in the country on the road. 2) WR Mark Bradford missed several days of practice the week of the game to attend his father's funeral in SoCal. Bradford catches the game-winning TD.   * It was a great fucking game. Homerism aside, this was a phenomenal game. Stanford is shut out in the first half, but gains some momentum when it stops USC at the 1-yard line right before halftime. Stanford's defense intercepts four passes, scoring one TD. Tavita Pritchard leads a late drive down 17-23 in order to get the go-ahead TD. The winning drive included a 4th and 20 reception by Richard Sherman (yep, he used to be a WR) and a 4th and 10 TD reception with 49 seconds left in the game. Basically, it was a perfect storm for Stanford resulting in a 1-point, last minute victory.  * This game is responsible for revitalizing the Stanford-USC rivalry (which is actually older than the UCLA-USC rivalry). This may also be considered the start of the Carroll-Harbaugh rivalry.  * This game might be solely responsible for reviving Stanford football. Without this game, maybe Harbaugh doesn't pick up the necessary recruits, maybe the team doesn't improve as quickly as expected and returns to mediocrity. You can rarely point to a single defining game for a program, but for Stanford you can. It is this game.  Check List:  ✔  41-point underdog (David)  ✔  #1 powerhouse (Goliath)  ✔  Rivalry  ✔  Jim Harbaugh/Pete Carroll  ✔  First Collegiate Start for Game-winning QB  ✔  Game-winning TD Caught by Grieving Son  ✔  4th and 20 catch (which went about 20.5 yards) during last drive  ✔  4th down game-winning TD catch with less than a minute left  ✔  1 point is as close as it gets  EDIT: formatting, damnit.",✔

Systematic review: faecal microbiota transplantation in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Anderson JL, Edney RJ, Whelan K. Source  Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division, School of Medicine, King's College London, London, UK. Abstract BACKGROUND:  The intestinal microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used for the management of IBD as well as infectious diarrhoea. AIM:  To undertake a systematic review of FMT in patients with IBD. METHODS:  The systematic review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Nine electronic databases were searched in addition to hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were reports (RCT, nonrandomised trials, case series and case reports) of FMT in patients with IBD. RESULTS:  Of the 5320 articles identified, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, none of which were controlled trials. There were nine case series/case reports of patients receiving FMT for management of their IBD, and eight where FMT was for the treatment of infectious diarrhoea in IBD. These 17 articles reported on 41 patients with IBD (27 UC, 12 Crohn's, 2 unclassified) with a follow-up period of between 2 weeks and 13 years. Where reported, FMT was administered via colonoscopy/enema (26/33) or via enteral tube (7/33). In patients treated for their IBD, the majority experienced a reduction of symptoms (19/25), cessation of IBD medications (13/17) and disease remission (15/24). There was resolution of C. difficile infection in all those treated for such (15/15).  **CONCLUSIONS:**  **Whilst the available evidence is limited and weak, it suggests that faecal microbiota transplantation has the potential to be an effective and safe treatment for IBD, at least when standard treatments have failed. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to investigate these findings.**  © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",©

You get to see him being Mr. Quirky, you get to see him being Mr. Clever, and you get a nice introduction to the TARDIS once it finishes repairing itself.  If you want to start your friends off with Clara, I'd probably go with the Christmas special. I feel it does a better job at introducing the Clara Conundrum™, as it doesn't make a major deal about it until the end, and you see him segway into Bells of St. John. I feel the way Bells handled it was in a manner that assumed the audience was already privy to what was going on.  I also feel it does a better job at showing off The Doctor, and who he is. Especially since the episode is all about how he can't fight who he is, and at the end of the day he can't ignore a good adventure. Bells, to me, was more about him trying to get a girl he was obsessed with(Almost seemingly for no reason if you haven't watched the Christmas special)to come adventure with him.

t5_2qhwp,shanereid1,1368835019,"Since when has the specs of a console had any impact at all on its success?  The PS1 wasn't as powerful as the N64, the PS2 wasn't as powerful as the Xbox, and the Wii wasn't as powerful as the PS3. Now compare their hardware sales. The perfect example of this can be seen in the handheld market.   As part of the fourth generation, the Game Boy competed with the Sega Game Gear, Atari Lynx, and the TurboExpress. The full color game gear sold 11 million units worldwide. The monochrome gameboy sold 118.69 million.  Secondly, Nintendo hasn't relied on third party games to sell their consoles since the SNES.    [Just look at the best-selling games for the Game cube for example we have](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games#Nintendo_GameCube) Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mario Kart: Double Dash‼, Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Luigi's Mansion and Animal Crossing.   If the sales for the £150 Wii U are bad, then I can’t imagine that the sales for the £300+ PS4 or Xboxwhatever will be much better. ",‼

t5_2qmeb,Lord_Retardus,1368879996,"Quoting from the guy near the top:  &gt;• The LEGO® brand name should always be written in capital letters.  &gt;• The LEGO brand name must never be used as a generic term or in the plural or as a possessive pronoun, e.g. “LEGO’s”.  &gt;• When the LEGO brand name is used as part of a noun, it must never appear on its own. It should always be accompanied by a noun. For example, LEGO set, LEGO products, LEGO Group, LEGO play materials, LEGO bricks, LEGO universe, etc.  &gt;The last page of this PDF: http://cache.lego.com/upload/contentTemplating/AboutUsFactsAndFiguresContent/otherfiles/downloadC60A8E1ACF6EEDBEFB62747F119FBDC6.pdf",®

Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.  &gt;The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game’s three lead characters, playing all sides of the game’s interwoven story.  &gt;All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto’s darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.  &gt;Developed by series creators Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V will be available worldwide on September 17th for Xbox 360® and PlayStation®3.",®

t5_2to85,Draconics,1368914183,"**HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, we had a relatively uneventful episode. It was essentially the calm before the storm as some teams started going on the prowl, while others made final preparations or tried to recover. Pakratt attempted to journey to the Nether—only to fail and not find his things. Last episode was great, and I’m sure that everyone is excited for S[Season Number]E[Episode Number] of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**Guude BJ** (No Movement)  *Why?*:  Same reasons as last time—very little happened in this past episode to warrant my favorite to win it all to lose their #1 spot. While Uppercats did start gaining ground, Guude BJ would still likely win a battle with them (something that may actually happen). They are set on equipment, and they are overall the best team in terms of chemistry and who makes up the team. Guude is an excellent strategist, Baj is experienced, and Jsano, while a rookie, is fitting along right with them.   *How Can They Improve?*: They’re about as set as they can be—all they can do right now is continue to go on the prowl until they find life—and end that life.  *Season Outlook*: Extremely good. They remain the odds-on favorite to win it all. The only plausible possibility that could prevent them from being high-finishers is if they engage Uppercats in combat—a battle they would likely win, but would leave them near death.  2	**Uppercats** (No Movement)  *Why?*: While they certainly lose points for being somewhat incapacitated (Doc is playing extremely late, and they’re playing drunk), they are undoubtedly extremely well-equipped and have a great team chemistry. They (like Guude BJ) have had the good fortune/strategy of not engaging anyone in combat—and as a result, they are extremely ready for battle.   *How Can They Improve?*: They just started getting on the move, so ditto everything here that was said for Guude BJ. A battle between them at Guude BJ would either decide the winner of the season, or end them.  *Season Outlook*: All that needs to happen for them to be favorites is for them to take down Guude BJ—a tall order, but doable.  3	**Sobriety** (No Movement)  *Why?*: The Iron Kurtain and the Sober Ingots are quickly regaining ground after an efficient, but still damaging battle against M.A.N. They have managed to bring Kurt up to good health, but they may need to do a few things more before they’re ready to engage in combat. Regardless, with strong equipment and the Iron Kurtain on their team, they’re still up there in the rankings. Nothing happened at all for them to lose their position, but they still must recover.  *How Can They Improve?*: While they can likely take out any team below them, they must gain more hearts, or wait out the storm before they can be considered favorites to win it all.  *Season Outlook*: Good—but it could be better.  4	**Blame The ~~Generik~~ Beef** (No Movement)  *Why?*:  While Beef did lose some health, BTC is quickly showing that his name ought to be changed to Blame The Unbreakability, and they are still absolutely loaded in terms of gold. Even though they are a man down, they have been extremely successful in the past few episodes. With good equipment, they’re doing surprisingly well for the first team to suffer a loss.  *How Can They Improve?*: If they can maintain their high health while everyone else around them dies, they could end up being considered favorites. They should just continue to grind out resources until then.  *Season Outlook*: Surprisingly high for a team that has been a man down for several episodes. If they can wait out the storm, they could potentially be come-from-behind favorites.  5	**~~PE~~ P** (Up 1)  *Why?*: The only move on today’s power rankings come at the very bottom, as injury to PIM and finding a large amount of gold moves Pakratt up to #5. While he is on a crash course to engage Uppercats (and almost undoubtedly die), and his Nether trip did fail, he had an extremely successful caving adventure. He would undoubtedly beat out PIM in a rematch.  *How Can They Improve?*: He must continue to grind out resources and wait out the storm if he wants his extremely low chance of making a comeback to break through.  *Season Outlook*: Very low. Not only is he by himself, his morale is low and he’s about to run into an extremely well-equipped team in Uppercats.  6	**PIM ~~P~~** (Down 1)  *Why?*: While they did manage to recover some health, it was almost completely negated by skeletons and some fooling around at the end. They are very low on health, and their chances of recovery are minimal, optimistically speaking.  *How Can They Improve?*: Recover health and improve equipment. There are a lot of things that they must do—but very little that they can do.  *Season Outlook*: They need a miracle to win it now.   7	**M.A.N.** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Yeah they sort of died.  *How Can They Improve?*: Learn not to get “Kurtified”.  *Season Outlook*: They can obviously come back to life and make the most improbably comeback in the history of UHC, if they properly plan it out.  *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by Draconics are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2sokd,Kitaru,1368914798,"Hi, hello, I'm the red jacket kid with the shitty explanation. :p It was kind of hard to work through it on the spot during the interview on camera. It probably doesn't help that my long and bad explanation, for obvious reasons, was cut down to more of just the gist of things for the film. Sorry about that!  Anyway, in addition to the in-depth explanation from /u/ParanoidDrone, I think I can offer up a ELI5 ""proof"" by appeal to intuition as to why Tetris is an NP problem. There are around ten to forty ways we can drop any given piece on the stack. We can drop one piece and look at the shape of the stack and say it looks ""good,"" but what about ""perfect?"" For that we'd have to keep going along and checking how every future piece is affected by what we've placed before it. But, if every branch from our first ten goes on to make another ten branches, which all go on to make another ten branches, which all go onto make another... you have this fractal explosion of ""possible futures"" to look at every time you so much as place a single piece, which is going to take A Lot of Time™.  So, when the movie says ""Translation: A computer cannot be programmed to find the perfect moves during a game of Tetris,"" they really mean to say ""...because it would take impossibly long to actually examine all of the branches to determine what 'perfect' is."" There are some really good approximations (such as [Ryan Heise's AI](http://www.ryanheise.com/tetris/tetris_artificial_intelligence.html)), but you can't really speak to whether it's ""perfect"" because, again, it would take inhumanly long to for a computer to examine all possibilities.  The article [""Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate""](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0210020) goes the extra step to, you know, actually prove NP-Completeness by expressing it in terms of a different NP-Complete problem. (I have some qualms with said article making a lot of assumptions that don't apply to ""real world Tetris,"" such as assuming a randomizer that is playing against you or placing restrictions on rotation that don't exist in many current versions of the game. However, I know that this generalized problem is the only reasonable way to actually make a concrete proof of anything.)  It's interesting to note that the modern standard rules found in most games after 2001 have been proven to be incredibly stable: the [Tetris wiki article Playing Forever](http://tetrisconcept.net/wiki/Playing_Forever) demonstrates a 140 piece looping pattern that can be performed under the current rules of the game. Since the current selection method shuffles and deals sets of the unique seven pieces, you have a guaranteed rate at which each of the pieces will be received. Hold and sufficient previews also allows for the few ""problem groupings"" that exist to be swapped to the another, safe ordering.

These criteria also apply to any deck construction and draft portions of a limited tournament. Additionally, no notes of any kind may be mad e during a draft. Some team formats have additional communication rules that may modify the definition of this infraction. Notes made outside the current match may only be referenced between games, and must have been in the player’s possession since the b eginning of the match. Examples A. During a game, a player references play notes that were created before the tournament. Penalty Game Los s Penalty Match Loss 13 B. A spectator points out the correct play to a player who had not solicited the information. Philosophy Tournaments test the skill of a pla yer, not his or her ability to follow external advice or directions. Any strategy advice, play advice, or construction advice from an external source is considered outside assistance. Visual modifications to cards, including brief text, that provide minor strategic information or hints are acceptable and not considered notes. Detailed instructions or complex strategic advice may not be written on cards. The Head Judge is the final arbiter on what cards and notes are acceptable for a tournament.

[Hartz for Veterinary Professionals](http://hugprofessional.com/Hartz_Efficacy/Flea_and_Tick_Drops_for_Cats.aspx)   &gt;The adulticide active ingredient found in Hartz® UltraGuard® brand flea and tick drops for cats is etofenprox. With low acute oral and dermal toxicity in mammals, etofenprox provides a safe and effective active to control fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on cats. (Effective against adult fleas and mosquitoes, and 3 of the 4 tick life stages.)  The mode of action for etofenprox is similar to pyrethroids but its chemical structure is very different. Etofenprox is:      Not a traditional pyrethroid.     Unlike pyrethroids, not an ester.     An ether, classified as a ""reduced risk pesticide"".     No adverse reactions at doses 5x in dogs, puppies, cats or kittens.     Oral LD50 is &gt;42,800 vs &gt;5,000 for phenothrin and vs. 1,500 for pyrethrins.     Used in cat/kitten products due to high efficacy and low toxicity.   &gt;Pyrethroids are NOT tolerated well by cats. Etofenprox is a new generation active ingredient that is well tolerated by cats. It is different from all of traditional pyrethroids currently available, which are esters. As a non-ester compound, etofenprox has unique chemistry and biological activity that account for its wide margin of safety in cats, as well as dogs. That’s why Hartz® UltraGuard Pro® Flea &amp; Tick Drops for Cats is a uniquely effective combination of etofenprox and (S)-methoprene, two proven active ingredients that are well-suited to felines.",®
t5_2qh6c,Kanshan,1368944225,"&gt;A majority of Christians in America are stupid  A majority are Roman Catholic, who most don't view being Christian as patriotic.

So then why do you keep attempting to ""save"" all of these sinners over and over again. Where does it say in the bible that we are suppose to MAKE people believe in the Gospel.  So we should stop sharing God's word. Because they have already heard it? What? We should always be looking to share God's word and love with the unsaved. All the time, never ceasing. We shouldn't cram it down people's throats but we should never not share it when given the chance.  &gt;The only thing a true christian should be concerned about is his or her own walk in faith  If we don't share our faith then how will anyone else be saved?

I don't hate people who aren't white, and I hate plenty of ""white"" names, but that doesn't make me racist. Even if you run the ""cultural bias"" gambit, we're living in a predominantly interracial world, and 12.5% of America's population (where I am from) are foreign-born. I simply like some names, and dislike others.    I hate the name Samantha, for example. And Greta. No real-life emotional ties, no dislike of their linguistic roots, I just don't like the way they sound. /shrug   Oh, oh, I know what names I hate: names based on existing things. Fantasy naming tropes make it very hard to read anything with magic in it...   And after reading the article, here's my two cents: we shouldn't interfere with a person's right to change their name to whatever stupid thing they want, unless it is interfering with that person's life (ex: excessive bullying), or it in itself causes illegal things to happen (like naming yourself after someone you look exactly like, or their social security number, or ""I hereby declare you my legal executor,"" or Pepsi, unless Pepsi pays you to do it so your name is Pepsi™ etc). Otherwise, I think it should be free game and at your country/state's age of legal majority/adulthood, you get a free name change just in case your parents still fucked up.    Why don't we get a free name change anyway? We never get to pick our names, and I am sure there are more than a handful of people who would do so if it weren't so intimidating (^yesiamalsotalkingaboutme) and also cost money. It just seems logical given, again, that we didn't get to choose, but it's something that will stay with us for (almost) our entire lives. Aside from the obvious legal importance, our name really only matters to us, because it kinda defines who we are. Even if we don't quite fit the stereotypical ""Jake"" or ""Finn,"" when others think of us, our personalities are tied to that name.    Whoops, it seems I've entered a rant. I better stop while I'm conscious of it. tumut",™

So, I told one person that I was as certain as could be that they would be supportive.  Then, I told them they could tell others if they want.  After they told someone, then I would go talk to them about it with some foreknowledge of how they have reacted to the information.  Of course, new people you still have to come out to.

t5_2qio8,Seithin,1368987585,"I feel your post is missing two crucial factors; One, the actual percentage of revenue that the transfers make up and two, volume of sales.  The latter has been proved by many F2P games to be a good and sensible business model. Right now the cost of transfers is causing people to dismiss it and either continue playing on low-pop realms or quit, thus reducing possible revenue. A lower cost would, logically, increase the amount of sales and could quite possible become a larger source of revenue with enough sales (As seen in F2P games). For this reason your point of not being able to defend a price reduction in front of shareholders is void. The right model could, in fact, prove to be better for investors than the current one, even with a price reduction and another strategy to solve abusive player behaviour.  The main factor that I feel your post misses, however, is the actual percentage that the paid transfers make up of revenue. In their latest earnings call (May 8th 2013) online subscriptions are $275 Million of the quarterly revenue, with online subscriptions defined as ""Revenue from online subscriptions consists of revenue from all World of Warcraft products, including subscriptions, boxed products, expansion packs, licensing royalties, **value-added services**, and revenues from Call of Duty ®  Elite memberships"" (Emphasis mine). [Source: Activison Blizzard Earnings Call; point 7:Operating segments and geographic region](http://investor.activision.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1104659-13-38868&amp;CIK=718877)  The total revenue of the quarter was 1,324 Million. Now even assuming that the paid transfers take up a huge portion of the *value-added services* - which we don't know - it is ridiculous and illogical to assume the these services take up even a large minority of the entire 275 Million. Subscriptions, game sales and licensing royalties can all be assumed to take up a large portion of the amount. I don't know much abot CoD, but that Elite membership might be a significant portion too. The point is this; Even setting the bar very high for paid transfers, we're looking at the transfers making up somewhere around 1-3% of the quarterly revenue. Most of the total quarterly revenue doesn't even come from WoW, it comes from the consoles.  So in the eyes of an investor, making changes to a model that is making up a miniscule portion of the revenue, that has an adverse affect on the game experience and which *might* even prove to be better for revenue if following a volume-oriented model is not a bad thing. Which means that the model that's in place is *probably not* a model designed for cash grab, but rather to prevent abusive player behaviour as Blizzard has stated themselves. Whether it's the best method to solve that? Probably not, but that doesn't make the model a cash grab and Blizzard liars.  Edit: Grammar and spelling.",®

t5_2sn0p,BobTheHeavy,1369014005,"I was curious what the financial repercussions for Perfect World could be for this, specifically people getting a refund or doing chargebacks. Seems multiple people have reported requesting one from there credit card company. With one large thread about it having reportedly having been deleted from the game forums and all users banned.  I found the following in there terms of service:  """"""If you claim a chargeback for any reason, we have the right to investigate and dispute such chargeback. If we believe that your chargeback requirement is spurious, unreasonable, or invalid, we may take the dispute to court. If your chargeback is deemed invalid, you agree to pay for all fees and costs resulting from the disputed chargeback, including but is not limited to legal fees and expenses, damages, monies lost due to non-operation, and chargeback fees. You may pay for any applicable fees and charges or for Zen by major credit card, PayPal® or other such methods authorized by PWE. """"""  So it seems that Perfect World acknowledges your right to do a chargeback but has legal language to protect themselves in there terms of service. Very complicated issue even further complicated by the fact the game hasn't actually released yet. ",®

Studies of aspartame in the peer reviewed medical literature were surveyed for funding source and study outcome. Of the 166 studies felt to have relevance for questions of human safety, 74 had Nutrasweet® industry related funding and 92 were independently funded.   One hundred percent of the industry funded research attested to aspartame's safety, whereas 92% of the independently funded research identified a problem. A bibliography supplied by the Nutrasweet® Company included many studies of questionable validity and relevance, with multiple instances of the same study being cited up to 6 times.

t5_2qh53,ALoudMouthBaby,1369045127,"&gt; Can anyone tell me how he was able to become vice president in the first place?  If you are interested in a good read about what it takes to make it into the top levels of public office in the US you should really take a look at Richard Caro's biography of LBJ. While it's a long, long read it provides a lot of insight not just into LBJ's life but what it takes to be a successful politician in the USA.  But anyways the short answer LBJ was chosen for the VP slot in '60 for a variety of reasons. The man was legendary for his ability to pass legislation. He also helped to bring the Southern Democrats to the table in favor Kennedy which was important.  The longer answer is that the man was a freaking machine.

t5_2qhq6,kalayna,1369050187,"I second many of the suggestions here- another nice and approachable addition would be a yin approach to the pose. In addition to Paul Grilley (♥), Bernie Clark is another awesome yin guy- www.yinyoga.com is the website. Essentially, you take the squat but with support under your heels. In yin, the goal is to allow the muscles that are so often working in our regular practice to soften, allowing muscles to lengthen, but more importantly to target the connective tissue. Yin also generally involves holding poses longer. So you might start with a minute or less and work your way up to 5 over time, only adding enough height under your heels to support the pose. You'll likely find that pretty quickly you're using less support under your heels. :)   If your knees get cranky here, you can put a prop- pillow, bolster, rolled-up mat or even a rolled up towel or sheet- behind the knees as you come down.

t5_2sa4x,texel1,1369065365,"Sure. RAM is like working memory for programs that are currently running. It stores values and data structures that need to be quickly accessed and manipulated. RAM is on the order of about 100,000 times faster than a spinning platter hard disk for random reads and writes (as in, not reading or writing a large sequential file) so it can speed things up considerably to read commonly used data into RAM.  All modern operating systems also make use of virtual memory, which basically provides a layer of indirection on top of the physical RAM modules– when a program requests an address in memory, it maps to a virtual address space that's managed by the OS, and the OS looks up that address and retrieves it from its actual physical stored location. The upshot of this system is that if you are using more memory than can fit in your physical chips (say all your open programs are using a total of 5.5GB, and you only have 4GB of RAM), the OS can page less-used memory onto the hard drive, and swap it back into the memory chips when a program actually asks for it.  The good news is that it's much harder this way for your system to completely run out of working memory. The bad news is that hard drives are SLOW and as soon as your working set starts overflowing your physical memory requirements, your hard drive can start thrashing, paging tons of data back and forth, and your system slows to a crawl. This is a Very Bad Thing™, and it can be most easily mitigated by getting more RAM. The more physical memory you have, the less likely it is that your operating system will page memory out to disk, so things stay nice and fast because your hard drive never has to come into play for anything except reading and writing files.  There's another win here for SSDs- they're so much faster at random read/write than spinning platter hard drives, that swapping on an SSD isn't nearly as grim of a situation, performance-wise, as swapping on a spinning platter drive. It's still not *ideal*, but it's not horrible. Basically, spinning platter hard drives are the weakest performance link in most modern computers, and if you can avoid using one for your boot drive, you'll see a gigantic qualitative difference in how fast your system feels.",™

As for why to recommend this to an aged mother, I believe the assumption is that this would not be her entire savings, especially given that the author notes that he holds only 60% in equities. It is a replacement for a stock pick, not a portfolio. Though this could be clearer.  He did recommend an index fund:  &gt; Seeks to track the performance of the FTSE® Global All Cap Index, which covers both well-established and still-developing markets.

But probably one of the nicest regulars I've ever had was Brian Grant.  I know, we're supposed to anonymize, but since this is a minor celebrity we're talking about here, I think it's okay.  Plus I'm only going to say nice stuff about him.  For those of you unfamiliar with the man, Brian Grant was a power forward for the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.  He was the one good guy on the team during the infamous ""Jail Blazers"" time frame of the late '90s.  Soft spoken and quick to smile, Grant was heavily involved in charity work.  When he retired from basketball in 2006, he moved back here to Portland, and ended up using my gas station on a regular basis.  What made him cool was that he NEVER treated you as anything other than an equal.  When you made the standard issue Customer Service Small Talk™, he would always engage you back honestly and openly.  He'd ask you questions, and genuinely be interested in your responses.  Sadly, in 2009, he announced that he had Parkinson's Disease.  It was obvious that it made him pretty depressed, you could see it in his eyes.  He still came into the station, and we always made a habit out of trying to cheer him up.  I know he appreciated it, because he'd get this shy smile every time we'd try.  He also knew a lot about us.  The first time he saw me after I came back from my first season of fighting wildfires, he went back to his car and dragged his son in so he could meet ""a real life hero.""  Now I hate being called that, but I wasn't about to argue with Mr Grant, especially not in front of his son.  But I was amazed that he not only remembered me after I had been gone for four months, but that he remembered why I had been gone.  He'd also buy all the employees sodas on hot days, and hot chocolate/coffee on cold days.  Seriously, he's class act.",™

t5_2qmeb,ZweiNor,1369078152,"&gt; Female Nidorans can only breed before evolving [...]  And you should be careful to apply game-logic to the Anime.   From bulbapedia: &gt; * Despite being in the Undiscovered Group, Nidoqueen was shown to be capable of breeding in the anime special Mewtwo Returns, when a cloned Nidoqueen and a cloned Rhyhorn produced Eggs containing both baby Rhyhorn and baby Nidoqueen (not baby Nidoran♀).  &gt; * The cloned Nidoqueen and Rhyhorn are shown to have mated and produced offspring; however, while in the games, not only is Nidoqueen unable to produce Eggs, but if she could, the babies would all be the earliest member of the female evolutionary line. However, this may relate to their nature as clones, although the fact Ash and co. didn't question their existence (or know about the clones yet) would suggest it was simply an error or that the anime has different rules than the games.  There are also counts of pokemon of different sizes (thus the theory that the pokedex sizes is the average size of that pokemon, and not a definite size), like Ash's and Gary's Krabbys.   But since Nidorina evolves with a moonstone, there would atleast have to be a moonstone there for the ""baby"" nidoqueen to exist, and the generally acceptable conclusion is that they are a ""bi-product"" of the clones.  The kangaskhan issue is also just an issue in the games, and not the Anime. [this](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/5/5a/GoodBabyKanga.png) is actually how a baby Kangaskhan looks like. (though in the Anime).  TL;DR The Anime world is a little different from the game world.  ",♀

They're implanting a gene they have identified and selected because they know exactly what it does.  &gt;You can use the generic mysterious unforseen consequences argument on literally any subject, but it lacks any actual substance.  .  hmmm...  .  http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/what-is-a-gene-colinearity-and-transcription-430  What is a Gene? Colinearity and Transcription Units  By: Leslie A. Pray, Ph.D. © 2008 Nature Education   Citation: Pray, L. (2008) What is a gene? Colinearity and transcription units. Nature Education 1(1)   &gt;Alternatives to Colinearity  [...]  &gt;As illustrated in Figure 3, the end result is the same as with alternative splicing: different mRNA molecules are produced from a single protein-coding gene. Clearly, contrary to the conventional notion of a single gene encoding a single protein, a single continuous stretch of DNA can encode multiple mRNA molecules and, ultimately, multiple protein products.  [...]  &gt;Delineating Gene Regions  &gt;It seems that the more scientists learn about the genome and gene expression, the less they seem to be able to identify the point along a stretch of nucleotides at which a single gene actually begins and ends; indeed, it appears to be increasingly more difficult to determine whether there are even actual discrete nucleotide start and stop points for genes. This complexity continues to make it difficult for scientists to agree on exactly what a gene is. At the very least, scientists now know that Crick's original sequence hypothesis was overly simplistic, at least for eukaryotes. Genes are not linear sequences of DNA that directly correspond one-to-one with their protein counterparts.",©

t5_2to85,Draconics,1369086693,"**HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, the last member of PEP was brutally and mercilessly massacred, leaving 2 teams eliminated and Uppercats swimming in gold. Damage was taken everywhere, and PIM is back to their Pimpin’ ways. Last episode was great, and I’m sure that everyone is excited for S10E8 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1 **Uppercats** (Up 1)  *Why?*: Guude BJ finally falls out of the Number 1 spot—not necessarily because of what they did wrong, but what Uppercats has done right. And there are a lot of things that they’ve done right. With their outrageous amount of golden apples (a total of 8), excellent equipment, and an overall excellent team, they are our current favorites. Killing Pak was the ultimate no risk, unbelievably high reward kill. Right now, their main weakness is probably their slight alcohol incapacitation—but until that weakness shows itself to be a crippling one, they should be fine.  *How Can They Improve?*: Take damage so they can use their apples efficiently and get to exactly full health. Kidding, but really—not much they can do in the improvement department.  *Season Outlook*: Considering the fact that they lack proximity to Guude BJ, the only team that could kill them—extremely good. They need a miracle NOT to finish high.  2 **Guude BJ** (Down 1)  *Why?*: While Uppercats had an extremely productive episode, Guude BJ falls due to a loss of health. To be frank, all they’ve been doing the past few episodes is losing health while attempting to find other players—a goal that is fulfilled as of the end of last episode. However, even though they will likely survive a battle with Blame The Beef, they have been surpassed by Uppercats.   *How Can They Improve?*: They must take down Blame The Beef as efficiently as possible, and then continue to recover from damage taken. Also, they must learn not to throw eggs.  *Season Outlook*: Still good, though they have given up their #1 spot.  3 **Sobriety** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Despite some unfortunate damage during the episode, and some big near-death experiences, they are still being led by one of the best players in The Iron Kurtain. They’ve shown their overall team chemistry in combat, and that they are extremely deadly.   *How Can They Improve?*: They must continue to recover health, or wait out the storm (which has now become my favorite phrase).   *Season Outlook*: Fine—but it could be better.  4 **PIM ~~P~~** (Up 2)  *Why?*: Blame The Beef falls controversially, but I’ll get to why later. Meanwhile, PIM had an extremely productive episode, in which they found an outrageous amount of gold. They have nearly enough gold for 5 apples, and they have the most diamond equipment in the history of Ultra Hardcore (a total of 25 diamond in their collective gear). While it’s not quite the miracle they need to make the comeback, they are on their way to fully recovering from a deadly battle. They have fine equipment, and considering how strong both of them are at PvP, they actually stand a chance if they can continue being so productive. The main thing that stands in there could potentially be Pause’ impatience.  *How Can They Improve?*: If they can keep on doing what they did last episode, they’ll be on track for a miraculous comeback.  *Season Outlook*: I said they needed a miracle to win it all now—and they’ve almost got that miracle. If they can continue to recover and wait out the storm, their chances are quite high for a second-to-last-place team.   5 **Blame The ~~Generik~~ Beef** (Down 1)  *Why?*: Before you rage at me for putting these guys below the still-crippled PIM, here’s the reasoning behind the most controversial part of this ranking. While our first team to lose a man has taken a valiant approach to one-man-down survival, our unlikely heroes may not survive much longer (which is the premise of these rankings, of course). Their proximity and mutual sighting of team Guude BJ (one of the most PvP ready teams) may spell the end for both Beef and BTC. Even though they would take down PIM any day, their chances of survival are looking bleak based off the end of last episode. Remember, these rankings are ranking who has the best chance of winning it all.  *How Can They Improve?*: It all depends on what happens between them and Guude BJ. They will most likely have to flee to have a chance of survival, though it is possible that they will pull of the upset in combat. If they can survive this battle, then they will have to wait out the storm (that’s the 3rd time I’ve said that about this team) and potentially be come from behind favorites.   *Season Outlook*: Again, it all depends on this next battle. Based off the fact that neither of them were afraid to engage them at all, it doesn’t seem very likely at all that they will survive Guude BJ.   6 **PEP** (Down 1)  *Why?*: With Pak’s merciless death to Uppercats, they become the second team to become fully eliminated.   *How Can They Improve?*: Learn to work better and not be afraid.   *Season Outlook*: One might think that any chances of them winning are non-existent, but you can’t leave out the possibility of Etho salvaging their series (even though they’re all dead already).  7 **M.A.N.** (No Movement)  *Why?*: They got “Kurtified”.   *How Can They Improve?*: Be more sober when playing UHC.   *Season Outlook*: Nebris’ cheating ways can save their season yet.  *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate. Power Rankings are based off the previous episode and are released right before the current episode is released. Power Rankings are meant to give insight onto what may happen next episode based on how ready teams or people are. Draconics Corp. ©2013*",©
t5_2ranw,somethingimmature,1369086830,"I was your younger brothers. My oldest sister was 21 at the time and had to take care of me (from when i was 6-14 years old) and my little sister (4-12years old) after my mom passed away and my dad worked a lot. We stayed at her house every third day while he did overnights blah blah blah...  I'm 27 now and it took until a few years ago(like 2 years ago) to realize what she gave up to help our family survive. She was real cute too, cost her her social life, boyfriends, money, ...freedom. And everything she did for us was rewarded by nothing really. She got a thank you and an unspoken periodical gratefulness from us that we never tell her about. What kind of reward is that? We have a great relationship now. But man, what a thankless job to aquire. And you're in the same boat.  Truth is, it seems you guys have been dealt a shitty situation. And if you walked away, those kids would survive without you. But it would change them forever. Their shitty situation would turn from ""crappy mental parents ...but we always had our brother and were doing okay"" to ""crappy mental parents, brother that couldn't take care of us, ::additional consequences of that::, ::questionable outcome of their lives::""  Its easy to do what's right when its easy, but to do what's right when its the hardest thing to do -that's what builds character.   You're not alone. There's lots of people who can relate. But in a sense you guys are completely unique. For those kids, you're everything they need right now. You get to be some ones hero. And you guys will never know what you mean to eachother until much later, when you look back. Its thankless, for now, but it is rewarding. And moments like these will define you.  Stay strong, find yourself some support (because your allowed to feel anyway you feel about this, it DOES suck), and don't neglect yourself too much.  Alright, I gotta go.

t5_2rjz2,TheIslander829,1369095957,"I understand.   &gt; I prefer partners that are very obviously into me, not partners I have to browbeat into it.  I prefer them too. The thing is most women aren't the kind to just let you go from kissing to sex (the first time you're with her) without any sort of interruption. Remember in her mind she's trying to justify being with you and trying not to feel like a slut (which is a constant worry for women). Her brain is literally going ""ok, if I stop him at my bra, I'm not a slut""... other girls go ""ok, if I stop him at my panties I'm not a slut"". Every woman is different. And you know what? They're right! If she lets me go from kissing to sex without stopping me at any moment, and it's a girl I've interacted with no more than 15 hours (that's talk time, text time, and face-to-face time combined), I'm gonna think less of her. She has to do some interruptions and follow up with ""I usually never do this™"" at some point so she has a clear conscience, but I know what's up. ",™

t5_2cneq,Aemilius_Paulus,1369108773,"If you don't think that the 'past' is not alive and well and the white men don't have a field day keeping the blacks down, then I invite you to visit the town where I currently reside: Richmond, VA.  You moan and bitch about white men being oppressed and being victims on /r/mensrights but you don't think blacks have any excuses? O'rly? The *spirit* of Obama's speech was correct - it was an inspirational speech, meant to be like that. However, some redditors are taking it for a hard fact, which is not what the phrase was intended to be interpreted as. It was not a comment on the black-white equality of today. It was a speech to black graduates, as the title said, so it was a motivational speech that was meant to have that 'sting' that spurs people into action.   As usual, you don't seem to read the links provided to you. You berated me for having low intelligence and being unable to read links and yet time and time again you fail reading the ones handed to you.   Here is what else Obama said in that speech: *""Not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they haven’t,” he said. “It’s not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; that’s still out there.* Funny how so many here failed to actually read the link before rushing to circlejerk their views.   The basic gist of the speech wasn't that the time of racism and discrimination or blaming the past and white man is over. They aren't. All of those things are still relevant. The point of his speech was that US needs to push forward no matter what because of the brutal competition around our globe. It was not a speech saying that we have gone past racism of the white men - if you want an example that hits close to home, [the frontpage of reddit begs to differ](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1eq0oq/these_idiots_were_standing_on_the_side_of_a_road/) (too bad I did not get the snapshot before the racist ones were deleted - they were on the top of the comments).

If you want to worry about your exposure to ""chemicals"", there's probably far more toxic stuff in the air you breathe.  Fluoride is probably the least of your worries if, for example you live near a major roadway.  &gt; This is why, if you look at the water in your local market they sell bottled ""nursery"" water, which 4 out of 5 times, is labeled as non-fluoridated  My local market also sells homeopathic remedies and more.  Inclusion in my local market has nothing to do with scientific merit.  And no.  I've never seen ""nursery water"".  But their stance on fluoride makes it pretty clear that their products have very little relevance to this subject whatsoever:   http://www.nurserywater.com/nursery/fluoride.php  &gt; The American Dental Association (ADA) supports the level for optimally fluoridated water at 0.7 parts per million (ppm) &gt; &gt; Nursery® Water has a fluoride level of up to 0.7 ppm.

You've still got more so I ask you to lie back and throw your legs all the way back.... I want you to shower yourself and fill your mouth with your piss while I slide my tongue deep inside your ass.  When you explode with cum and piss I swallow every last drop... but now it's my turn... I have to pee desperately, so we start all over again!  ♥  http://lenoirgold.blogspot.com/",♥

These are the feminists who NOW use as a shield to claim ""feminism is about equality!!"" while simultaneously propagating their misandric bullshit.  It's total PR spin, and they don't even realize they're doing it for free.  Hell, the entire idea of The Patriarchy™ has been around as a feminist concept since the 80's.

This prevented us from correctly weighing the device  beforehand, and conducting a thermal analysis of the same without the powder charge, prior to  evaluating its yield with the charge in position. The choice of placing the thermal camera under  the E-Cat HT should also be considered unsatisfactory, as was the impossibility of evaluating the  real emissivity of the cylinder's paint coating.""  ""The outer surface of the E-Cat HT2 and one side of the flange are coated with black paint,  different from that used for the previous test. The emissivity of this coating, a Macota® enamel  paint capable of withstanding temperatures up to 800 °C, is not known; moreover, it was not  sprayed uniformly on the device, as may be seen from the non-uniform distribution of colors in  adjacent areas in the thermal imaging.""  ""The E-Cat HT2's power supply departs from that of the device used in December in that it is  no longer three-phase, but single-phase: the TRIAC power supply has been replaced by a control  circuit having three-phase power input and single-phase output, mounted within a box, the  contents of which were not available for inspection, inasmuch as they are part of the  industrial trade secret.""",®

t5_2s5oq,Cleffer,1369180376,"Technically, you're 100% correct.  The last thing you EVER want to do is admit guilt.  This not only gives the officer the right to write you a speeding ticket, but also justifies him pulling you over for whatever other ""non-initiating"" offense he finds.   For example, an officer cannot pull you over for DUI.  He can only pull you over for observations of your driving ability such as swerving, improper signal usage, improper lane change, running a stop sign... THOSE are the initiating offenses that lead to a DUI investigation.  Once you admit to the offense, you give him free reign.    I have immediate family and multiple in-laws who are police officers.  And while a majority of them appreciate honesty and would find a bow to his control and authority appealing, it's perfectly reasonable and accurate to admit there is a poisonous element out there.  Everything from the officer who is just simply having a bad day at work all the way to officer who gets off on on the power trip, they exist, and they may be standing outside your window.  How do you know?    Add to this that YOU have no idea that the officer KNOWS how fast you were going.  He simply could have SUSPECTED that you were going to fast.  He pulls you over, you admit it.. BAM, ticket.   And does anyone also think that if he runs your name through the system and you come back with multiple moving violations in the last few years, he's going to cut you a break again??  Hardly.   Sorry you're getting lambasted by the The Hive Mind™.  You are absolutely 100% technically correct. ",™

t5_2r6f3,Rhyinn,1369189127,"*Conflict theory   a.	From the conflict perspective social problems are the natural and inevitable outcome of social struggle. Under each social problem lies at its essence a conflict of limited resources between the more and less powerful.   b.	Human nature runs on the importance of interests over norms and values, the pursuit of interests generate various types of conflict as normal aspects of social life( social structures), rather than abnormal or dysfunctional occurrences. (Marshall, 1998) These interest are resources which are limited (money, power, influence, leisure, sexual partners), and these resources are in fierce competition. Individuals and groups that benefit from any particular structure strive to see it maintained.   Change occurs because of conflicting interest . Human nature is designed towards social inequality, in which individuals only consider their needs instead of society as a whole. The elite maintain an ever growing separation of class for they strive to maintain and expand resources. This results in restraints of the lower class from being a threat to the upper classes system of elite power   MY HELP HERE - Because such resources like women or what-have-you are limited, you must gather all the resources you can. I use women because that is a common thing that teen boys fight over. They would use drinking (parties, social events etc...) to get girls.   *functionalism ○ Functionalism Argues   § Society is a stable, orderly system characterized by consensus, where the majority of member share common beliefs, values, and behavioral norms.   § Society develop institutions (family, edu, economy, politics, religion), persist because they serve a useful function for the society   § If anything happens to one of these institution, all other parts are affected, system no longer functions properly   § Viewed society as analogous to the human body, need all parts to function well   § Social problems are the result of rapid social change that strains established ways of relating within and between groups   § Social problems typically seen as pathological (i.e not a normal state) and a temporary stage in evolution of society   § Crime persists because it serves functions in society, e.g. it helps to define norms.   MY HELP HERE - Functionalism is very cool because it tells the story of a running world, in which everything is in order. Everything functions because it set itself up to do so. When you have teen drinking, which is illegal in the US ( i assume you are from the US ), it goes against such functionality - against the norms. It's more about functioning as a society and keeping everything running smoothly rather than being illegal.   *symbolic interaction  § Symbolic Interaction   □ human action and interaction are understandable only through the exchange of meaningful communication or symbols   □ Principles of symbolic interactionism   1. Human beings act towards things on the basis of the meanings that things have for them   2. These meanings arise out of social interaction   3. Social action results from a fitting together of individual lines of action   □ humans are distinct from infrahumans (lower animals) because infrahumans simply respond to their environment (i.e., a stimulus evokes a response or stimulus -&gt; response) whereas humans have the ability to interrupt that process (i.e., stimulus -&gt; cognition -&gt; response)   □ Study the ""meaning""….Studying human/society requires getting at that ""meaning""   □ LIMITATIONS   ® Overlooks macro social structures (e.g., norms, culture) as a result of focusing on micro-level interations   MY HELP HERE - symbolic interaction allows humans to be humans. We interact in meaningful (symbolic) ways that define us as humans (not animals). Teens that get together in a social setting and drink, communicate, dance and interact in such ways, is a symbolic interaction because it defines us a humans. Another way to put it is: teen drinking is one way that teens act that can represent the human race as...well...human.  ",®

We as CC are very upset about this whole incident and wished to play such an important game much rather than having this happen. Alot of people us included spent alot of time preparing this event and setting up casts/streams and promotion and it´s shame that something like this happened. Also i don´t only blame Darn for this. We gave them the chance to get a merc and play the second map and when they left they stated on the server ""gg hope the spectors enjoyed this"". That kind of attitude sickens us. As its a rule where both teams have to agree on an increased fov I don´t see a reason to RQ the game if the enemy doesnt allow you to do so. After you ready up you agree to the terms of the game and that was a very childish and immature behaviour that lets the people that care about competitive TF2 look bad. ♥ Thanks for the support reddit .

t5_2qh13,r34xL,1369193610,"	 I believe that corruption, whether it be from police chiefs helping out friends, right up to the major centers of finance and government; represents the highest order of evil man can commit. For too long we have continued to live in what should be a modern world, where Men still have the highest percentage of power and women are still made to be second class citizens.    If this attack had happened in Australia, or the UK or the United states, those men would (depending on what state they lived in) would face minimums of ten years up to mandatory life. The disparity of justice among the 1st and the 3rd world is just one of the things that will keep the status quo how it is.    When the recent attack on the girl in the bus happened, many students and civilians stood up for what is right. My only hope is that it happens here too and that this girl does not receive the harsh treatment from peers, that seems to be common with this sort of thing. I wish her a successful career, lots of money and a bollywood star husband that showers her with flowers ever day♥ [EDIT]-&gt; Most of all i wish her justice, for the men who did this to be appropriately punished as they damn well should be.   Little Segue: First off i want to point out that the majority of Indian people are good, honest citizens of their country and whatever country they wish to reside in.    In Australia right now there are tensions among the Indian community and Australians. There have been several incidences of racism directed at Indians whether on holidays or permanent residences. The Indian community appears to be putting the onus of blame squarely on a ""racist Australia""    Now Australia has roughly 23 million residents. India has over a billion. So if we are intelligent and do not believe that all Indians are acid throwing, tourist assaulting and child raping pigs, we can make a figure for the Lowest Common Denominator, lets say 1%, so that is Ten million criminals (or just under half the Australian population). Now lets say only 1% of them go on holidays to other countries, that is still ten thousand criminals walking around in other countries of the world.    So if you want to put odds on why Australians may appear to be racist towards Indians, that is a fairly good reason.  Addendum: Merely pointing out the facts. Racism should not be tolerated, irregardless of the LCD's in the world.",♥

t5_2qh2p,trumpetofzion,1369201965,"MAY 7, 2013 REVELATIONS OF GOD: THE DEVIL AND THE FALLEN ANGELS HAVE BECOME THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL CREATURES, BECAUSE THE SALVATION AND ATONEMENT FOR THEM HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FOREVER! Please share and do not change © BC    Full view:  Hello, welcome! On May 7th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Charmella. I am a messenger angel of God.  Verily, for you there is yet the opportunity to be saved and atoned for, but we cannot maintain this of the fallen angels. For them there is not any opportunity for this anymore. The devil and the fallen angels have become the most miserable of all creatures, because the salvation and atonement for them have been cut off forever. Verily, the angels, who though in principle were created truly full of love by the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham, had left their own habitation, after satan with his army had to leave heaven, God's sanctuary, until the judgment on the great day will come. Verily, they shall be bound in everlasting bonds, and there's no return possible for them anymore.  Verily, as Yeshua, the Lord Jesus Christ, asks him to his name, who was possessed by demons in the country of the Gadarenes, he says 'legio'. This means 'legion'. With Mary Magdalene seven devils were cast out; it was awesome! Verily, Beelzebub is the name of satan.  Verily, if you have seen, what's happening around you, do you have to suffer and see what happens then?  Read aloud: Philippians 1, verse 8 to 10, and 1 Corinthians 6, verse 2 and 3, and 1 Corinthians 10, verse 9 and 10 and 13, and Ephesians 6, verse 10, and Revelation 3, verse 21, and James 4, verse 7 Philippians 1, verse 8 to 10 Here it is written: For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ. 1 Corinthians 6, verse 2 and 3 Here it is written: Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Don't you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?  1 Corinthians 10, verse 9 and 10 Here it is written: Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents. Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.  And verse 13 No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. Ephesians 6, verse 10 Here it is written: Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.  Revelation 3, verse 21 Here it is written: He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne. James 4, verse 7 Here it is written: Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, United States of America, hear!  Read aloud: Revelation 16, verse 18 to 21 Here it is written: There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, just this: Hennie H., repent! Or you will be punished by the Lord! I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  www.youtube.com/heiscoming12",©

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On February 22nd, 2013, Benjamin Cousijnsen was taken along in the Spirit. This is the report that follows.  Benjamin, Benjamin, wake up! Shalom Benjamin, fear not! I am the messenger angel of God, Rubeni. I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Follow me, God's beloved prophet. Benjamin said, ""It's like I'm sleepwalking, so sleepy and tired I am.""  Benjamin, spoke the messenger angel of God, you will be taken along to hell. ""What? Hell?"" Yes, hell, Benjamin. Thereof you wake up, huh? But fear not, you will return.  The messenger angel said, Many believe that there is no hell. In order to open your eyes, I ask you to grab your Bible, and to read along:  Revelations 20, verse 12 to 15 Read all this aloud. Here it is written: I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.  The messenger angel of God stood immediately with me in hell, Benjamin writes. A kind of walkway arose, and where we walked, the flames recoiled.  Benjamin shouted, ""Wow, I see all flames!"" The messenger angel Rubeni and I, Benjamin, walked on through the sea of flames. This text was passed on to me:  Exodus 14, verse 21 and 22 Read this for yourself.  Just like with Moses, the sea drew back, also this see of flames drew back for us!  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Tell whom you see in hell, Benjamin. ""I see men with white faces, with a kind of black star on their faces. And that one person has a very long bloody tongue. I don't know their names, I'm bad at remembering people's names."" The messenger angel of God spoke, I reveal the names to you... Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Tommy Thayer, Eric Singer, Ace Frehley, Peter Criss, Eric Carr, Vinnie Vincent, Mark St. John, Bruce Kulick. Benjamin, they are known in hell. This group was known as 'Kiss'. I heard them screeching and screaming horribly in the flames! The messenger angel of God pointed and said, Look over there! That is Prince Rogers Nelson. He is known as: singer 'Prince'. I asked, ""Whoever else is here in this place?"" I'll tell you what, said the messenger angel of God. This is Elton Hercules John, known as Elton John. Further one will encounter there Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone, and Hermanus Brood, and Elvis Aaron Presley, and Michael Philip Jagger, and Michael Joseph Jackson and Britney Jean Spears. ""May I ask you something, messenger angel Rubeni?"" Benjamin asked. ""Are all these people dead now, and all here in hell?""  The messenger angel of God said, Benjamin, I showed you the future prospect, if one does not repent. For some, it's now already too late, and these are here already.  Benjamin writes, This is what I saw even more around me... I saw that both the skin and the body, the flesh of the people, burned away down to the bone in hell in the flames. But afterwards everything just grew back, and just repeated all over again. I heard gnashing of teeth, I also heard: ""Jesus, help! I accept you in me now!""  I also saw, that there were artists in this huge hellfire, who were forced to dance and sing and jump to screeching, screaming, false-sounding, loud noises. Compare it with screaming, false-sounding electric guitars.  Remarkable also was, that I saw devilish beings, who had a bat-like head, while their body looked small, but almost human. Their claws looked like those of a scorpion, and they had a strong tail like that of a rat. These beings went through the flames back and forth, and I saw that some were even eating the artists. Later the Lord God revealed to me, that these people undergo a terrible sensation, as to be chewed up, digested, and be burnt in acid, after which the breakdown, followed by the stool, then after which everything recovers again, in order to keep repeating again from the beginning, forever and ever.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, read this aloud:  Matthew 23, verse 33, Matthew 5, verse 30, Matthew 23, verse 15, and Job 1, verse 6, 2 Corinthians 11, verse 14, and Revelation 18, verse 22 to 23 This I will read to you:............  send me email for complete text   www.youtube.com/heiscoming12",©

THE LORD PLACED HIM BACK AND TOTALLY HEALED HIM! AFTER 3 YEARS HE RECEIVED A HEAVENLY ANOINTING AND BECAME GOD'S END TIME PROPHET! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello and welcome, Shalom! On March 12th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.   At the end of this message you can also listen to a testimony of Marta, Benjamin's wife, of the things which she had experienced at home, of the presence of God's messenger angels.  On behalf of the Lord, this was asked of her, to testify of this, if she wanted.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.   Verily, verily, I tell you, I am who I am, and it is about Him, and not about me! It is about Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  Enoch was a righteous man, his eyes were opened by God Himself, and he saw God's revelations, visions, and was taken along, and saw the holy Heavens and the angels. If he would be in your time, and would tell you what he saw and experienced every day, you might be thinking: 'This man is a false prophet, a liar, or some crazy person'. Verily, verily, I tell you, Benjamin comes from the tribe of Benjamin, as well as among others Saul, also called Paul.  Also I say to you, as a messenger angel of God, Benjamin was destined and saw many revelations of God. Also as a child, Benjamin was protected by God's angels, who came already at that time.  Satan has often carried out an attack... In 1992, Benjamin got severely injured by a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the top down, and was 16 years out of his body. He was taken along into God's heavenly place, where he talked a lot with the Lord.  The Lord brought Benjamin back after 16 years, and Benjamin was placed back and totally healed! A time afterwards, Benjamin was consecrated as a prophet in heaven through different prophets, with heavenly oil, and thereafter the angels of God came. He is a simple, beloved prophet of God in the last days, and directly writes down everything, what the messenger angels of God are bringing, whether you believe it or not.  Jeremiah 32, verse 27 Read this aloud. Here it is written: Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too wonderful for me?  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Truly, if you listen to the messages, you will find out that we angels of God speak about Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and give Him the honor. A fallen angel would never be able to bring these messages! I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! and listen attentively to the messages.  Read aloud: Malachi 3, verse 1 Here it is written: Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes! says the LORD of hosts.   I am going to tell you now, what Marta's experiences are from early 2012    Marta writes,  Perhaps you wonder, what I, Marta, perceive of the many daily visits of the messenger angels in our home. After about 15 months, I have already gotten used to it, that we receive sometimes 2 or 3 messages per day from the messenger angels of God, coming by.  The messenger angels are representatives of God as it were, but they are humble and helpful, and adapt a very modest attitude. Even though I don't see them, because the messenger angel comes for the person, who receives the message, yet I even notice it by the quiet, peaceful atmosphere at home. They give all the honor to Christ Jesus Himself, and they also repeat this often in the messages, that we read back. They pass on everything word for word, but you know that already of course.  We have prepared a separate little room for the Lord and for the visits of the messenger angels of God - we also call it 'the little room of the Lord' - where Benjamin writes down all messages. If he is called, he's always going there. This was not so in the beginning, because then everything was intermixed together so to say: the household, the combining, the recording of the things at the table... And now we have that nice apart. The messenger angels also picked up immediately, namely that which you decided in your heart. When Benjamin is writing, I see through the glass top window above the door, when I walk upstairs, or at night when I walk to the toilet across the corridor, I see a beautiful warm light, that changes in intensity. But sometimes it is just visible in colors also; these are bright, soft colors. I call it loving colors, but we do not know them here. They only come close to the colors that we know, and yet different. Think just of a rainbow, which is actually what comes most close to these colors..........

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello! On December 16th, 2012, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am a messenger angel of God.  Luke 10, verse 12 I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.   The religion of the great holy religious leaders have signed a contract with different religions. They strive for a religion of ALL DIRECTIONS and one must obey this religion! Verily, verily, I tell you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, Islam is seen as the same faith, the Christians have. They call Yeshua: Isa, and call Him a prophet! Hear, what I tell you!  Matthew 3, verse 17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, This is my beloved Son, ""I repeat: This is my beloved Son,"" with whom I am well pleased.  Matthew 16, verse 16 and 17 Simon Peter answered, ""You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."" Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.  John 3, verse 18 He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Verily! John 3, verse 33 to 36 He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  Verily, verily, I tell you, I am a messenger angel of God, Marakai, Hear! Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is not a prophet! Benjamin Cousijnsen is. It is He, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, who raise the dead and Himself after three days. It is He who bore the sins on the cross in your place, in order to save you yet! Who cast out evil spirits and healed the sick, and did mighty miracles? And you call Isa a prophet? Who might Benjamin be then!?  John 1, verse 12 But as many as received him, ""Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ"", to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name.  Verily, read the Bible!  John 12, verse 49 For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  Beloved prophet of God, I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!   Note: Full text display for the deaf, hearing impaired and speakers of other languages... Use like Google Translate and bookmark it.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1369217433,"To pre-empt the inevitable flood of ""But dat's da Old Testamunt, hurr durr""...  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

I've wasted a lot of time arguing with creationists, and to be honest, I don't recall ever seeing anyone change their mind, although sometimes they'll concede some points and say they need to rethink some things.   I suspect a large fraction creationists simply don't think that rationally examining empirical evidence is the way to determine The Truth™. Doubting creationism is often only going to become even possible if they have broader doubts about the basis of their beliefs.  Perhaps gently responding to some of the common misconceptions creationists tend to have about how science works, what constitutes a theory, and what the theory of evolution involves in particular can't hurt, even if changing a mind in the short term is unlikely. Given that it's someone close to you, it's probably even more important to be patient, and not to present yourself in a way that might be perceived as condescending.

t5_2qh3l,_valtiel_,1369227627,"http://www.yatessom.co.uk/Attitude.html  Statistics show that:  â€¢	An 18-year-old driver is more than three times as likely to be involved in a crash as a 48 year-old. â€¢	One in five new drivers has a crash within six months of passing their test.   Younger drivers are likely to: Be over-confident  Young people quickly pick up the physical skills of driving and, as a result, feel they have mastered it and are subsequently very confident about their driving ability. This means young drivers may drive unsafely, but think that they are actually in control. Feel they are invincible  Many young people admit they often feel they are immortal and that they think crashes only happen to other people. Assess risks poorly  Although some risks on the road are easy to identify, there are some situations where the risks are not immediately obvious. It often takes experience to notice these hidden risks and due to inexperience, young people may be poor at assessing these risks. Research has shown inexperience to be a significant contributing factor to crash risk, particularly in relation to errors in attention, visual awareness, speed relative to conditions, hazard recognition and emergency manoeuvres. Take risks  Young people tend to take more risks than older people do. Roads are not the place to take risks, but younger drivers are sometimes unaware of how devastating the consequences of taking risks can be. For example, research has shown that young drivers are less likely than older drivers to cite speeding as a major cause of crashes, and when asked to rank a number of driving situations in order of risk, young drivers ranked speeding significantly lower in risk than did older drivers. It has also been suggested that one of the reasons young drivers attach less importance to the risk of speeding is they are overconfident in their control and recovery skills. Young drivers often take risks, believing they wonâ€™t get caught, or that nothing serious will happen to them. Research tells us that they are more likely to change their behaviour if they consider the following;  ",™

t5_2s0u3,Carns,1369229144,"Dan Pompei On the NFL 7:48 p.m. CDT, May 21, 2013  You have to be cautious about what you see from a football team when buds still are on the trees and pads still are in the lockers.  But if there is one of the Bears you should know about who's mostly unknown, it's Fendi Onobun.  There is no question the tight end has been an offseason standout. And if he performs as well in training camp as he has in the offseason, he will have a significant role on the team. And he will be an offensive weapon.  That might sound like a stretch if you know of Onobun's history.  He never played a snap of football in high school or in four years at Arizona. He was quite a basketball player, however. In fact, Rivals.com ranked him the 13th small forward prospect in the country as a high school senior.  Onobun didn't play much in his four seasons and transferred to Houston to play football in his fifth college year. He caught two passes, one for a touchdown.  Still, the Rams drafted him in the sixth round of the 2010 draft. He was cut the next year, the first of four times he would be over the next two seasons.  In December, Onobun signed with the Bears, his sixth NFL team.  So why should it be any different for him with the Bears than it was the Rams, Seahawks, Redskins, Jaguars or Bills?  Onobun finally might be at the point where he isn't looking for the basket anymore.  It also helps that the Bears offer opportunity. After Martellus Bennett, the depth chart is wide open.  ""My career definitely has been frustrating up to this point,"" Onobun said. ""I really feel this is the first team I've been a part of where I've been given an opportunity to flourish at what I'm good at and hone in on it.""  Quarterback Jay Cutler has been working with Onobun. He wouldn't be making that time investment if he didn't see something worthwhile.  ""Jay and Josh (McCown) are helping me with little things, things that aren't natural because I didn't grow up playing the sport,"" Onobun said.  Onobun also believes his basketball experience can be a benefit. Other basketball players who have made the transition to tight end include Antonio Gates and Jimmy Graham. Tony Gonzalez was a star basketball player in high school and a regular role player for California though it was a secondary sport for him.  ""I've had an opportunity to talk with Tony and Antonio, and have picked their brains,"" Onobun said. ""The biggest thing is to use your basketball skill set on the football field. … As far as making the reads, it's like basketball. If it's man, there's a man in front of you. If it's zone, the guy is going to be in space.""  Onobun has received the most advice from Bennett, who also was a basketball teammate of his at Alief Taylor High School in Houston. In fact, Bears defensive end Cheta Ozougwu also briefly played on the Taylor basketball team with Onobu and Bennett.  On that team, the 6-foot-6 Onobun was the center and the 6-6 Bennett the small forward.  ""He's one of my best friends,"" Onobun said. ""We grew up together, us being two of the premier athletes at the school. We pushed each other. We both knew we had futures in the sports world. We stayed close together, hung out together worked out together. He was a two-sport star. I was a basketball star. It's crazy that 10 years later we are on the same team.  ""The relationship helps with him being a six-year veteran. He helps me out a lot as far as understanding things, pointing out things I might not know as far as excelling at the position.""  The two also played on a travel team with Packers tight end Jermichael Finley.  At 263 pounds, Onobun has exceptional measurables, even better than Bennett's and Finley's. At his pro day in 2010, he ran a 4.45 40-yard dash, had a vertical jump of 371/2 inches, a broad jump of 11-1 and ran the 20-yard shuttle in 4.15 seconds.  What's more, he has soft hands.  If there is a question on him, it is blocking. Onobun acknowledges that has been ""the least natural thing"" for him.  ""It's a work in progress,"" Onobun said. ""I'm a willing blocker. It's just that it hasn't been one of my strong suits. But it's definitely improving.""  Onobun isn't on the Bears to block any more than Nate Robinson was on the Bulls to rebound. Onobun is on the Bears to do with Gonzalez, Gates and Graham do for their teams — catch passes.  If Onobun can catch passes in August like he has in May, he won't be known as a former basketball player anymore.  dpompei@tribune.com  Twitter @danpompei  Copyright © 2013 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC",©

t5_2qh3s,Brickmana,1369235822,"I wouldn't have apologized either. The movie is out, so you gotta commit to it and the decisions you made.  But there's no easy way to tackle the shame of sexing up entertainment for non-story purposes. This is franchise entertainment we're talking about and not hard sci fi like ""the good old days,"" whatever that means to older fans. Star Trek as a series tested the waters to see what kind of balance between philosophy and science and entertainment could reach mainstream audiences without being too boiled down or too alienating. I think the new series has found a good, but different balance. i'm okay with that actually.   I would argue that there is a reason for using a fair amount of sex appeal to get people into seats, especially for a super expensive spectacle movie. I would even say there's many attractive, youthful stars of both genders on screen--but it is kind of sad to see the stacked blonde get singled out for the exploitative underwear scene.   That's not my point though. I think Damon's apologies and my disappointment comes from a place where single-sided sex appeal is necessary to get people engaged in the plot and characters of a series that kind of always pushed for equality for a greater future. Seeing Alice Eve in her space undies is great but spits in the face of that in some minor but meaningful way. Seeing both Urban and Eve strip to their skivvies without gratuitous awe appeals to the masses. Not having characters or the audience literally take a three second boob break keeps things in line with the franchise's meaningful commentary about gender, sex, whatever.   Star Trek is a great, but currently under-utilized platform for making thoughtful, engaging commentary on society and humanity's place amongst the stars. The new series is awesome and entertaining but it moves too fast and pushes too hard to please to ask great questions or make great characters out of the entire ensemble or established universe. This feels like Awesome Space Adventure® and not Star Strek, because I could take the star trek elements out of the new series and it would still be great entertainment. To see the characters alive on screen is great though, so no one should complain. I'll just wait hopefully for a new entry that takes its time on something smaller, not just universe at stake kind of schlock.   The writer shouldn't apologize for the sex, but admit to using it as a crutch because his scenes go too fast for star trekky stuff.",®

I love the stream of consciousness style that Slacker takes on, but I was wondering where you managed to come up with some of the dialogue in the film.  The Scooby Doo bribery theory, for example, and the Madonna pap smear.  That’s some pretty wacky shit.  Did you just come up with that off of the top of your head?  Were you under the influence of any drugs at any time while writing the script?  What was your favorite movie to make?  I feel like being on set of Dazed and Confused would’ve been the best time ever.

IT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO THE SON OF GOD AND THE ANGELS &amp; REVELATIONS ABOUT THE FEMA CAMPS! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On January 18th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, I am the messenger angel of God, Sarachi.  Beloveds, it has been revealed to the Son, Yeshua, and to the angels of God! This day will be a very special day!  Revelation 19, verse 8 It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.  It will be a poignant and indescribably joyous event for those, who were patient, and are expecting Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and have accepted Him! It will be a very painful event for you, who are listening now, because you have rejected Jesus Christ. Yet it is not entirely too late for you, for it is written for you:  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, ""also on the cross, He went for you, in order to take your punishment upon Himself"", that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, the time is near! In North Korea 300,000 to 500,000 Christians get tortured. Obama adjusts the Arms Act, so that the prohibited weapons can be used in countries, where they do like to have these weapons! The antichrist likes to use children, in order to hide his true nature. Obama cares so much about people, that those camps are ready, with of American-made beheading machines, signed by the antichrist Obama! And these are already distributed by his order. So in North Korea many thousands are in Nazi-like FEMA punishment camps. These punishment camps are hidden, worldwide! The radical Islam is increasing rapidly, worldwide, and they persecute the Christians, as in Africa, Mali, Tanzania, Niger, Kenya, Uganda, America, North Korea, China... Worldwide one wants to exterminate the Christians!  Luke 21, verse 25 to 28 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.  Verily, let nothing prevent you from accepting Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, in your life! Now choose this day whom you want to serve. Get yourself ready to meet Him, because He'll come unexpectedly, and puts you to the test now!  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!  SHALOM!

I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Thunder, the messenger angel of God!  Verily, world, fear your mighty, mighty, almighty God, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham! If I am being sent, look forward to what He, the Almighty God, brings you. They call me Thunder, and there is thunder. They also call me the Destroyer of God in God's Kingdom. Verily,  Genesis 18, verse 24 What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are therein?  Verily, how often God's true end-time prophet, Benjamin Cousijnsen, spoke to you: 'Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand, make His paths straight!'  Truly, God's Kingdom of heaven has come very near! When your prophet say this, I would but listen, because oh woe, America, Korea, Iran, Turkey, China, Mexico, Suriname, Spain, Germany, Morocco, Indonesia, Belgium, Netherlands, Philippines, Russia, and you who listens, I bring you destruction!  Hebrews 12, verse 14 Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord.  God hates your idolatries; only the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham, Yahweh, is holy! And also your world stars are not holy nor should they be worshipped. You worship everything!  Deuteronomy 7, verse 21 You shall not be affrighted at them: for the LORD your God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. Deuteronomy 7 verse 26 Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.  Verily, listen! Who is righteous? Repent, headstrong, obstinate, haughty, stubborn peoples! The time is very near! Why is your heart locked for the Son of God, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ? He does not force you, He is a Lord, and waits, that you open your heart to Him.  He would most like ramming your door of your heart open, because:   John 3, verse 16 says this: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  It is about your salvation! Invite Him into your heart, before it really is too late. Who now allows the Most High to stand outside the door? You will truly regret it. My name is Thunder, the Destroyer of God. See, what I am going to bring you on behalf of the Almighty God. I obey only the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. Oh woe, even the floodgates are going to open again!  The redeemed in Christ must be pure within, and holy of walk, because unexpectedly there is chaos worldwide! For His beloved in Yeshua, Jesus Christ, have suddenly been taken away. Get yourself ready!  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

LISTEN &amp; READ WHAT JESUS CHRIST SAID TODAY, HE IS THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY! Please share and do not change © BC     Full view:  Hello, welcome! May 8, 2013  Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, my name is Rafaël, the messenger angel of God.  Follow me, Benjamin. ""Right, Rafaël. But now that I've risen from my chair, I don't see myself. What now? Who then writes everything down?"" Benjamin, thus it is written. Read these golden letters on the wall. ""What language is that? I cannot read this, Rafaël."" This is Aramaic, read it! ""Okay, now I can read it... Jeremiah 32, verse 27 Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too wonderful for me?"" Benjamin, well done! So, follow me, in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I followed Rafaël, and the wall with the window of the bedroom slid as a sliding door to the right, and I thought: 'Things must not get weirder'. And immediately Rafaël answered: Could something be impossible for Yeshua? Come and jump!  Rafaël jumped, and I jumped after Rafaël, without a parachute... And we flew over our garden, and from the air I saw the pond and the trees becoming smaller. I flew just under Rafaël, and at different places in the sky there was a kind of army-like, armored angel of God present.  Look, Benjamin, there is the sea of Tiberias. We landed there... I had no idea why we were there. Okay, prophet Benjamin, my mission is accomplished! Wait here. ""Hey! But wait! Are you going away then?"" Yes, that's right! ""And what do I do here?"" Waiting, Benjamin! Suddenly Rafaël flew away... the smile certainly drained from my face.  But immediately I heard: Shalom, my beloved! Peace be to you, as the Father has sent me. It is I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! Look, Benjamin, I have made a fire with fish and bread. Yeshua, Jesus Christ, stretched out His arm and gave me a piece of fish on a leaf, with a piece of bread, and I ate. And it tasted delicious. Yeshua spoke, I have My memories here with My disciples, Benjamin.  Verily, verily, I tell you, I could tell you a lot, like: many children of My flock blow along with all winds, with apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, and think so richly to be blessed, even by the Pope with his bent, occult cross: the symbol of Lucifer.  Verily, Have I not revealed to you: Benjamin Cousijnsen is My beloved prophet? Do you believe or not, that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? And that the Father speaks to you, and that He is with Me and is in Me?    Read aloud: Luke 13, verse 6 to 9 Here it is written: He spoke this parable. ""A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?' He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'""  Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, spoke further,  Many Christians do not blow along with the Holy Spirit, but with the authorities and powers of the darkness in the world! Verily,  Read aloud: Ephesians 6, verse 11 and 12 Here it is written: Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, spoke further,  Above all, I tell you, Seek first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and pray and you will be given, seek and you shall see it, knock and the door will open. I talked about the fig tree. Where do your fruits come forth from? From the Maitreya spirit, or from some leader?  Surely, the darkness with its works has increased on May 5, 2013. Verily, satan is not a fairy tale, so is also not the antichrist Obama. Do not underestimate their works! Behold, there's Rafaël. Say this all, what I said! I am the only Way.  Read this also: John 8, verse 12, and John 12, verse 39 to 41 John 8, verse 12 Here it is written: Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, ""I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."" ",©

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On May 1st, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this message of God to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Verily, verily, I tell you, I greet you in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I am the messenger angel of God, Chelon.  Through all centuries there have been people in church, who were really afraid of everything that was new. There was once a scholar, who said that the earth was not a flat surface, but a round ball, and that one did not need to be afraid. And that one would not fall over the edge, if one happened to get very far from home. Verily, verily, I tell you, some church people were so angry that they shouted, ""Away with him! He interferes with the creation, and that is from God!""  Genesis 1, verse 1 and 2 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.  These church people didn't realize at that time, that their idea of the earth might not turn out to be God's idea.  And that God has put a healthy dose of curiosity in each human, especially in every scholar, through which one is going to investigate how the earth and the stars, the sun and the moon are put together, and how one is able to cure a disease, by means of a good medicine, etcetera. Listen, in this way, the atomic power has been discovered by the people. Verily, listen!  Read aloud: Genesis 1, verse 6 to 7, and 1 Thessalonians 5, verse 21 to 24 I'll start with Genesis 1, verse 6 to 7 Here it is written: And God said, ""Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."" And God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.  1 Thessalonians 5, verse 21 to 24 Here it is written: Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good. Abstain from every form of evil. May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he who calls you, who will also do it. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  You must keep that which is good and run away from evil.  Now that atomic power is a good example of good use and misuse. With atomic power you are able to heat houses, to let ships sailing. In conclusion, to use it for everything, where energy force is needed for. But you are also able to make an atomic bomb, that destroys all the beautiful things, far into the perimeter of the place where it falls.   With nuclear power one wants with spaceships to Mars. One wants there a permanent basis. Bricks can be made there on the spot for habitation. Obama, the antichrist, is waiting for more favorable times to go to Mars. Verily, his plan is ready, his flight plan!    Read aloud: Revelation 20, verse 1 to 3, and verse 10 Revelation 20, verse 1 to 3 Here it is written: I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time.  And verse 10 Here it is written: The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, I'm going now; no power and no might is greater and stronger than that of Him, who is coming, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM! God bless   Note: Full text display for the deaf, hearing impaired and speakers of other languages...

I followed the messenger angel, Thunder, down the stairs, which as always, also now creaked under our feet.  Having walked right through the front door, yet two angels of God were waiting for us in the street. It turned out to be the angels of God, Kadesa and Hamiël. Thunder said, that Kadesa had been yet with me on April 10, and Hamiël on April 24. I was kidding and said, smiling, ""Am I that important?"" But, the angel of God, Thunder, said: You are very important, prophet Benjamin.  We took off... quickly and effortlessly I too was being pulled by God's will and power. The angel of God, Thunder, flew beneath me, and at the left and right of me the angels of God, Kadesa and Hamiël, flew. Once I was told that the span width of the wings of the messenger angels of God is like that of a small glider, and it made me remember this. We flew far away, and I saw the clouds and the many stars, and the earth below becoming smaller.  Above the earth, in the airspace, the messenger angel Thunder spoke: The following is now revealed... Verily! Each time the fallen angels attack the earth. I was surprised by everything that I saw around me. I saw innumerable angels! The messenger angel, Kadesa, said: I talked yet about the chariots of God, do you know it again?  Read aloud: Psalm 68, verse 17 Here it is written: The chariots of God are twenty thousand, and thousands of thousands. So far.    I saw beautiful winged horses, where angels were sitting on. They had a kind of sword in their hand, where a kind of flash of lightning came from. I saw many angels of God, who stood together as a contiguous chain in the airspace above Israel.  I saw fiery chariots, and also many UFOs. And there were UFOs surrounded with a bright firelight, and other UFOs looked dark. These were huge ships, which were shooting up. I also saw many, human looking, birdlike demonic bats, fighting against the messenger angels of God, who are protecting Israel. I asked, ""Why do they attack exactly Israel?"" The messenger angel of God, Hamiël, replied,  Benjamin, the fallen angels hate Israel, because Israel is carried and protected by the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!  They have discovered miles deep cracks, leading to the Golden Gate, also called the Gate of Mercy. In 1945 this gate was bricked up by the Muslims, because one is informed, and does not want that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, will pass there through. The Muslims, the Islamic authorities, had done this in order to shut Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, out.    Read aloud: Job 11, verse 7, and John 3, verse 16 Job 11, verse 7 Here it is written: Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?  John 3, verse 16 Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Prophet Benjamin, satan wants Israel, and wants only through them one religion. The fireballs out of the hands of the fallen angels cannot cause damage, because one is more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus, Yeshua HaMashiach!  Read aloud: Revelation 22, verse 6 and 7, and Revelation 9, verse 9 I'll start with Revelation 9, verse 9 Here it is written: They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.  Revelation 22, verse 6 and 7 Here it is written: He said to me, ""These words are faithful and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon."" ""Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.""  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, Benjamin, you must go back, come! So we flew back again.  The messenger angel of God, Thunder, said: Nothing will stop Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.

t5_2qh2p,trumpetofzion,1369261526,"Published on May 20, 2013 by pengharapan05  THE ALMIGHTY GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB IS SPEAKING TODAY ABOUT HIS ORIGINAL PLAN WITH MUSIC. THE LORD IS SHARING THIS INFO, IN ORDER TO SHAKE YOU AWAKE! I AM COMING VERY CLOSE NOW! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On May 19th, 2013, the angel of the Lord brought on this important prophetic revelation of God to prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, God's beloved simple prophet! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Gidori. I am sent forth with this message.  Verily, it started this way...  Read aloud: Psalm 95, verse 1 to 4 and verse 6, and Psalm 96, verse 1 to 9, and Psalm 22, verse 3 I'll begin with Psalm 95, verse 1 to 4 Here it is written: Oh come, let's sing to the LORD. Let's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation! Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let's extol him with songs! For the LORD is a great God, A great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.  And verse 6 Oh come, let's worship and bow down. Let's kneel before the LORD, our Maker. Psalm 96, verse 1 to 9 Here it is written: Sing to the LORD a new song! Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Sing to the LORD! Bless his name! Proclaim his salvation from day to day! Declare his glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples. For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens. Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Ascribe to the LORD, you families of nations, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts. Worship the LORD in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.  Psalm 22, verse 3 Here it is written: But you are holy, You who inhabit the praises of Israel.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, the origin of music comes from God! God's plan is, with music, to worship and praise Him with shouts of joy. Even before Genesis 1 there was already been made music in heaven. Satan was once a master of music. By pride, haughtiness, rebellion and disobedience he rebelled against God.  Read aloud: Isaiah 14, verse 10 to 14, and Isaiah 28, verse 13 to 17 Isaiah 14, verse 10 to 14 Here it is written: They all will answer and ask you, ""Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like us?"" Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you. How you have fallen from Heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, ""I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!"" Isaiah 28, verse 13 to 17 Here it is written: Therefore shall the word of the LORD be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. Why hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem: Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: therefore thus says the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone of sure foundation: he who believes shall not be in haste. I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, satan, also called Lucifer, was an anointed cherub; his appearance, his beauty, was a covering, which was to be found around God. Because of his rank, his position, he was very close to God. Lucifer covered himself with countless valuables, such as precious stones. And with these he captured the light of God. Therefore, the name of Lucifer also in Latin means: 'Lightbearer'. He went before all the angels, and led the worship by singing and music. He was a real great worship leader of God! When Lucifer went back, as he had captured even more light from God, then he went to the place where a lot of angels were. And when they saw that light of God, they began to worship God on the spot. How jealous he was of God!    Full text will be posted soon on: Endtimeprophecy2012-2013  www.youtube.com/heiscoming12",©

Isaiah 60, verse 1 and 2, and verse 18 to 20 Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.

By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.  Verily, Pray for Israel! Thus speaks the Lord.  Revelation 15, verse 4 Who wouldn't fear you, Lord, And glorify your name? For you only are holy. For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your judgments are made manifest.  Behold!

My best advice is research what you're looking for through google scholar, pubmed, ebsco host, or find journals that address nutritional considerations and strengthening. I don't understand the whole being tall argument because your limbs are still in similar proportion to your trunk as everyone else. Your muscles should also be longer since their origins and insertions are no different than any other sized person. Your center of mass is still the same as everyone else.The only argument to be made is deadlifting, since the weights you are lifting don't change diameter just because you're tall.

They don't charge for buses, multiple passengers, zero emission vehicles, and motorcycles.    &gt; I-15 Express Lanes: To participate, solo drivers must have a prepaid FasTrak account and transponder properly installed on their windshield when they use the Express Lanes.

Carpoolers drive for free on the I-15 Express Lanes.    Source: http://fastrak.511sd.com/fastrak/i-15-express-lanes-faq  The I-15 is the ONLY ""toll"" road in San Diego. And it's only the HOV lane that is tolled. Nothing else is. It's not like Dallas where EVERY fucking highway is tolled... which is stupid. It should be free or hugely reduced for motorcycles. There's pretty much no advantage to riding anywhere other than California it looks like :(    Either way, to get to work I don't even have to take a highway. Which kind of sucks. I actually like longer commutes, it's the highlight of my day in California (constantly perfect weather with twisty, always traffic free commutes thanks to lane splitting), but I'd imagine I'd hate it in Texas, and would likely lane split anyways. One bonus of living in Texas is free gym memberships in most cities in Dallas, since Texas is one fat ass state (at least Plano pays for your gym membership). Probably all those Dr. Pepper floats...    In CA you get to go in the HOV lane, 0 tolls (if you're in San Francisco it's free there too - so are the toll roads in LA like the 94), and lane splitting.     Maybe I can go try to organize the AMA in the area to see if they can get something together to ditch the tolls on motorcycles and maybe allow lane splitting.  ",®

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PASSES ON THIS MESSAGE, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND COME TO CHRIST, YOUR ONLY SAVIOR! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On December 30th, 2012, the angel of the Lord, the messenger angel of God, brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Rinearinda. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Mark 3, verse 23 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can satan cast out satan?  Verily,  Luke 10, verse 18 And he said unto them, I beheld satan, ""in Hebrew: baraq, spoke the angel of the Lord"", as lightning fall from heaven.  2 Corinthians 11, verses 14 and 15 And no wonder, for ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord,"" even satan masquerades as an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ""taken over, the angel of the Lord said,"" ministers also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.  Isaiah 14, verse 12 to 14 How you have fallen from Heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! ""You play a game with the world! spoke the angel of the Lord"". You said in your heart, ""I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!"" Verily,  Matthew 24, verse 25 to 26 Behold, I have told you beforehand. If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the desert,' ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord"", don't go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,' ""this chameleon, said the angel of the Lord"", don't believe it. ""It is satan personally! said the angel of the Lord"".  Matthew 24, verses 27 and 28 For as the lightning, ""Barack Obama, spoke the angel of the Lord"", comes forth from the east, and shines even unto the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures be gathered together.  Verily, Obama came from the East, in order to make a career, and this is now the fallen lightning! In secret much is prepared now, so that one will assume the 'solution' of Obama en masse and with open arms: the number of the beast, 666! Also, many gallows for the FEMA camps has been transferred worldwide, from America, signed by... Obama!    Also, the New World Order has had meetings worldwide, together with the royal house and some of the government and other leaders! Verily,  James 5, verse 7 to 9 Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, ""blow not along with all winds. Truly, he is the prophet! spoke the angel of the Lord"", for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.   Verily, you there, Jesus Christ has everything ready for His children already. The God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham has indicated, that His Son will soon know the point of time and the hour!   Matthew 11, verse 28 Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.  Benjamin, January 30, you become older. In heaven one is always having his birthday, and one has eternal life, one does not know an old age.  I'm going now, God's beloved prophet, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

t5_2s3q7,Lippuringo,1369282642,"I just bought Arma and meet serious FPS problems. I use i5@750, 4gb RAM and GTX 650 1gb.  So how i improve my FPS:  1. Forget about ""High settings = huge FPS loss"". Arma utilize very much CPU than GPU. I read that, for example, if you put Shadows on Low they will utilize CPU power, while High settings will utilize GPU power. Something like that. So try to manipulate your config in Low-High settings depending on your GPU and CPU, so you could maximize output from your system. Also you can turn off shadows (much usefull in combat) and post processing, tun off AA and put in PPAA filtering FXAA (SMAA doesn't give much better look but gives less FPS) for better picture. And always use same Texture resolution as your Screen resolution which doesn't give you huge FPS loss but gives you much better picture. If you need, just lower your screen resolution.  2. You can start game with parameters (right click on game in steam, properties, launch parameters) for multi-core processors: -cpuCount=4 -exThreads=7 -noSplash (for quad core without Hyper Threading). More info (copy-paste):  &gt; These settings are only set up for the OP's machine and COULD POTENTIALLY DAMAGE YOUR MACHINE IF IT HAS LOWER SPECS THAN OP. Here are some proper instructions: 1. Go to Steam Library 2. Go to ""Arma 3"" Right Click then select ""Properties"" 3. Select ""Set Launch Options"" 4. Copy and paste the correct launch command line below to what your system is setup for and click ""OK"".  &gt;For AMD CPU users: AMD Dual Core with 4GB System Ram: ""-noSplash -cpuCount=2 -high"" AMD Quad Core with 4GB Ram: ""-noSplash -cpuCount=4 -high"" AMD Six Core with 4GB Ram: ""-noSplash -cpuCount=6 -high"" AMD Eight Core with 4GB Ram: ""-noSplash -cpuCount=8 -high""  &gt;If your running more than 8GB Ram then apply this to the end of the launch line: ""-maxMem=8192"" This will allow your game to utilize 8GB system Ram instead of 4GB.  &gt;Intel CPU: For Hyperthreaded CPU's such as a Quad Core you will apply this: -cpuCount=8 This will enable your Hyperthreads on your CPU so your CPU will act as an eight core when running Arma 3. If you are running a Hyperthreaded Six Core then: -cpuCount=12 If you are running a Hyperthreaded Eight Core or Eight Core Xeon then apply this: -cpuCount=16 If you are running just a non Hyperthreaded CPU such as a Quad Core then select ""4"" instead of ""8"" same for a Dual Core you will select ""2"" instead of ""4"". All AMD CPU's are NOT Hyperthreaded so Hyperthreaded options is highly not recommended as this can cause system failure or damage. I will not be responible for system failure and damage if you choose to select more cores then you have on your command line!  &gt;-high: makes your operating system prioritize services and processes to run your game better but this can cause system failure and instability if you dont have a good running system. If you Overclock this can cause system instability. -noSplash: disables startup videos and advertisements. -cpuCount=#: enables extra CPU cores and Hyperthreads. -maxMem=#: when set to ""6144"" (6GB) and up lets your game use more system Ram then 4GB. Do not set to higher than 4GB if you dont have at least 8GB. You can set to ""8192"" (8GB) if you have 12GB+ Ram.  © http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722097793772/?l=russian#c864961722098643748   ",©

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1369290579,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

He rescued a kitten after he heard her plaintive ""meow"" under the floor of a building under construction.  Named Sizi, she sat on his desk as he wrote, often falling asleep on his left arm. During these times Dr. Schweitzer, who was left-handed, wrote prescriptions with his right hand. This went on reportedly for 23 years. Another cat, Piccolo, slept on papers stacked on Dr. Schweitzer's desk; if someone needed the papers, they were required to wait till the cat awoke. Schweitzer once said: ""There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.""   EDIT: Memory augmented by Google®.",®

Prospective members are recruited using a combination of random digit dial and address-based sampling techniques that cover virtually all (non-institutional) resident phone numbers and addresses in the United States. Those contacted who would choose to join the panel but do not have access to the Internet are loaned computers and given Internet access so they may participate.  &gt;The sample therefore includes a representative cross-section of American adults – irrespective of whether they have Internet access, use only a cell phone, etc. Key demographic variables were weighted, post survey, to match US Census Bureau norms.  http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/files/Climate-Policy-Support-April-2013.pdf",®

If defensive fire dropped the MCC's shields before the Relays were destroyed the attackers would loose immediately and retreat.  However, as soon as the Relays were destroyed the game moved to Phase 2.  In Phase 2, the redline opens up allowing the attackers to approach and enter the Outpost on the other side of the map initially under the control of the defenders.  The outpost has a larger arrangement of Null Canons which will cause the MCC to lose HP faster during Phase 2.  The attackers must capture the Null Canons or their MCC will be outright destroyed.

That's the same graphics chipset that sits in just about all entry-level laptops and it's just not that good at running games.  Tweak other settings until you figure out what gets the smoothest gameplay for you.  Install Optifine, turn down your view distance to normal or short, set graphics to simple and turn off fancy lighting, water, lava and redstone animation.  On a similar (older in fact) laptop, I get around 20fps on DW20 1.4.7.  It still gets clunky in complex areas, though.     (edit to add:  what you're experiencing is *not* 'lag'.

t5_2qioo,TNightster,1369363753,"Per their specs, the N300 has a service called ""ReadySHARE® USB Storage Access"". I have no experience with this service, so I'm not sure if there is a native web interface into the USB storage, or if you can browse to the IP of the router and it will display the USB storage.  Either way, could easily host an SSID using DHCP to provide IP's to your wireless nodes. Assuming it is no connected to other networks, they would be isolated to the router and other wireless devices connected to the same router. If you wanted to connect it to another network (so you could remotely admin the device) but not allow them access to the internet, etc, then set your DNS provided by your router to something invalid like 1.2.3.4.   Build your website on your USB just as you would on any web host. Save your ""home"" page as index.html. I'm sure if you browse to the IP of your router, you will get the router admin page. But hopefully there is some IP\USBPATH url you can browse to which would read your USB and load the index.html page. The functionality will depend on the operation of the router.  Another option could be to take an old PC/laptop, run a web server on that machine (anything native or free would work) and then connect that to your router. So the router provides wireless connectivity, but the PC provides your web host. Probably more options for functionality there.  Good luck.  B",®

t5_2r74m,FlyingShisno,1369366575,"Like I said in your last post, if you enjoyed the game then it wasn't a mistake. Difficulty and realism seems to be a lot of peoples focus, which Complete lightened a bit, with gun balancing and everyone less squishy. I don't see a point in regretting something you enjoyed  Misery is a pretty sweet mod though. My computer isn't too powerful, but it can run Misery. It increases graphics, and makes the game far more realistic. Food is more scarce, though not impossible, and both you and enemies take realistic damage, so a few well placed bullets will down anyone. This of course  makes things a lot more difficult. Plus it adds a bunch of other items and tweaks. It has a pretty big update coming Soon™, so I've decided just to wait for that.  OcedMyToaster has a Let's Play of Misery, if you want to watch it. He's on the sidebar.  Personally, I chose Complete for my first runs. I didn't see much difference between the two. With Pripyat, there's not a lot different between Complete and Vanilla, so you can skip complete if you *really* want to jump on the hate bandwagon.  [Clear Sky Reloaded](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-cs-reloaded) is an alternative, which mostly fixes bugs and improves graphics and sounds.  **Edit 1:** Forgot to add, I *really* recommend Misery. Along with what I mentioned above, the weather, the scarcity of ammo and food, how easy it is to kill and be killed, adds **a lot** to the atmosphere. I like to jump between games a lot, and Misery was able to pull me in and make me care about my character *extremely* fast. It's an incredible mod.  **Edit 2:** Also, if your interested, Complete for SoC has an optional add-on that makes bullet damage more realistic, similar to Misery. [You can find it here](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009/downloads/sc-realistic-weapons-add-on)  **Edit 3:** Sorry for *another* edit. I decided to try out the LURK mod, and it's great. It's kinda like Misery for SoC. A lot more weaponry is available from the beginning, since enemies will start carrying them from the beginning. Haha, I was surprised when I saw a bandit carrying a PPSh on the first mission. It also has the realistic damage, and the guns are balanced more than Complete. It's a great alternative to Complete. I'm not sure which I like better, especially when you add the realistic gun damage add-on to Complete.",™

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome to this very important message, on January 16th, 2013!  Shalom, beloved prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, my name is Gabriël.  As I, the messenger angel, announced the birth, so I, Gabriël, announce you, the soon Return of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! I am the messenger angel of God, Hear, hear, hear! Behold, I am the voice crying - Gabriel, who cries in the universe and on the Earth: Prepare yourself!  Matthew 27, verse 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.  For three hours it was very dark.  Mark 15, verse 25 It was the third hour, and they crucified him.  Verily, Emanuel, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, He, the King of kings, who conquered death, is truly coming back very soon with might and power and glory!  Matthew 25, verse 13 Watch therefore, ""to you has been said"", added the messenger angel of God, for you don't know the day nor the hour.   The God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham has everything ready now.  Matthew 24, verse 27 For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.  Luke 17, verse 26 to 37 Read this aloud. Here it is written: As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all. It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. Remember Lot's wife! Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left. There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left. Two men shall be in the field; the one will be taken, and the other will be left."" They answering, asked him, ""Where, Lord?"" He said to them, ""Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.""   The messenger angel of God spoke further, Benjamin, those who are pure, let them rejoice and prepare! If you are firmly anchored to the world, and are one with the world, and not in Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, because of your sins, you will never get to see God's Kingdom! Choose, whom you want to serve today, and turn away from the world!  The hour and the day has now been revealed to the Son, and the angels of God! Nobody is allowed to take a part away from God's Words from the prophecy, and change it, only the Editor and Writer, God Himself!  Luke 17, verse 18, and Matthew 24, verse 12 and 13 Here it is written: Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?  Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, Jesus, Yeshua, is coming very soon now!  Hebrews 13, verse 15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  John 3, verse 7 and 8 and 16 Here it is written: Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again. The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Read also aloud: 1 John 2, verse 4 to 6 Here it is written: One who says, ""I know him,"" and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him. But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most assuredly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him: he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Benjamin, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, is already for so long homesick for His children, and has given so many opportunities to the world!

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On January 14th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, I am Arodai, the messenger angel of God. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Benjamin, the fallen angels are superior extraterrestrial higher developed devilish technological angels. Their appearance is as an observable beautiful angel of light. These false angels master the linguistics, and are highly gifted in flawless English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese and many other languages. They have remarkable UFOs transport equipment. Also, they try to stand close to the Almighty with their knowledge.    Also, there have been taken place many today's encounters with the antichrist Obama. The involvement with Earth is enormously! Obama is also telepathically connected with these fallen angels of satan.  Benjamin, between Mars and Jupiter is one planet, where many fallen angels are.  And also in Mexico, in the sea, a transport base for UFOs is located. The government remains as quiet as the grave about the fallen angels! The antichrist and the pope and the Muslim Brotherhood have already been in touch and made plans and signed them. They want the fallen angels to reveal and show themselves! This is done already.  Ephesians 6, verse 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.  Many Christians often forget to ask for protection. Read these scriptures aloud: Romans 13, verse 12 The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.  Isaiah 54, verse 17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says the LORD.  Ephesians 6, verse 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, verily,  2 Samuel 22, verse 31 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.   Benjamin, some Christians want God to do everything for them, without doing anything themselves. They are still just babies, who have it all their own way. Wake up there! God is very holy! God just wants you to fight against it. Use God's armor, cover yourself, Christian warriors, under the Blood of Jesus Christ, and defeat this chameleon. Come, stand on it, crush its head in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Thus there are many, who put aside the Holy Spirit, and just keep complaining, why God did not help them!  Job 5, verse 8 and 9 But as for me, I would seek God, To God would I commit my cause; Who does great things that can't be fathomed, Marvelous things without number.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, stand in His strength, and thank Him, who belongs all honor and worship! Amen.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! said the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM!

t5_2s3qj,hak8or,1369373922,"For people who want more proof this is a scam, lets throw some layman science at this and see just how much bounces back.  Lets look at the box of this Frostbit thing. https://cryoniks.com/#!/app/frostbit/  Now, we all have seen how large the heatsinks are for the 10 Ghash/s cards from asicminer, right? They are quite large, and even have fans to cool them. This machine apperntally does 100x the hash rate, so we can safely assume it gives off at least ten times the heat. To give off that heat fast enough so that the temperature does not rise to burning temperatures, you need to shift it to another medium, be it air, water, or even liquid nitrogen, faster than it is generated. On this box, we do not see any sort of radiators, heatinks, air holes, fans, or even seems for air to flow through. How on earth will they radiate heat quick enough?!  They are for some reason using liquid nitrogen somehow to cool the chips, but then you have to think, hm, well, the heat does not just dissapear, as that would defy a good bit of laws regarding physics, and more specifically, violate conservation of energy, unless of course they are using a patent pending process of turning energy into raw matter as per E=MC^2! Don't forget, that the very act of circulating liquid nitrogen is an energy intensive process, so you are injecting more energy into the loop, causing even more heat. Not to mention, it takes a very sexy compressor to change Nitrogen from gas at 1 ATM to a high enough pressure to make it turn into liquid. Such a compressor is very large, very expensive, very heavy, and uses massive amounts of energy.  &gt;Drawing Nitrogen gas directly from the environment, the FrostBit™ Cryonic System features nano-isolating **membranes specifically designed to reject other smaller atmospheric gases**.  This does exist actually and is not that crazy. It is used in things like (very rarely) gas masks for example. Such technology is also used in specifically situations exactly like this, when you want to pump a gas out of another mixture of gasses so you can compress that gas for either storage or to liquefy it, often in academic settings. Howe ever, it is not called a ""Nano-isolating Membrane"", but I sadly forgot the name and a quick google does not give me anything. Hopefully someone else can chime in and say it.  &gt;After assembly, each unit is injected with specially formulated acoustically and thermally insulating foam ensuring cool and quite operation.   Not sure why you want to make everything thermally insulated in there, especially such a compressor. Isn't the point of this LN2 magic to help get heat out of the unit anyways? Can't do that when everything is thermally insulated.  &gt;Support loads for the internal structure are rated 30 times expected working load conditions protecting your investment from accidental damage due to improper working loads.   How big is this thing?! You don't need ""support loads"" engineering for something the size of three cubic feet at most while weighing less than a hundred pounds, unless you are making this out of paper mache, toothpicks, straws, and tissue paper.  &gt;Additionally, the heavy-duty compressors are thermally and acoustically insulated to ensure smooth and quite operation year-round.  Again, thermally insulating a compressor at such work loads is a very sad face no no. That heat will be injected into the cooling loop and therefore increasing the temperature of your chips. There is good reason why fridges and AC's have air holes or vent seems right where the compressor is, to cool it.  &gt;We’ve taken ASIC processing to the next level with our patent pending ASIC+ Cryonic Architecture™ featuring select low-temperature superconducting materials.  And how much do you figure it costs to set up a chip fab to use exoitc materials? A normal fab capable of 110 nm costs millions upon millions of dollars, using standard materials. And these people quietly built such a fab, all by themselves, out of nowhere? If it was indeed this easy, Intel and TSMC would have been using such technology for years by now. Not to mention needing the know-how of a good bit of PHD's in material sciences and physics. We are talking stuff that if were true, would be very ground breaking and have many applications for customers who are willing to pay a pretty penny, such as the DOD and space programs, yet we do not see anything like this yet, so it probably has yet to happen.  &gt;We use custom-built condensers featuring environmentally inert **Helium** Compression Technology to rapidly cool and condense collected dry nitrogen gas into high-purity liquid nitrogen to directly cool our **processors**.  What has Helium have to do with this? And how are they using it to rapidly cool and condense nitrogen? But here is a very key thing that shows just how little they understand what this mining business is, their use of the word processors. Never, not once, have the mining chips been called processors, anywhere, instead they are called asics, and for good reason. They are just brute forcing hashes, nothing more, nothing less. There is little to no processing involved. I personally feel that this is the dead giveaway.   &gt;Cryoballsacks, Inc. guarantees to meet and surpass U.S EPA, CPSC, and FCC Suggested Product Safety Guidelines on lead and mercury use as well as pre-screening our vendors for responsible resource procurement practices to ensure they meet our strict criteria for safe carbon emission standards &amp; sound** mineral** procurement policies.  I am quite sure that you need to meet a no mercury or very low mercury regulation regardless, if you want to sell it in the USA. Also, what do minerals have to do with anything? There are no minerals involves in this, anywhere.  &gt;During the first 24 hours, Nitrogen gas from the environment will be collected and stored within leaving a slightly Oxygen rich environment. NEVER run your FrostBit™ Cryonic Bitmining units running near an open flame. See the provided Safety &amp; Maintenance Guide for more information.  If the nitrogen being sucked out of the air quickly part was true, then they are actually right here. Less nitrogen in the air, which currently takes up about 3/4 of all air (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth), which result in much more oxygen being in the area, which would result in a very dangerous situation. After all, this is how a few of the Apollo astronouts died during a test, they had an oxygen rich enviorment during testing, which resulted in a massive fire, burning them all to death or asphyxiating them. And too much oxygen as well as too little nitrogen can kill you, hence why divers always keep an eye on how much O2 and Nitrogen they have left. Too much of either one results in death.  &gt;But keep in mind that the system must go through a liquid “purge” that might take up to 6 hours for the stored liquid Nitrogen to evaporate.  Liquid nitrogen evaporates very quickly, but if we were to play devils advocate, they could be doing this to prevent nitrogen building in an area, therefore keeping the air breathable by someone nearby. But still, why do you have to get rid of the LN2 when moving it? What difference does it make if you are moving it or not for a closed LN2 cooling loop? Nothing.   &gt;CAN I USE MY FROSTBIT™ CRYONIC UNIT TO MINE FOR LITECOIN, PROCESS VIDEO, OR ANYTHING ELSE? &gt;Our team will continue to make it possible to upgrade your FrostBit™ 1000 Cryonic Bitmining unit to allow for additional unit capabilities  So they have either made a godly chip which is very reconfigurable, allowing for using both massively different Scrypt and SHA-256 algorithms, without any physical changes, or they included ASIC implimentations of both algo's seperatly on the same asic, or lastly but most likely, they are just scamming you!   Well, this turned out much longer than expected. Ah well, hopefully I did my part in discouraging any possible purchasers from loosing their money on garbage like this, and keeping one scam less in the Bitcoin world, therefore helping keeping Bitcoins image as non scammy as possible.",™

Please share and do not change ©   Full view:  Hello! On October 25th, 2012, the next messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet of God! My name is Rouacha. I come to you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I reveal to you the following...  They want Israel to bow down and surrender to Islam. Islam is out on the massive destruction of Israel, as Israel isn't listening now.  Benjamin, you saw that Obama had an Arabic Bible in his drawer, do you remember? Under the desk... There are people replaced, who had to swear to make nothing public and to stand 100% behind Obama. Also Obama has the media under his control, completely! Someone from the White House had said to others, that Obama is the antichrist, and he told about his behavior. Shortly afterwards this man was deceased. As you know, Benjamin, Obama is playing a game and he has many personalities.  Iran is prepared for battle. Many spies have been arrested already.  The whole world does not even realize that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is more than a conqueror! Even with God's holy Scriptures they have never been able to eradicate it. So it will be with Israel! The world has abandoned Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. Few stand behind Israel, and especially many countries don't even care about Israel. Why? The world hates Israel because of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  The evil spirits hate Yeshua, Jesus, and have already started the war, and want the world to bow down to Obama and Islam! Who can overcome Islam? Who is the god of revenge and which God is the God of peace, love and kindness? Who gave Israel many miracles? The time is very near! Choose this day whom you want to serve.  God protects the airspace and intervenes at the right time. Israel defends itself and will strike back, and the God of Israel is surely on the side of Israel! The end will come soon, repent! Yeshua HaMashiach is the only Way and the Truth and the Life: Jesus Christ.  Keep your camera's focused! Israel, your temple gate has never been destroyed. Behold, I come very soon and I will go through the gate, and I myself will clear the entrance!  Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

MAY 13, 2013 PROPHETIC REVELATION OF GOD: REPENT AND GET SAVED OR YOU WILL HAVE A VERY HARD TIME, FOR THE CANNIBALISM, FROM THE BEGINNING, WILL INCREASE IN MUCH WORSE EXTENT, WORLDWIDE! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello! On May 13th, 2013, Benjamin Cousijnsen received the following message from a messenger angel of God.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Rafaël and I am a messenger angel of God. Verily, listen attentively!  Genesis 1, verse 27 And God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.  Verily!  In Enoch chapter 6, verse 1 and 2 it says: And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.'  Listen, spoke the messenger angel of God, and he added: They did this act, in order to mock against God.  Enoch chapter 7, verse 2, 3 and 4 And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells: Who consumed all the acquisitions of men... Pay attention to what I tell you now! spoke the messenger angel of God... And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants, ""fallen angels"", turned against them and devoured mankind.  Lamentations 4, verse 10 The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;  They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.  Read for yourself: Lamentations 5, verse 10, and 2 Kings 6, verse 28 and 29 Read this for yourself.  Verily, the characteristics of cannibalism will only increase! As an example, in Waku, Texas, Michael Daniel was arrested because he had strangled a dog and was going to eat it. Also an Indian has fatally wounded his five-month-old daughter, by biting off a part of her nose and lips. The baby died. In the U.S. state of Oklahoma, Tom Ledgerwood had also made a piece of ear lost by cannibalism.  In North Korea are still people slain and eaten in secret, as also in Kenya and other countries, where the famines are increasing. Verily, the Coming of the Lord is very near!  Read for yourself: Revelation 16, verse 11 And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They didn't repent of their works.  Verily, I'm going now, but before I go: Repent, and be saved! Or you will have a very tough time! For the cannibalism, from the beginning, will increase in a much worse extent, worldwide! But he who has accepted Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, shall be saved, snatched away! from this taken-over world. The messenger angel of God spoke further, I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

There are unscrupulous people out there who will ruin your day, but you don't have to give them the chance to ruin your day.  In the case of Terraria, if you don't put your valuable resources in public worlds, it is much harder for people to deface, ruin, or steal them.      ^† Note: This was before I was made aware that the OP was playing the PS3 version which apparently only allows open games.  2. Your argument is invalid because you are assuming a premise that is in direct contradiction with the OP.  If what the OP lost ""isn't that important and is easily replaceable"", then there would be no reason for the OP to feel like ""punching a hole in a wall"" or calling it his ""worst Terraria moment"".  Obviously, the OP lost something (probably a sizeable amount of time and effort) that was valuable to him, and feels understandably upset at its loss.  3. As for your example nitpicking: you seem to not understand a very basic thing about rhetorical analogies.  There is no such thing as a perfect analogy, because if one thing were a perfect comparison to a second thing, they would pretty much be identical and there wouldn't be any point using that comparison.  There is no things that are ""exactly the same"" yet different.  The purpose of analogies is not to be a perfect comparison, but to *illustrate* a *particular* point using something that is easier to understand.  The reason I chose a car was because cars are valuable enough that anyone who owns one would probably not want to lose it, and this should be easily understandable to everyone.  Nitpicking about how a car is not at all comparable to a video game world in value and is therefore a bad example is missing the point completely.",♥

t5_2qh53,Alanrichard,1369408492,"For anyone interested in the topic, I was able to come up with the following two investigations into the use of time in Moll Flanders (and  Defoe novels in general):  a) ""Women, Work, Rearguard Politics, and Defoe’s Moll Flanders."" / By Melissa Mowry. St. John’s University, July 2008. The Eighteenth Century, vol. 49 no. 2 2008 © Texas Tech University Press, pp. 97 - 116.   http://ecti.pennpress.org/PennPress/journals/ecti/sampleArticle1.pdf  Mowry states the year 1683 was chosen by Defoe because it was a watershed year in Whig history: ""The date functions like a signature and, through the process of her narrative, Moll becomes, in effect, “1683” just as “1683” becomes the culmination of the disparate events of Moll’s life"" (p. 99) The author later states:  ""If Moll Flanders’ “1683” signature conﬁrms retrospectively that Defoe has intervened in England’s recent past, the novel’s “opening” makes it just as clear that the nature of this intervention is necessary because of inadequate state formation, for the ﬁrst page of Moll Flanders renders the very possibility of Moll’s “history” contingent upon the demise of her former confederates and then makes her past desire for such afﬁliations a consequence of a state that has failed to function as the sole “force of the community at home.” (p. 103)  b) Defoe and Fictional Time. / By Paul K. Alkon University of Georgia Press, 2010  http://books.google.ca/books?id=J5uCGg6AtG0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Why+Defoe+dates+Moll+Flanders+in+1683&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ewJA5srf3n&amp;sig=Jt2WLxr4OzBpOUuipe-zawuNqEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zgGdUfaRHsLG0gHrkICYBg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Why%20Defoe%20dates%20Moll%20Flanders%20in%201683&amp;f=false  Interesting, but peripatetic study. Reviewed by Google Books as follows: ""Alkon explores Defoe's innovative use of narrative sequences, frequency, spatial form, chronology, settings, tempo, and the reader's cumulative memories of a text. Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year is the first portrayal of a public duration—passing time shared by an entire population during a crisis—ranking Defoe among the most creative writers who have explored the way in which fictional time may influence reading time.""  I was, however, hoping to find a moire precise and ""necessary"" historical or socio-political justification for the back dating of the Moll Flanders narrative, similar to that explaining the dating of The Journal of the Plague Year to 1665 / 1666. If you have any other works or ideas which would shed light on the use of historical dating in Defoe's novels, with particular reference to his choice of back dating the narrative of Moll Flanders to the year 1683, please let me know. Thanks for your support. ",©

t5_2qh6c,epoch2012,1369409158,"My personal view of ""Hell"":  **The Refining Fire of God’s Love**  The following (seemingly terrifying) promise from Yeshua’s own lips describes the nature of God’s purification of our hearts and souls by divine fire:  &gt;Matthew 13:42: “And (they) shall cast them into a furnace of purifying, refining fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”  &gt;From the HELPS™ Word Studies: In Scripture, fire is often used figuratively – like with the “fire of God” which transforms all it touches into light and likeness with itself.  God’s Spirit, like a holy fire, enlightens and purifies so that believers can share more and more in His likeness. Indeed the fire of God brings the uninterrupted privilege of being transformed which happens by experiencing faith from Him. Our lives can become true offerings to Him as we obey this imparted faith from God by His power.  **Ebeneezer Scrooge and God’s Restorative Love**  The key to understanding the nature of God’s judgement is to know who Ebeneezer Scrooge is. That’s right: Scrooge.  In Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol“, Scrooge, a faithless, heartless and brutal man, experiences this very kind of refining fire. He is tormented. He wails. He gnashes his teeth. But this is not a retributive torment, but a restorative torment. Through his being exposed to the devastating, uncensored reality of his life, Scrooge began to realize the true toll his choices had exacted upon his fellow man.  God exposes us to all of the horrible reality of our choices in our lives: past, present and future. The devastating fire of God’s love is a light so relentless that no darkness can hope to flee from it, even within the deepest recesses of our hearts.  In the face of the sheer uncensored consequence of our actions, our souls and hearts cannot help but to relent the stubborn struggle against the truth of God’s love and God’s will for us to love and forgive each other in kind.  This is the nature of God’s judgment for us all. Out of love, we will be made whole once more.  The best news of all is the revelation that, like Scrooge’s experience, this “refining fire” can be experienced in your life today. It doesn’t need to wait for some later “Judgement Day” revelation.

t5_2qh13,Niqulaz,1369428682,"If you actually want an answer, rather than to just pose a rhetorical  question, then I guess I can bother.   What most urban riots in Europe the last 30 years have in common, would be that they all were sparked by one single, often somewhat vaguely related event, although in quite a few cases, excessive police force helps a lot if you want to get one started.*   You need a few common trends. You need a segregated immigrant population in their own little ghetto, you need a shitty economy where jobs for people with little or no education are sparse, you need a perception (no need for this to be particularly substantiated, you just need the perception) that the police force is institutionally racist, preferably monocultural, often excessively forceful during arrests of minorities, and if you have some recent policies for requiring ID or searches based on racial profiling that also helps.   All these parts culminate to create an environment where people of an immigrant background feel that they are illdisposed, unable to get a job, and largely left to their own devices in society, and with little contact outside of their local environment, you create a nice little echo-chamber where this notion gets repeated back to you, making it The Truth™.  Then you add a cataclysmic event, like mentioned above. This, in turn, leads to protests and demonstrations, and hey, it's someone speaking up against The System™, and that's cool, so people turn out for that sort of thing. But after the event is over, there's still a crowd on the streets. This crowd often contain the hardline anarchists, who are full of pent-up anger and just waiting to start The Rebellion™ against The System™. This small crowd of people, lacking any sensible outlet for their frustration, hurls a cobblestone through the window of a McDonalds (patented symbol of evil capitalism numero uno for some reason) , lights a trash dumpster on fire, gets a small adrenaline rush out of the action, and then goes on to discover that for the first time in their lives, they're actually getting attention for something they did.   This small crowd, and you don't need much more than 30-50 people, just needs to light a few garbage dumpsters alight, and throw a couple of cobblestones at the woefully outnumbered group of policemen who can do little but to watch from the sidelines, and suddenly someone speaks about them, as if they were significant.  The next night a few more daft little buggers will join the crowd, supplemented by an influx of a couple of more full-time anarchists who has showed up for the fun. They will meet with a slightly larger police force, and there will be a couple of more days of escalation, before you end up with more or less an all-out war between anarchists, ringleaders and useful idiots, versus police. In the end, things will just dwindle out. The best thing you can wish for is a serious torrential downpour of rain that lasts for a few days, because rioting in the rain just isn't any fun.   Then a few kids who participated will be tried for a handful of pieces of idiocy, nothing else will be done, and things will just go back to normal, until the next little culminating event comes around.  There's no deep logic to it, no ideology. It's just angry people who has no sensible outlet for their frustrations, throwing cobblestones at the police and lighting things on fire.It's a set of illogical acts, victimizing people who are in no way responsible for anything at all in the situation.    *Public disclaimer: Do not instigate riots. That's rude, and illegal.",™
t5_2qi58,easystormrider,1369429749,"How many English (international caliber) players have played abroad in the last decade? Hargreaves (not English born), Barton, Beckham™ and Steve McManaman.   I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple, but it isn't very common for the 75+ active players with England caps. I guess I could have added Nigel Reo-Coker, but the MLS is more of a retirement/last stop league.  Scottish and Irish players aren't really good enough to play on the continent, but Keane (the best from those two) played at Inter and Ian Harte played at Levante. I can't think of any Welsh players.   As we discussed earlier, Spurs' squad is better. Spurs have a bigger international presence and Bale is a much marketable star than Berbatov or Modric were/are (except in their home countries). Who was the last player Spurs sold to Chelsea? It was Mickey Hazard in 1985. Bigger London clubs rarely do business with each other. I can't speak definitively because I'm not Daniel Levy; I guess we'll only know for sure if United or City make a bid in 2015.  --------------  I said:  &gt; If an English team offered Ronaldo money, I don't doubt a sale would happen, but he isn't going to Manchester for 30 or 40 million.

Now you must understand this is THE NUMBER 1 FAKE CARD in the history of Pokemon cards. I own to many copy's of these fakes and unless you got them straight from the package they are most likely fake  how to tell if they are legit first edition:  Under the picture there should be a golden bar that says ""Flame Pokemon. Length yada yada yada"". on the Left of that card there will be a black circle with a 1 in the middle and the words on top ""edition"".   there will also be at the very bottom these words ""© 1995,96,98,99 Nintendo, Creatures, GAMEFREAK. © 1999 Wizards.""  here is how you can tell if they are fake:  look at the border that surrounds the picture.

Please share and do not change ©   Full view:  Hello! On October 25th, 2012, the next messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet of God! My name is Rouacha. I come to you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I reveal to you the following...  They want Israel to bow down and surrender to Islam. Islam is out on the massive destruction of Israel, as Israel isn't listening now.  Benjamin, you saw that Obama had an Arabic Bible in his drawer, do you remember? Under the desk... There are people replaced, who had to swear to make nothing public and to stand 100% behind Obama. Also Obama has the media under his control, completely! Someone from the White House had said to others, that Obama is the antichrist, and he told about his behavior. Shortly afterwards this man was deceased. As you know, Benjamin, Obama is playing a game and he has many personalities.  Iran is prepared for battle. Many spies have been arrested already.  The whole world does not even realize that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is more than a conqueror! Even with God's holy Scriptures they have never been able to eradicate it. So it will be with Israel! The world has abandoned Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. Few stand behind Israel, and especially many countries don't even care about Israel. Why? The world hates Israel because of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  The evil spirits hate Yeshua, Jesus, and have already started the war, and want the world to bow down to Obama and Islam! Who can overcome Islam? Who is the god of revenge and which God is the God of peace, love and kindness? Who gave Israel many miracles? The time is very near! Choose this day whom you want to serve.  God protects the airspace and intervenes at the right time. Israel defends itself and will strike back, and the God of Israel is surely on the side of Israel! The end will come soon, repent! Yeshua HaMashiach is the only Way and the Truth and the Life: Jesus Christ.  Keep your camera's focused! Israel, your temple gate has never been destroyed. Behold, I come very soon and I will go through the gate, and I myself will clear the entrance!  Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

But I knew the risks when I went in and letdown after letdown just left me happy to get anything.  I'm now confident they can produce the rest of my order within two weeks™.  Ok, maybe a month.  The BTC cost from lost mining was offset because I ended up selling the old rigs for BTC.  Even last year I was mining at a USD loss and I couldn't predict the rise in value, so selling ~4 Gh/s of rigs for BTC was an easy choice.  My only play was to invest in ASICS, and I had 3 choices.  In hindsight I should have hedged by placing orders with all 3 ASIC companies at the time (BASIC, AVALON, BFL).  As it turns out I bet on BFL based on their overhyped promises and I still don't know if it'll ever pay off the original BTC wager.   Despite all their delays, I don't think I deserve anything from BFL besides my original order.  I don't think they were trying to mislead buyers, they were just incompetent and I should have seen it based on their history with FPGAs.   I'll update after 24 hours of mining.

Every time someone almost eliminates him, McMahon will show up on the Titantron and tell them no... Don't do it. Not yet.  It comes down to the final 4 wrestlers in the ring.

Sami gets reckless and goes for his finisher the BBE (Best Brainbustah Ever) But Bo throws him off the rope to crash and burn on the guardrail. McMahon is on the screen, pale, tracheotomy tube breathing for him, starts to get a look of concern. That wasn't the finish....  Dallas jumps down smiling ear to ear, knowing that he is shooting on the Royalty of Sports Entertainment and they don't know yet.   Cesaro locks up Dallas for the Halls Eucalyptus Cough Drop™ (Last week it was the Luden's Cherry Drop™) powerbomb into Ohno's Roaring Elbow. Dallas swings for a headscissor takedown and Ohno legit knocks Cesaro with the elbow.  Ohno freaks, and is looking dumbfounded. McMahon's heart monitor beeping loudly. It was said that whoever wins this match was going to be the one to defeat the Undertaker. That's all Wrestling Observer has been saying. Legitimately 300 tweets a day saying just that. Dallas rushes up shoves Ohno over the top to the floor.  The Arena is starting to shake from the Boos that they just don't want to see that smile... and yet again he flashes his grin. The mat is turning crimson from Cesaros blood. Dallas, weakly, picks up Cesaro, and does his finisher. A bodyslam. A standard, run of the mill scoop slam. Cesaro unable to function, just lies there. Dallas picks up Cesaro, and tosses him over the rope. He smiles wide, yet again, smacks his hands together for a job well done and points at the Wrestlemania sign. McMahon literally has a massive heart attack on air and dies, the last thing he sees is Dallas's oily, creepy, smile.

t5_2uc6j,darkflare42,1369484923,"**Q&amp;A Continued:**  * **Q: I have noticed there are various ""bombing points"" in some missions in HB. Would you consider adding those bombing points on the airfields in arcade(hangars for example)? This way bombers can get a good chunk of the airfield without having to destroy the whole thing. Modular damage and modular rewards instead of getting minuscule rewards for hits. Obviously, you'd still need a good amount of bomb Kg to take them down**  * **A:**  Yes we will add more targets similar to what you stated  * **Q: If and when will some bullets drop-down trajectory change? some bullets are like lasers**  * **A:**  The bullet drop should be historically accurate, there is dispersion over distance. We have something planned in the future - to add more realistic trajectory bullets like sliding a bit so they will deflect from the trajectory. The recoil will kick your plane a bit and it will change the bullets trajectory as a result. In 1.30 you will get better recoil, it will be way more close to the real recoil. It will change the way everyone shoots and aims in WT  * **Q: Protection of airfields, currently there is some AAA and it isn't that efficient, anyone can take them out pretty easily by flying low, do you plan to add more protection to airfield like for instance re-spawning AAA?**  * **A:** There will be changes in the maps, I will take this issue to the map guys. We did have an issue where AAA were not able to shoot down low-flying targets, but as far as we know is has been fixed. We will look into putting some more AAA or making some other changes, like re-spawning low-caliber flak.  * **Q: Weather - many aircraft lack poor weather instrumentation (like no artificial horizon), when you play a battle in HB and FRB there are many instances when you take off in a rainstorm or a combination of night &amp; rainstorm. It is ridiculous and it is so un-historical and impossible to play under these conditions. Is there any chance to get a change in the weather patterns?**  * **A:** We discussed this a few days ago and we came up with a solution that will have some specific weather types (like ""very rare"", ""common"" etc.) so these combinations like night &amp; rainstorm will be almost impossible to encounter. There will also be better patterns per map - for desert you will not encounter too many rainstorms, and in forest you will encounter more rain. But yeah, We are working on the way the weather appears and works in matches.  * **Q: People with Nvidia GFX (I have GTX 680) are experiencing mini-crashes currently, is this issue known? will it be fixed?**  * **A:** Send us some logs of when you experience this, and also post it on the forums. We are working hard to fix all these crashes (all the mini patches with crash fixes are to try and fix these), so please send us these micro-freeze logs so we can check it, Thank you.  * **Q: Solution to ramming: ramming is prevalent, so a solution could be that when you ram, you lose your most expensive plane (and need to pay the repair price for it)**  * **A:**  Its kind of hard to figure out who is ramming on purpose. It is difficult to find who had the intention and who was innocently rammed, maybe you both rammed into each other accidentally, what about head-ons? In short its not that easy as you might think, and so any solution like this will not work 100% of the time.  * **Q: With tank battles coming soon™, do you intend to create real 3D craters (from artillery shells, bombs and so on)? Craters where small tanks could slip in and use as cover?**  * **A:** We have craters currently in-game but they do not affect ground vehicles. This is planned and in development but it is not highest priority right now. Until any ground forces announcement will pop up - it currently is not important.  * **Q: Altitude - will there be some improvement to plane performance at different altitude or weather? like humidity in clouds or high pressure at high altitude?**  * **A:**  We will look into this  * **Q: Regarding the announcement about PS4, how will it work on the system? Are we going to be on different servers?**  * **A:** Similar gameplay, similar options for PC and PS. We are now eager to make the game 100% cross-platform.   * **Q: Will the Do-335 be added to the game?**  * **A:** If it is in the Release tree then yes it will be eventually added to the game. Regarding the Do-335 I can say that yes it will be in the game  * **Q: Will there be an indicator in the GUI that will show you the number of days you have been connected and the how many days you will have until next reward?**  * **A:** Put it in the suggestion sub-forum and we will see what we can do  * **Q: Will there be any Golden Eagle reward-events in the clan system?**  * **A:** Yes we might have events like this once the clan system is up and running  * **Q: In HB will there be a possibility to let the match carry on even if all planes have been destroyed? As in the ground targets just basically keep on fighting until one side wins?**  * **A:** Probably not, it will take too long, and it is very dependent on what ground targets are still up  * **Q: When will we get better MM?**  * **A:** You already know the answer: Soon™  * **Q: Will we be able to have more realistic bomb views can and will you be able set altitude, speed etc while using it?**  * **A:** It will be in the future but no ETA, still tons of stuff to do.   * **Q: HB can be unfair for both allies and Germans. Allies get MM with lots of Doras and 109's and Germans get MM with jets a lot. Can Gaijin be able to limit plane selection based on year of production?**  * **A:** The picture will change in 1.30 because a lot of allied plane's FM will change to reflect the correct capabilities of the planes. So you will fly the correct FM for P-38, P-47 and P-51 to name a few.  * **Q: Regarding rocket planes, 6 mins is not enough, not even for arcade, are there plans to change it?**  * **A:** It will be changed sometime in an upcoming update (no indication that it will be in 1.30), it will be more fun to fly them in ARCADE (No word on HB\FRB)  * **Q: Will you update the mouse-hover info of the planes in the tech-tree?**  * **A:**  It is difficult for us to take every bit of data which is incorporated in the game and put it into a visual representation like an encyclopedia. We will do it eventually but it will take time  * **Q: Will it be possible to carry on chatting with the players once the battle is over?**  * **A:** Maybe, put it in the suggestion-sub forum and we will look into it  * **Q: Playing in squadrons should be encouraged, will you plan to give awards for people who play in squads?**  * **A:**  When you are in a squadron you are more effective so you will get a better k/d ratio, more ground targets etc. You basically get more benefits by playing in one, so probably no, we will not add awards for playing with squads.  * **Q: Will you implement German guided anti-ship missiles?**  * **A:** Probably yes, not sure if radio-guided but we do plan to add more ammo types.  * **Q: Will we be able to fold the wings in naval fighters?**  * **A:** Some planes can already do this, but you just have no control over it. Either way it is not high priority. There is a lot of cool stuff already coded in certain models but it is not being used in-game atm - like opening your canopy.  * **Q: Regarding the Arado-234, it feels as if it is too weak for its tier, are there planes to change it's rank?**  * **A:** Not in the upcoming update, we currently think that it is where it should be  * **Q: Can we get the Balkenkreuz instead of the X (which replaces the swastika) on German planes?**  * **A:** Balkenkreuz maybe, we are planning to remove the X sign from the tail ",™

Infamous for his bravado and outrageously daring prison escapes, Mesrine carried out numerous robberies, kidnappings and murders in a criminal career that spanned continents until he was shot dead in 1979 by France's notorious anti-gang unit. Thirty years after his death, his infamy lives on. Mesrine was helped along the way by beautiful and equally reckless Jeanne Schneider (CÃ©cile de France), a Bonnie to match his Clyde.

t5_2qm4e,fsaui585o12m3,1369502834,"This may be a stretch, but you reminded me of this claim that intelligence is correlated with liking music that doesn't contain human voice.  http://www.psmag.com/culture-society/classical-music-linked-to-high-intelligence-27959/  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.730/abstract   &gt; The origin of values and preferences is an unresolved theoretical problem in social and behavioral sciences. The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis, derived from the Savanna Principle and a theory of the evolution of general intelligence, suggests that more intelligent individuals are more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values and preferences than less intelligent individuals but that general intelligence has no effect on the acquisition and espousal of evolutionarily familiar values and preferences. Recent work on the evolution of music suggests that music in its evolutionary origin was always vocal and that purely instrumental music is evolutionarily novel. The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis would then imply that more intelligent individuals are more likely to prefer purely instrumental music than less intelligent individuals, but general intelligence has no effect on the preference for vocal music. The analyses of American (General Social Surveys) and British (British Cohort Study) data are consistent with this hypothesis. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of intelligence on musical preference is not a function of the cognitive complexity of music. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",©

t5_2qh1i,DownTheVote,1369503268,"I dont recall a source, but many years ago I read a couple articles on the matter. My fav of the two claimed the best and most compelling 'sightings' coincided to the day and hour with (declassified)classified test flights of the Hav Blue and Tacit Blue programs( I truly adore the image of the Nighthawk sitting inthe darkened hanger with just the nose poking out. Thing looks JUST LIKE a %#$*@×© saucer). The other suggested that Dreamland, since the mid80's has housed and flown completely ficticious projects. And that the actual programs were moved to either a Utah NBC test reservation(who in Hell wants to poke around there?) Or a 'abandoned' missile complex in Colorado. The Colorado rationale being that 'next gen' vehicles would be exoatmospheric and possibly true VTOL.  I am skeptical that F22 and F35 are anything 'special'. I really do doubt that DOD would let anyone see it, let alone export it, if it were all that hitech or effective.

On or after July 17th, 2013, Google will take the last step in the shutdown and will save a copy of your Buzz posts to your Google Drive, a service for storing files online. Google will store two (2) types of files to your Google Drive, and the newly-created files will not count against your storage limits.   &gt;The first type of file will be private, only accessible to you, containing a snapshot of the Google Buzz public and private posts you authored. The second type of file will contain a copy of only your Google Buzz public posts. By default it will be viewable by anyone with the link, and may appear in search results and on your Google Profile (if you’ve linked to your Buzz posts). Note, any existing links to your Google Buzz content will redirect users to this file. Any comments you made on other users’ posts will only be saved to those users’ files and not to yours. Once the change described in this email is final, only that user will be able to change the sharing settings of those files. This means that if you have commented on another author’s private post, that author could choose to make that post and its comments public. If you would like to avoid that possibility, delete all your Buzz content now.  &gt;The new Google Drive files will only contain comments from users that previously enabled Google Buzz, and the files will not contain comments that were deleted prior to moving the data to your Google Drive.  &gt;Once the files are created, they will be treated the same as any other Drive file. They are yours to do with as you please. This includes downloading them, updating who can access them, or deleting them.   &gt;Before these files are created, you can view the Google Buzz posts you have authored here. If you do not want any of your Buzz posts or comments saved to Google Drive files, you can immediately delete your Google Buzz account and data.    &gt;Thank you for using Google Buzz.   &gt;© 2013 Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043   &gt;You have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to your Google Buzz account.",©

t5_2vd32,Nienordir,1369517865,"&gt;So then you have them try to reset their e-mail password, which asks for a security question, which they don't know the answer to.    I hate that 'additional security' so much, because you won't remember what you picked, since you'll never use it, you don't answer honestly either, because if someone has access/knowledge of your personal data, bypassing honest answers is a piece of cake.    Not to mention that you never know how those questions are implemented..do you need them to have the password mailed to you? Does it allow you to change the email address tied to the account? Can it be used on the phone to completely bypass everything?    To me it's one of those stupid security features, that don't do shit, like your password can't start with a number, needs to contain at least 2 captial letters (not connected), a space, 2 special characters and one that you'll only get by holding down alt and typing on the numpad ♥,..    Oh how much do I look forward to the day, were people can upload a custom image everywhere and then simply swipe dicks^(*-I assume it will be all the dicks-*) across the screen (or with the mouse) to login, so nobody forgets their password..what a wonderful immature future that would be..",♥

t5_2s1g4,sky2934,1369533618,"Having seen SNSD a few times during, before/after concerts, and outside of concerts, it is definitely different seeing them in person. Personally, I think it was an invigorating experience which has made me become even more of a fan than before. Despite the all the costs and energy spent attending these concerts, I thought it was all worth it, even just for the experience of going to a concert and catching a glimpse of them.   Watching their performances and looking at their pictures online is one thing but seeing them in person is something on a whole new level. They look even more amazing in person and there is a radiant aura that surrounds them. During concerts there have been many interactions between them and the fans.   ---------------  My first experience with Soshi was back during SM Town Los Angeles 2010. I was luckily enough to obtain a few pair of floor tickets with the help of Soshified and these floor tickets were literally next to the stage. There was assigned seating with foldable chairs but the security was fine with the audience standing up or next to the railings. My friends and had a really good position next to the center stage and our hands could basically extend onto the stage if we wanted to. It was my very first concert with SNSD and when they came out I was in shock and awe. The energy and the atmosphere was amazing and the concert felt like it went by too fast. During the closing ceremony as the groups were coming across the center stage, we had the opportunity to shake their hands as they passed by and they smiled back as they did so. It was my first interaction with them and it certainly was not my last.   ------------------  One of my most favorite moments was during SM Town New York in 2011. I was again at the floor area but this time there was no seating and it was general admission so whoever got there first had the choice of choosing where they stood. I had bought a Rilakkuma doll at a local store the day prior to the concert as I had distinctly remembered that YoonA's favorite doll was the Rilakkuma from all the recent fancams/fan accounts and I brought him with me into the concert in hopes of giving it to her (I.E.: http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee511/ricerboix/YoonA/rilakummafans1.gif | http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee511/ricerboix/YoonA/rilakummafans2.gif). It was during Kissing You when YoonA noticed me and my Rilakkuma. During the performance she was walking by the part of the stage where I was standing and I happened to be next to the rails again. I knew that this was the opportunity for her to see me and Rilakkuma and so I waved it in the air hoping to catch her attention. She noticed immediately and her expression changed from a focused to a awe and playful state. From that I saw her acknowledgement of me and my Rilakkuma and she responded with a smile. As the performance went on I had about a least good minute of fan interaction with her as she blew me kisses and she made a big  ♥ at me before returning back to the center stage. I was not able to give the Rilakkuma to her as I had originally intended but that fan interaction was unforgettable.   -----------   Another concert moment was during SM Town Anaheim 2012 when I had brought up a fansign made by a friend that said [""BANANAAA POTATONAAA""](http://i.imgur.com/tr82uXl.jpg). This fansign was a refernce to the ""Banana Potato"" song from the minions in Despicable Me. TaeTiSeo was seen talking about the song and even performed their own rendition of the song during the radio show a couple of weeks or so before the coming to Anaheim (Video of their rendition of the song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fYIEwNSrNtY). When they performed Kissing You, Tiffany saw the sign, stopped and smiled, gave the thumbs up and bowed (http://youtu.be/HRE_3oNb3yw?t=16s).   - ._. I just noticed that my most memorable concert moments are during Kissng You performances.   ----------------------  If you do get a chance to see SNSD perform in person, don't miss any moment of it. For me and most fans, it is a refereshing experience seeing them every time!",♥

I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am a messenger angel of God, Zebulon.  Benjamin Cousijnsen, north of Las Vegas is a secret military base of the U.S. Air Force, located in the Nevada desert: Area 51. I reveal to you the following: Obama said yet smiling, ""If there is life on other planets, then let me know.""  Job 1, verse 6 and 7 Now it happened on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, that satan also came among them.  2 Corinthians 11, verse 14 and 15 And no wonder, for even ""Obama,"" added the messenger angel of God, satan, masquerades as an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ministers, ""the U.S. military Air Force,"" added the messenger angel of God, also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works. Thus speaks the almighty God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham!  They do not want people to know, that extraterrestrial beings exist, and are housed in the Research Centre. One has already done many tests with this 'visitors from space'!    Mark 4, verse 14 and 15 The farmer sows the word. These are the ones by the road, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately ""Obama,"" added the messenger angel of God, satan, comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.  Also I reveal to you, that they have UFO landing strips and towers and buildings. They have even made contact with different life. Verily, Obama spoke:  Mark 3, verse 23 He summoned them, and said to them in parables, ""How can satan cast out satan?  Mark 3, verse 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  Area 51 also possesses a UFO of the beings from space. In secret they have built many spaceships. The speed is slightly slower than that of a meteorite. The shape is triangular. Also they have copied the weapons of these beings!    Luke 4, verse 6 and 7 The devil said to him, ""I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want. If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.""  Verily, verily, I tell you, unexpectedly Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ will come!  John 8, verse 12, and John 3, verse 35, and Luke 21, verse 10 to 12, and John 3, verse 16 Read this aloud. Here it is written: John 8, verse 12 Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, ""I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life"". John 3, verse 35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. Luke 21, verse 10 to 12 Then he said to them, ""Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake"".  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  The messenger angel of God spoke, I'm going now prophet Benjamin, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!  SHALOM! God bless   Note: Full text display for the deaf, hearing impaired and speakers of other languages...

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On January 14th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, I am Arodai, the messenger angel of God. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Benjamin, the fallen angels are superior extraterrestrial higher developed devilish technological angels. Their appearance is as an observable beautiful angel of light. These false angels master the linguistics, and are highly gifted in flawless English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese and many other languages. They have remarkable UFOs transport equipment. Also, they try to stand close to the Almighty with their knowledge.    Also, there have been taken place many today's encounters with the antichrist Obama. The involvement with Earth is enormously! Obama is also telepathically connected with these fallen angels of satan.  Benjamin, between Mars and Jupiter is one planet, where many fallen angels are.  And also in Mexico, in the sea, a transport base for UFOs is located. The government remains as quiet as the grave about the fallen angels! The antichrist and the pope and the Muslim Brotherhood have already been in touch and made plans and signed them. They want the fallen angels to reveal and show themselves! This is done already.  Ephesians 6, verse 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.  Many Christians often forget to ask for protection. Read these scriptures aloud: Romans 13, verse 12 The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.  Isaiah 54, verse 17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says the LORD.  Ephesians 6, verse 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, verily,  2 Samuel 22, verse 31 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.   Benjamin, some Christians want God to do everything for them, without doing anything themselves. They are still just babies, who have it all their own way. Wake up there! God is very holy! God just wants you to fight against it. Use God's armor, cover yourself, Christian warriors, under the Blood of Jesus Christ, and defeat this chameleon. Come, stand on it, crush its head in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Thus there are many, who put aside the Holy Spirit, and just keep complaining, why God did not help them!  Job 5, verse 8 and 9 But as for me, I would seek God, To God would I commit my cause; Who does great things that can't be fathomed, Marvelous things without number.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, stand in His strength, and thank Him, who belongs all honor and worship! Amen.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! said the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM!

t5_2qh0n,samloveshummus,1369558362,"This is more something I see in practice rather than an ""official"" mathematics notation, but I hate the notation df/dx to mean the derivative of f: f' = f^\(1\). What exactly is 'x'? Obviously the derivative is independent of the name of the variable, therefore it is absurd to refer to x in denoting the derivative of the function.   Sure it's not likely to cause trouble in lots of situations, but I've seen cases where people use some tricky applications of the chain rule and totally screw themselves over by using this notation and getting confused between actual variables and arbitrary names for derivatives.  The notation d/dx f(x) is useful (and necessary for calculations) when the x is exhibited as the parameter of the function; it's only when we have a decapitated d/dx which refers to nothing that I have a problem.   So I would say d/dx sin(x) = cos(x) ↔ sin' = sin^\(1\) = cos, but **not** d/dx sin = cos.

t5_2xbci,Lenticular,1369561435,"For one the the release of the Game cube meant a change from catridge based games to disc based games. So there should be really no question as to why BC didn't launch out of the gate with the Gamecube.  Two the bottom of the Gamecube had an ext slot that allowed for BC via the [gameboy player](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Player-Accessory-Nintendo-GameCube/dp/B000090W86). &gt;Game Boy Player lets you play more than **1,200 Game Boy, Game Boy Color &amp; Game Boy Advance** games on your TV through GameCube. GBP is a 1 inch platform that connects to bottom of GameCube.  Three that trend has been continued  &gt;Backward compatibility on Wii  &gt;&gt;The original model of Nintendo's successor console, the Wii, supports backward compatibility with Nintendo GameCube controllers, memory cards, and games. Due to the differing footprints of the device, the Game Boy Player is not compatible with the Wii. The South Korean Wii, the ""Wii Family Edition""[26] and the Wii Mini all omitted GameCube hardware completely; GameCube games and accessories are not compatible with these systems as a result. The Wii's successor, the Wii U, also lacks GameCube backward compatibility, but is in turn compatible with Wii controllers and games.  Btw the Wii U is backwards compatible with the Wii [1], the Wii with the Gamecube[2][3] the 3DS with the DS.  1[The system is backward compatible with Wii, and Wii U games may support compatibility with Wii peripherals, such as the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U)  2[It succeeds the Nintendo GameCube, with early models being fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)  3[In late 2011 Nintendo released a reconfigured model, the ""Wii Family Edition"", which removed Nintendo GameCube compatibility; this model was *not released in Japan*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)  This means I can adopt a wait and see attitude for the newer consoles.  The lineup for the 3DS is *AMAZING* and has rejuvenated the gamer in me and diminished my jaded perspective somewhat.  I have the pick of the crop of cheaper and astoundingly good DS titles with the bonus of having a worldwide library of games to choose from since the DS is region free. Most of these games are at a discount as well.  ☑ Strategy games  ☑ Simulations  ☑ Import gaming  ☑ Low prices  ☑ Ability to explore IP's such as Fire Emblem on the Wii, 3DS and Virtual Console.  ☑ Explore new experiences such as Visual Novels like 999 etc.  ☑ Experience the joy of collecting older and rare games on the cheap such as Infinite Space and just about everything that Atlus brings over.  ☑ Play hidden Gems such as Fortune Street (I'm a huge Culdcept fan) on the Wii U. Having skipped a Wii for myself FS cost $13 and there is still all that other Wii gaming goodness that is cheap to own.  ☑ Plus I get to play the new hotness like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart 7, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem etc, in bed with my boyfriend.  ☑ Motherfucking Swapnote!  So now I get to play new experiences, a great many of the coop, at a price that doesn't break the bank! I got Resident Evil for the 3DS for $10 bucks each (coop),  Art Academy for $15 (learn to draw), Two new 3DS XL's @ $161 each, access amazing apps like [Colors!3D](http://colorslive.com/downloads_3ds.php) (community driven 3D drawing app @ $6.99), Rytmik (Pocket Music Creation station), [Petit Computer](http://www.petitcomputer.com/) (Basic Programming emulator that uses QR codes to read files) and lots of other really cool content that I won't bore you with.  Plus I've got 3d video, pictures and gaming!  Since the 3DS is BC I have access to the previously mentioned Rytmik, Petite Computer, as well as stuff like Game Gear games and motherfucking Bomberman!  It's hard to say, with all of this access to badass gamery provided through BC, that Nintendo is not all about the games.  The have tomorrow's games, today's games, and yesterday's games.  All easily accessible, with fun factors that are off the chart.  They are not worried about your used game sales.  They are not preoccupied with having to be always on.  And they have the engineers that are capable enough to provide BC (for the most part) without having to make excuses because they are all about the fucking games.  The more YOU as a gamer are more about the fucking games then the more BC will make sense to you as a gamer.  I'm expecting that the Wii U will announce that it can support multiple gamepads.  Because that is a killer fucking app that makes games actually more fun to play without privacy concerns or having to subsidize a hella expensive camera that few actually want.  What's odd is that although you true gamers don't want the kinect, you sure don't gripe about having to pay extra for it.  But omg having to pay the price of one game or less for ardware BC is just going waaaay to far.   What's funny is that you can actually expect BC because it is an offering that distinguishes sony and ms respectively from their competitor.  At this moment they are holding their cards close to their chest.  To drive interest in new software sales they will downplay the role of BC for a time, then introduce it after *finding* a way to monetize it.  So while you guys are subsidizing the kinect, paying $500-600 or more after getting all of peripherals and extra controllers plus your two launch titles, me and my hunny bunny  are going to catch up on good old fashion grinning ear to ear gaming, at a discount no less, and let you first responders get ass pounded by the people that you know are going to asspound you (c'mon you have to know this!  Look at the pricing schedules, the nickle and diming, DLC this and that, DRM fees yadda yadda!)  Am I going to get an X1?  Hells yah! A PS4? Undoubtedly! I'm just going to wait until it is sensible to do so.  Why?  Because now I have access to all the games I wanted to play but couldn't justify buying previously, but now I can since everything is hella cheap AND I still get to play the new NINTY FRESH shit.  Oh yeah. I'm probably going to pick Fortune Street tomorrow.  It's supposed to be pretty hard to get first place, which is just the way I like my games.",☑

Once you do that, your browser goes fullscreen mode, and opens up new reddit gold page that takes you out of context of what were you doing, where you have wide selection of options, like the reply button you wanted.  Once you click reply button there, reddit gold window closes, browser goes out of fullscreen mode, and takes you right back to the beginning, only now you have a reply box where you can type under the comment you wanted to prove wrong.  It's a different sort of task, used as example, but the design/logic/functionality behind it exactly the same as Windows 8 start button.  It indeed functions as intended, but what's the fucking point, beside annoying user with constant context switching?",™
t5_2sc3f,pwncloud,1369563804,"This isn't exactly equivalent.  If it were, then ""Reddit 7.0"" would already not have small buttons below comment.  To access what you want, in this case the reply button, you would still have to press the Reddit™ button on your keyboard or click the Reddit™ button at the bottom left of a comment box.  After, instead of your browser going into fullscreen mode, you would get a reddit gold popup, where you have a wide selection of options, like the reply button you wanted.  Once you click reply button there, reddit gold popup closes, and takes you right back to the beginning, only now you have a reply box where you can type under the comment you wanted to prove wrong.  My point?  The fullscreen start menu didn't make anything any more or less inconvenient.  What you do and need from the start menu is the same, and the steps you have to take to open and close it are the same.",™

t5_2qh3l,Anynomus,1369586059,"The idea that patents generally, and Myriad’s patents in particular, hinder research is a common misconception. A moment’s careful reflection shows, however, that this is counter-intuitive. Advancing BRCA and breast cancer research is strongly in Myriad’s interest, both as an organization dedicated to the progress of science and patient care and even as a for-profit company. Pushing research in this area forward benefits patients and Myriad alike.  Beyond intuition, the indisputable facts show that Myriad and its patents have far from hindered research and instead have actively promoted it. Since the discoveries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 more than 18,000 scientists have researched the BRCA genes, publishing more than 8,600 research papers. Myriad also has a policy to collaborate with researchers on studies relating to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. In fact, since the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were discovered, Myriad has collaborated with over 440 outside researchers and participated in more than 110 research programs/studies by outside researchers. Over the last 20 years Myriad has spent millions of dollars doings its own research and supporting that of others. In one specific example that directly relates to many peoples' concerns about researching cancer treatment, Myriad has collaborated with (and continues to collaborate with) several pharmaceutical companies on the development of their PARP inhibitor drugs for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. Indeed, early indications are that Myriad and its gold-standard BRACAnalysis® testing will play a critical role in ultimately delivering these drugs to patients. In this case, truly the reality is quite different from the rhetoric.",®

t5_2qjvn,VanillaSubstitute,1369608127,"Karaokeeee~!!!! :) Oh god, I couldn't stress that out further. Even if we aren't gifted with a golden voice, we all have that frustrated singer within us that just goes all out when it's karaoke time. It would be a great bonding moment, the sillier and more difficult the songs, the better. Don't worry about singing them perfectly, just start off silly to ease tension! Hopefully there would be Filipino selections among the songs that she could sing.  Here in the Philippines, there's everyday hustle and bustle from relatives, neighbors, kids, etc. so I would take her to a lively and homey environment to start (our culture is primarily focused on the family and home). I agree that taking her to a Filipino hangout spot would be a great way to relieve her homesickness (or if there's nothing near your area, even online forums would do). Let her learn from other Filipinos how to adapt to the new environment (if you plan on going with her and feel like doing cultural exchanges, better!) then gradually introduce her to other races/nationalities so that she wouldn't get fixated on just being with Filipino folks. Maybe introduce her to your own group of friends if you feel like it. :) We also do our own chores manually, even the laundry is handwashed (for most anyway)! So try doing even just little chores with her, share tips, kid around, stuff like that... especially cooking. On a regular household, we cook our own food almost all of the time and eating out is normally of a treat. So homemade cooking is a big part of our culture... maybe having small barbecue parties with friends would be nice! Filipino/Asian groceries would be awesome, but I would think a Farmer's market would be very reminiscent of local markets over here, so that might be a nice place to go to as well when she feels like buying stuff to cook.   But as with anything, try getting to know her first as there really is no one-size fits all... she's her own individual and try to get to know her by sharing interests, learning from each other, talking about her hometown, her dialect... about how was it like living in the Philippines, etc... but in gradual increments so she wouldn't just suddenly break down crying, wanting to go home. Try doing it in an environment familiar to her, so it would feel less of a pressure. I'm touched by your kind gesture and I'm sure she is, and she'll easily take a liking to you as you can now see. But for both of your sakes, try not to make it too one-sided, as she's the one in a new environment learning to adapt, and not you. Else, she'll get too focused on the cultural differences. If you feel like learning a new culture, that would be immensely better, and you might be in for a surprise yourself! Adapting requires compromise from both parties, so might as well let it be fun. :) Good luck and Mabuhay from the Philippines~ ♥",♥

Whether or not this pricetag accurately reflects actual production and R+D costs of the drug is unknown.

Brazil and the U.S didn't have food scarcity issues related to not being able to grow enough food, all hunger was socially created. Are you saying ""starving"" countries are importing GMOs?   http://www.organicvalley.coop/why-organic/research-library/gmos/the-false-promise-of-gmos/page-1/  &gt;The two main GMO crops being grown today—BT corn (repels corn borers) and Roundup™ Ready soybeans (withstands herbicide treatments)—are actually animal feed crops, not food crops. Impoverished nations consume little meat protein and will see little benefit from the adoption of these GMO crops. The third most commonly planted GMO crop is BT cotton—not a crop intended to feed the starving. ",™

t5_2rp0r,computertech,1369653555,"Here is my race report - the race today was all around the Pennypack Park (in Philadelphia)- but it was mostly on trails. I had no idea how beautiful the trails were - it is unbelievable. It is by far the most beautiful place to run around here. I recommend it and I won't be running anywhere else (when I can run again). There all trails everywhere, on both sides of the river just off the main path.   So, on Friday night I had a dream I was running very hard and during that dream a cramp actually developed on my right calf again (the one that a 28 mile run unbearable a couple of weeks ago). I could barely move and I shook my wife, waking her up and begging her to do something. The cramp went away but the pain stayed. I tried a lot of massage on Friday and Saturday and I was very worried about how it was going to affect my race today.  This morning, we got up at 6 am, it was awfully cold and windy and it was hard to get out of bed but my wife helped me get ready. I drank a protein shake, ate some eggs and then sipped on caffeinated coffee (I've been off caffeine for a long time), which helped me wake up. She drove me to the race starting line. As usual, all the crazy runners showed up, including an actual barefoot guy that I met on my delaware lehigh marathon named Everett. Most runners doing the 50 miler part of the race were super tall and looked like those skinny olympic dudes. Right then I thought: ""yeah, sounds like I am going to finish last on this one too"".   My plan was to take it easy for 5 miles, go all out for 10 miles and treat every loop (15.5 miles) as its own race (this is very important, it made things a lot easier).   The first loop was actually 18.5 miles, we went around for 3 miles to make sure we did 50 miles and not just 46.5. I stuck to my plan and I noticed that while people were thinking and talking about the two other loops of the race I was just focusing on finish the first loop as fast I could. I finished ahead of a lot of the olympic looking guys and that gave me a boost of confidence. I made it back to the starting line and aid station - had some food (potatos dipped in salt, salt pills, oranges and some other food) changed my drenched shirt and got back on loop.   2nd loop mile 18.5: That was when things started to get hard. I walked a little bit but felt it was getting harder to keep walking so I started jogging - I then hit one the shittiest walls I ever did (between mile 23 and 27), I was getting out of it and not feeling right. I finally met up with the Everett guy again, I also tripped at least 3 times on that loop (my poor toes..). Everett kept the pace going and I started to struggle, but I told my self ""just finish the second loop.. my wife will be there and she will take care of things for me"". At the last aid stop of the second loop I decided to bypass filling up water and getting nutrition and make a dash for the end of the loop. It was also a great time to leave the olympic and army dudes behind. It was mile 31 and for some reason I thought I only had to go for 2 more miles but it ended up being 3 miles (and that makes a huge difference when you are sprinting.) I pushed through and when I got the finish line.. my wife was there.   3rd loop, mile 34: I chugged some food, water and whatever I could find in front of me and I decided that I was going to at least make it to mile 40, I felt I could do that. My wife took on the hydration backpack and we set off. We ran the first couple of miles pretty well but after mile 37 I was really feeling the pain. I wanted to walk, stop, sit down and be done with that shit My wife told me: ""look, don't listen to your brain, I am your brain. Turn off your brain and just listen to me, you can do this, I know your legs hurt and you are exhausted but you gotta press on"". At the point we could no longer walk the toughest gravely and extremly rocky hills (some of them were very very steep) we just have to keep running otherwise I was going to stop. We also figured out a plan in which at the aid stations, instead of stopping I kept going and she would go ahead, get the food I needed and then meet up with me - that saved us time and made things easier for my legs.  Between mile 40 and 50 I didn't stop, walked or slowed down. I also had this weird ""life changing"" thing happened to me. My salts were ok and I didn't have a headache or anything, so I don't think I was delirious, I just felt immensenly exhausted and I had kept my brain in meditation and prayer for a long time by then. I had gone from the famous ""oh crap, I can't do this.. I don't have any more energy left"" to ""oh my goodness, I have a burst of energy and I might be able to do this"" at least 10 times.   I have read it before, that when you give all you have for so many times you reach a different level of awareness, and of what is possible. You tap into this source of something that you have no idea that you had. I remember feeling very raw and hollow - for example, thinking about my life or anyone just made my weep and I felt a complete sense of thankfulness and humility. The craziest thing, at one point I turned to my wife very seriously and said ""I feel like I am just a ball of energy"" . I remember saying that but I have no idea why I said that, maybe I was drugged and I didn't even know :). I do remember feeling like I was gliding and I had gone beyond pain, complaints, negative thoughts and anything. Anyway, I could go forever about this but the point is: I tapped into something and I overcame all the stuff I used to tell myself, that I was not a runner, fit or that I was too slow.  So, enough with the weird stuff, on the last 3 miles, she said: ""look, you did this in Leadville and you can do this again, go for it, make history again"" we took off and we were simply and plainly sprinting to the end - I met up with the barefoot guy and we finished the race side by side - the time of 9hrs and 26 minutes (I will have to check the official time and results later.   I am so sore now that I won't even talk about it, I don't think I will have any permanent damage - besides trying to reach nirvana by running again. :) Thanks for reading ☺ ",☺

t5_2qh6c,missssghost,1369669823,"I don't know what it means to have 'spiritual feelings' but it sounds the same as when I had emotional feelings for potential partners. It's hard. Stuff doesn't always work out, and it certainly doesn't work out in your own time-frame.   I felt incredibly lonely for the majority of my life, both on the aspect of friends and romance, and it can be quite a negative thing. I found myself kind of going for any man who would pay attention to me because I was really desperate and just really wanted to be with someone, and although I didn't necessarily get 'really hurt' from it, I made choices to be with people who were not the best fit for me and went through stressful breakups.   It's difficult. People often find each other at unlikely times. I met the man I am with now during my university days when we were both in seperate committed relationships and it kind of weighed on me but we were great friends for years before we were both in a place where we were single and available to each other ~ and I've been with him for some years now.   You are 21, (I am only 26 by the way (and actually just turned today!)) - you are so young !!! I can't imagine the weight added if your mother is stressing about finding you someone. I've never had my parents that involved in my love life... but honestly there is no need to feel like it's now or never. You have so much time to find the right person for you.   If this is really weighing on your mental health, please try and find some outlet (a therapist) to hash out this stuff. Keep yourself healthy first and foremost.  If you want to meet new people, volunteer in new programs or join a group or sports team or something community based. Get out there ~ you are single, charming, intelligent and beautiful most likely and have a lot to offer the world ! Try and stay positive and get out there and see what happens.  Try not to dwell on the mystery of who could be a potential husband to you before you've met someone you want to be in a relationship with. Dwelling too far into the future can make it seem impossible.   I hope something I've said is helpful. I mostly want to reiterate that I've been there. If I could go back in time to when I was pretty much crying every single night alone in my room, I would tell myself to please calm down. I'm not sure I would have listened though ~ I know it's difficult.   Just keep your chin up though!

t5_2rbli,BtotheBop,1369672678,"DeRo is a 35 year old recovering from a major knee injury, he might get back to who he was, and then again, he might not.  Goff has said from the beginning that DCU oversold Rafael badly when they called his signing a ""Major Announcement™"".  He's a project.  A talented project with great potential, but he isn't ready to contribute yet.  Ruiz is undoubtedly talented.  On the other hand he's old, out of shape, and I hate him.  Of the other guys you've mentioned, I like Korb and Augusto.  Korb has become a much better defender and he's one of the fastest guys in the league.  Augusto is the closest thing to an orchestrator we have on the team and I think he's only going to get better as he gets more time in MLS.  I wouldn't call any of these guys untouchable, but they would be hard to let go of.  Also I would add Jakovic and BMac to this group.  They aren't playing all that well right now, but neither is anyone else, and they were one of the best CB pairings in the league last year.",™

t5_2t5iz,casualblair,1369674032,"New Boss Fight:  Terrorist Cells  Strategy:    Phase 1) War  In phase one, the terror groups are very public and visible, even to casuals.  The raid must launch a full offensive to target and destroy the largest of these groups to prevent a complete wipe.  While a trivial exercise, the boss has some key abilities:  - Invoke Citizens - Low-health npcs will cluster around the targets going about their lives.  AoE must be kept to a minimum or the raid will be debuffed with ""Dissent from the Locals"" that will cause raid members to be randomly targeted with IED's.  - Take Prisoner - NPC's and Vendors will be abducted and tortured.  The raid must burst down the targets to prevent beheadings.  These can be safely ignored but for each target beheaded the raid and boss is debuffed with ""Bad Public Image"".  This stacks forever and causes both sides to suffer from backlash from their own factions, reducing reputations permenantly.  This phase ends when the raid discovers the location of the wrong leader.  Spoiler - It turns out the complete wipe mechanic was a lie.  Phase 2) Hide and Seek.  With the false leader taken out and FREEDOMZ™ distributed to the local population, the raid must split into groups to find the true boss.  He is effectively Stealthed as a level 93 boss and stealth detection mechanics are disabled.  Each small group must burst down the isolated groups of mobs as quickly as possible and move on.  This is the most boring part of the raid.  There is a lot of waiting and searching and running, and if any one member gets too isolated they can be attacked by newly spawned mobs.  This phase has 3 distinct abilities:  - Wrath of the Locals - Based on the number of stacks incurred in Phase 1, ""Dissent from the Locals"" ramps up and the smaller groups are now targeted by more IED's, as well as ranged IED's called RPG's.  In most cases these are not dodgable.    - Friendly Fire - Friendly NPC's assisting you in your search are now targetable by players.  AOE and tab targetting can send dps at the wrong targets.  While mostly harmless, there is a 15% chance that the entire faction of friendly dps will abandon you, or in a worst case, return fire increasing the number of mobs to kill.  - Public Enemy - The leader of the boss faction will taunt the raid via video.  Popping raid wide cooldowns mitigates this effect, but the majority of the time targets will return to stealth and the group must re-search for them.  This phase ends when half the raid is exhausted and big gulps are being used as bathroom breaks.  Phase 3) Boss revealed  This is a short phase that involves the complete decimation of a building and everyone in it.  The boss puts up minimal resistance, but teabagging the body BEFORE looting the building grants the team a pretty massive buff.  For the amount of work you put in in phase 2, blizzard sure copped out on phase 3.    Phase 4) Politics  For some reason, the fight doesn't end when the main target is killed.  Half the raid must continue the search for his Lieutenants and the other half must return to their capital cities and start talking to NPC's to convince them that the first half of the raid is still relevant.  This continues indefinitely.   Summary by role:  Tanks - Focus on the large mobs, rely on your dps to take down the small adds.  If you focus on the small ones you could accidentally cleave a local and increase your debuff stack.  Healers - There isn't a lot for you to do here, the mobs don't put up much of a fight.  Focus on friendly NPC's and talk the Local Citizens to encourage them to leave, run away, or help out.  Ranged DPS - Single target as much as you can.  Burst down everything quickly.  Melee DPS - At the beginning of the encounter you will be useful in clearing out buildings, but as time goes on you may want to grab the Drone Strike Backpack and pilot drones to obliterate the targets instead.  There is so much running that this proves to be much faster.",™

The only solution would be to mandate users have faster internet connections or to offer downloads.  If you, as a user, had pristine HD downloads, why would you buy a DVD of the show?

I just wanted to share her story and let you know that I sympathize.  But! There is an epilogue! Things have improved a lot over the last few years for my Mom. Her best work friend (another woman) was promoted and was her manager for the last year or so, a gay guy was brought in as an ASM (who she's constantly trying to hook me up with... x.x) who is a huge ally to her and stands up with her against the misogyny at work, and just in the last month my Mom learned she was FINALLY no longer being overlooked for promotion and would be heading toward Manager herself in the coming weeks.   The boys' club is dying a slow death. A slow, slow, slow death ... but it is dying. Chin up, and don't worry about shedding tears over the internet (especially reddit) - people say plenty of horrible, hurtful things ... getting emotional is only natural. ♥  ",♥

I mean, you CAN do that when you have a belief grounded in reality. But how can you rationalize doing that when you don't? How can you say ""this part of the bible is false"" and *not* throw the whole thing away?  Christianity sucks. As do all religions, of course. But you can't say Islam doesn't take the cake.

Audible® Free Trial Details * Get your first 30 days of the AudibleListener® Gold membership plan free, which includes one credit. In almost all cases, one credit equals one audiobook. After your 30 day trial, your membership will automatically renew each month for just $14.95, billed to the credit card you used when you registered with Audible. With your membership, you will receive one credit per month plus members-only discounts on all audio purchases. If you cancel your membership before your free trial period is up, you will not be charged. Thereafter, cancel anytime, effective the next billing cycle. See the complete terms and policy applicable to Audible memberships.  I used my trial membership on A Memory of Light, the day it came out.  Normally that Audiobook would be $50 for the 41 hours of play time, but nope, completely free.  Just make sure that if you don't want to continue with Audible you cancel the membership before the end of the 30 days.",®

TOEE Book: page 87 Room 334 Inky chamber  DM notes: Similar magic also reveals that the silver cross in the coffin lid is a magical broadsword (Fragarach, fully described in  appendix C).   Further on :  The coffin's occupant is Prince Thrommel, Grand Marshall of Furyondy, Provost of Veluna, a Paladin Lord. He lies in stasis, a powerful illusion causing him to appear as a vampire.  Other sword in the encounter:   If any character recovered the broadsword Fragarach  and was gladly willing to allow or help Thrommel to regain it, that person receives the broadsword Scather (also detailed in Appendix C) from Prince Thrommel. All rescuers are also honored by those who rule Furyondy and Veluna.  Appendix C:   FRAGARACH GP Sale Value: 90,000 XP Value: 18,000 (plus scabbard value: 35,000 gp)   This hefty steel broadsword bears a mighty enchantment. It was originally fashioned for a demigod of elsewhen, and eventually passed into the WORLD OF GREYHAWK™ Setting. It served well for a short time, all too soon falling into the hands of the minions of Chaotic Evil. It has been in their grasp for a decade or more, resting in hiding in the Temple of Elemental Evil, guarded by the worst of elemental grues. Fragarach means ""The Answerer."" The sword is of Chaotic Good alignment. Any Lawful creature trying to grasp it takes 1-6 points of damage and falls senseless for 1-10 rounds. A Neutral creature holding it takes only 1-3 points and swoons for 1-4 rounds. In evil hands, Fragarach has no ""to hit"" bonus whatsoever; in Chaotic Neutral hands, it will strike but one opponent per round. The sword functions perfectly only for a Chaotic Good user. In such hands, its + 4 bonus always operates, and it will strike as many opponents unerringly as have struck at its possessor. Fragarach always hits all such targets, the + 4 pertaining to additional damage only. Note, however, that The Answerer always strikes last in a melee round. Against evil opponents, the bonus doubles (to + 8) whenever a natural 20 is rolled for ""to hit"" determination. The sword has a hilt of silver and gold wire, most cunningly wrought. Its guard and pommel are set with perfect emeralds (corundum)—7 gems, total value 65,000 gp. Its scabbard is likewise trimmed with precious metal and decorated with many gems of green and golden hue, worth another 35,000 gp.  OTHER SWORDS OF ANSWERING  GP Sale Value: 50,000 XP Value: 10,000 (plus scabbard: 16,000 gp) When Fragarach first came to this world, it received immediate attention and quick renown; so much so, in fact, that six other swords like it were forged and enchanted. These are lesser weapons, of course, and their alignments vary. Each has a + 2 bonus (and cannot hit opponents struck only by + 3 or better weapons). On a natural ""to hit"" roll of 1, no bonus applies; on a natural 20, like their predecessor, the bonus is doubled (to + 4). These lesser swords are identified by the differing gems set in guard and pommel. They are reported to be amethyst, aquamarine, garnet, peridot, topaz, and tourmaline stones, with combined value of about 24,000 gp per weapon, 16,000 gp per scabbard. These weapons are named Rebutter, Scather, Replier, Retorter, Squelcher, and Back-Talker, in honor of Fragarach.   * Information beats any DC, its super effective. Damn Im tired.",™

That's why one relies on published research on the health effects of consumption of GMO foods.  *Just as was done for cigarettes*.  &gt;If a supplier won’t answer my questions about the source of their food, then I won’t trust them and I won’t eat it.   You sound like a Whole Foods™ customer!  Or maybe Safeway 'O'.  That's fine.   Meanwhile, I'll get my foods from ""NoFrenchMidgetsOrVanadiumMart"".    &gt; I am free along with everybody else to make purchases like voting, based on whatever reasoning we like.   Hell, yes! Sing it, brotha!  Hallelujah!    &gt;  Tobacco, alcohol sales would dwindle, and almost everyone would drive Volvos.  Volvos?  You filthy Nazi! Every would drive Priuses!  Well, everyone who wasn't biking on a fixie. Turn in your GMO-hater card right now.  I take back everything nice I've ever said.    &gt; Just as some people choose to boycott Israeli products, and some Palestinian, it is reasonable to want to boycott products from a production method, such as GMO, or a producer, such as Monsanto, GM issues notwithstanding.   Hell yes!  You boycott 'em, my good man!  But you don't necessarily get labels on every food to help you.    Because then everyone would have to get a label.  &gt; If everyone’s concerns about GM foods are unfounded as you say, then the market should prove them wrong.  And everyone would demand that GMO-free foods be labeled GMO-free, or they'd refuse to buy them.  That's what whole foods does.   And that's what my favorite store, NoFrenchMidgetsOrVanadiumMart, does as well.  That's your beloved free market in action.  You don't get to order the free market what to do.  You just bribe it, with your wallet.   ",™

t5_2r2f0,scirocco,1369757035,"Here's my take...  This is a cheap and very easy process, but it's hand-made and a good first-step.  1)  Get some copper plumbing pipe.  1/2"" is probably good for your gf, you want something that's smaller than the eventual ring.  A scrap is fine.  2)  Cut the ring out.  Use a hacksaw, and choose your width.  The ring will likely get to be a little wider when you work it.  3)  Using small files (a chainsaw-sharpening file and a flat file are ideal) smooth out the rough edges, and make it square (same width all around, in case you didn't cut straight)  4) find a sturdy piece of smooth steel smaller than your eventual ring size and clamp in a heavy vise.  Slip the ring over this and GENTLY use your (small) hammer to shape/expand the ring evenly.  It's this hand-hammering that will give it character and handmadeness™.  5) Continue to file and hammer until it looks good to you, repeat 1-4 as necessary.        Another interesting technique is to start with a larger pipe size (3/4"") and cut a wider section.  Then using your large vise (or better, a press) squish it to make it smaller in diameter/flatter.  This will create a lot of folds.  Flux and heat the copper, and add solder (plumbing, but silver solder will look better) to fill in the folds/gaps.  Now file and shape as above, with interesting patterns of copper and silver.      edit:  All of this work can be done cold, but after hammering for a while the copper will become ""work hardened"" and brittle.  Every so often, you can ""anneal"" the copper by heating it up (common propane/plumbing torch will be fine, and if you're buying one for this, do yourself a LARGE favor and get the one with trigger ignition) and then quenching it in water.  In other words, every once in a while, heat the copper up and drop in a cup of water.    ",™

t5_2r0gj,CranialEruption,1369770694,"Gonna repost most of a comment I made on Facebook about this article, focusing on a couple paragraphs.  &gt;Information that tries to embarrass the Church is generally very subjective and unfair.  Yeah, information that has the express purpose to embarrass the Church *is* usually pretty subjective and unfair. And I disagree with just making stuff up or presenting it in a bad tone \*coughGodmakerscough\*. But the problem is, it's easy to misread a statement like this. ""Information that embarrasses the Church is generally very subjective and unfair."" The outcome of presenting information is very different from the intent, but this goes unacknowledged. And even some stuff that *does* try to embarrass the church can be very subjective and fair. Take Simon Southerton's work, for example. Perhaps ""embarrass"" is too strong a word for something like that, but his intent certainly isn't to paint the Church is a positive light.  And in the next paragraph. ""Some young people are surprised and shocked by anti-Mormon material on the Internet because they haven’t fortified themselves against it."" To me, the facts aren't something that someone would *need* to ""fortify"" themselves against. I see Truth™ as something that may need fortification, but objective facts can and should be followed. There are many objective facts that I'm sure the Church finds embarrassing.  Then we talk about the need for balance. Balance is good, but ""Fair and Balanced"" is not, and that seems to be what Snow is going for. He immediately paints the Church as the wounded duck, with a ""target on [their] back."" That kind of phrasing doesn't really speak to a real ""balance"", to me. So what's his idea of balance?  &gt;If a friend came to me with an honest question about a controversial issue from Church history, I’d do my best to answer it. And if I found that he was spending a lot of time in that area, the first questions I’d want to ask him are: “Are you reading the Book of Mormon? Are you saying your prayers? Are you keeping your life in balance so that you can protect yourself against the storms of life?”  So he's balancing objective questioning with subjective feeling. Yep, seems pretty balanced to me.",™

t5_2qh3s,GroupDrink,1369772450,"I have to respectfully disagree. I believe that Transformers did have a plot. You have to look at it in terms of development.   At the beginning of the story, you have an implausibly hot girl in a scene with neither aliens, nor explosions. As the plot progresses, the implausibly hot girl is now in a scene with aliens, but still there are no explosions. Then, in a stroke of directorial genius, Bay ushers the audience into a scene with both aliens and explosions.   What makes this transition all the more engaging, is the fact that our implausibly hot girl has completed two journeys simultaneously and in parallel.   Her journey of discovery is into a scene with both aliens and explosions. That this journey uses as progress indicators the arrival of aliens is not surprising, as it is a microcosmic metaphor of the relentless march toward entropy that we all experience in our lives, as well as observe on the scale of the universe itself. The theme of entropy is enhanced further by the vehement introduction of Bay's SpaceNoizes™.  Her other journey is personal, both to her character, and to the observer. In both scenes with neither aliens nor explosions, as well as in scenes with only aliens, our implausibly hot girl moves at normal speed. However, in scenes with both aliens and explosions, she moves in slow motion. These scenes occur later in the story, and in this way her personal journey reflects our own, forcing the audience to contemplate their mortality, as they are reminded of the fact that as their own lives progress, they too are slowing down.

t5_2qh6c,joejmz,1369774301,"&gt;Who is asserting that the supernatural simply does not exist?  People who insist that life must have started from unplanned, random processes because there is no other way it could happen.  &gt;There is no evidence for the supernatural, and no known way of testing the supernatural, so scientists just don't test it.  I am not arguing this.  I am saying that those who insist the supernatural does not exist because it can't be scientifically proven are engaging in scientism.  &gt; I have nothing to say about the supernatural other than since there is no evidence for it's existence, I don't believe in it. If there is evidence, I will believe in it. I'm completely neutral to it, as are many people I know that share the same views as me.  So you have no problem with the explanation that life was initiated through means that stand outside the scope of science?  &gt;Abiogenesis is the best known explanation for the origin of life as of now, there is plenty of evidence showing that every step of the way is POSSIBLE. The only reason they haven't collected your favorite little 1 million dollar prize, is because they haven't shown conclusively which exact way life DID originate. But that's the kicker, neither have you or anyone else.  Let's clear something up.   The $1,000,000 prize is being offered by an organization that **WANTS** someone, *anyone* to find a viable explanation for abiogenesis:  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - Harvard University is joining the long-running debate over the theory of evolution by launching a research project to study how life began.  The team of researchers will receive $1 million in funding annually from Harvard over the next few years. The project begins with an admission that some mysteries about life's origins cannot be explained.  *“My expectation is that we will be able to reduce this to a very simple series of logical events that could have taken place with no divine intervention,” said David R. Liu, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard.  - *Associated Press, August 15, 2005, “Harvard Jumps Into Evolution Debate”*  **So, what is this prize?**    **""One of the best kept secrets of science is “The Origin of Life Prize” ® sponsored by the Origin of Life Foundation, Inc. When we first ran across their web site (www.lifeorigin.org), we thought that the offer of one million dollars to anyone who could propose a plausible theory for the origin of life was just a slick creationist trick for showing that the emperor had no clothes. We thought that after nobody came forth to claim the prize, the failure could be used to expose the shameful nakedness of the theory of evolution. Closer examination of the website, however, revealed that this has been a genuine effort by evolutionists since 1997 to find the origin of life.**  **All substantive judging has been turned over to the scientific community as represented by nearly 200 judges in over forty countries listed above.** [Judges](http://lifeorigin.org/rul_judg.htm)  **They all seem to be “real” scientists from secular universities.**  **Why haven’t you heard about this prize before? It is because they are trying to keep it a secret.**  *Other than announcements in scientific journals, The Prize will not be publicly advertised in lay media. The Origin-of-Life Foundation, Inc. wishes to keep the project as quiet as possible within the scientific community. No media interviews will be granted until after the Prize is won.*  **Why do you suppose they want to keep it quiet? We suppose that they don’t want to advertise the fact that all the “scientific” theories for the origin of life are contrary to known scientific laws. If you dig deep into their web site, you will find a few of the known problems that the winner must successfully address to claim the prize. Here is just one example,**  *Suppose a self-replicative oligoribonucleo­tide analog sequence occurred spontaneously out of sequence space. How did this self-repli­cative strand simultaneously anticipate folding needs for metabolic utility? Any evolution toward folding fitness would tend to mutate the sequencing away from self-replicative fitness. What was the bridge between both functions? How could random mutations simultaneously contribute to both disparate functions?*  *How did so many biochemical pathways get integrated into one coherent, unified, and sophisticated metabolic process?*  **This isn’t slick creationist rhetoric. We are eavesdropping on evolutionists frankly discussing real technical difficulties with all current origin of life theories. The most telling single sentence on the web page is this one:**  *The winning submission will likely provide both a novel and cardinal conceptual contribution to current biological science and information theory.*   **In other words, the winning submission will no doubt have to be based on a break-through discovery because all previous theories on the origin of life violate current biological science and information theory. Recognizing that contestants will likely appeal to an unknown law of science, the rules specifically say,**  *11. Appeals to unknown laws*  *Appealing to unknown ""laws"" as the source of biological instruction constitutes a ""category error"" of logic theory. ""Laws"" do not cause anything. They are merely human generalizations, mental constructions, and mathematical descriptions of existing forces and mass-energy relationships. Even ""chance"" is a probabilistic rational construct. Neither chance nor ""laws"" cause effects. Unknown laws, therefore, cannot provide a mechanism for prescriptive information (instruction) genesis. Appealing to unknown laws constitutes a ""naturalism of the gaps,"" corresponding to supernaturalists' appealing to a ""God of the gaps"" for scientific explanation. Neither is acceptable in naturalistic science.*  **The rules specifically state that the winning entry must explain where genetic information comes from.**  *6. The source of genetic information in nature*  *No theory of genetic information is complete without a model of mechanism for the source of such prescriptive information within Nature. It is not sufficient for a submission to the Prize to limit discussion of prescriptive information (instruction) theory to its replication, transmission, modification, or matrix of information retention. All submissions must address the source of the prescriptive information through non-supernaturalistic natural processes. Which of the four known forces of physics, or what combination of these forces, produced prescriptive, functional information, and how? What is the empirical evidence for this kind of prescriptive information (instruction) spontaneously arising within Nature? [italics in the original] ""* [The Origin of Life Prize](http://lifeorigin.org/)  [Source](http://scienceagainstevolution.info/v9i11f.htm)  So, the fact that no one has claimed the prize gives the lie to your whole statement about how we have plenty of evidence.  There is NO, evidence AT ALL.  There is a religious BELIEF that life must have started by purely chaotic means since any other explanation requires that a being with significantly more power and intelligence than we is responsible for bringing life about.  As I said, the experiments being carried out to attempt to develop life in the labs is an incredible undertaking, it is an incredible scientific pursuit which will probably yield amazing insights, but they cannot in any way be considered to prove how life began by purely random means.",®

t5_2x5s1,mvlazysusan,1369780515,"I wouldn't expect the ""EU"" to last out this decade if I were you.    The gas off israel is not that substantial a quantity.  Your article fails to include the gas found off Gaza (Palestine).   Your article says the Saudis are in the way also, so let's blame it all on Assad! But not to worry, the Saudi king just died Wednesday ☺ and who knows how things will shake out. *(Better grab some popcorn!)*  Qatar wants to sell that gas and Iran wants to sell the same gas. That may be a key reason that Qatar is trying to stop Assad from bringing the gas to market.   The ""West"" really wants to go to war with Iran, but they won't.   Consider the west like a Knight in shining armer with a trusty steed having armor also and an entourage in attendance. Now consider Iran as a longbow-man. All he has are two stick and a bit of string. Yet the longbow-man slays the knight in shining armor to the point of it's extinction. Six Iranian missiles costing ~ $5,000 each, for a total cost of $30 thousand will kill a Billion dollar American super carrier. And America knows it.

Sometimes as the author of a piece (especially an autobiographical one) its easy to feel like all of your innermost thoughts and feelings make it into your work. I hope you don't assume I meant that the piece fails to evoke emotion- it does. From it, I gather you are a gentle, sensitive sort who cares about the lives (and deaths) of even the smallest of creatures. But I am drawing those conclusions on a lot of assumption. At the beginning of it, you mention your embarrassment for allowing the sparrow to linger in the grill of the car for so long. That's a start to the insights of the emotion you felt- if you can describe how it felt to you, it might be more impactful. We all experience things in different ways, so to say ""my cheeks were hot and flushed with embarrassment and a small stone of guilt had settled in the pit of my stomach"" is more relatable to a general audience. When you are describing the robin, perhaps: ""To see the robin in such a state was disturbing to me. A shiver coiled its way around and down my spine and I put a hand over my mouth to keep from retching"". (These are simply examples- I'm not trying to extrapolate how you felt). I know it bothered you in some way- so I know the emotion is there, but I'm not able to relate to it as easily as if you described it to me.   These are just some thoughts for you to chew on.

Assuming your TV has an S-Video in, you'll need an [S-Video cord](http://www.amazon.com/feet-Gold-Plated-S-Video-Cable/dp/B0002MQGK4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369797135&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=s-video+cable).  If your computer doesn't have an S-Video or HDMI out, it definitely has a VGA out.  VGA doesn't convert well to standard TV in's but there is a chance, if your TV is newer, that it will have a VGA in. If it does, you can connect with a [VGA cord](http://www.amazon.com/SANOXY®-Standard-15-Pin-Male-Cable/dp/B0002AHT0M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369797709&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=vga+cord).  If none of the above options work and you're really desperate you can use a [VGA to HDMI converter](http://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Video-1080P-Converter-Adapter/dp/B008COJXHC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369797979&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=vga+to+hdmi+converter) which is pricey.  Obviously, your TV would need an HDMI in.  Now, the three solutions below the hyphens are only for video.  For Audio you're going to need to run out of your headphone jack which can be done with a [cord like this](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Audio-Cable-Splitter-1-Mini/dp/B00004Z5CP/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369797763&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=headphone+jack+to+rca).  You'll need to make sure that you match the audio cords to the video channel (the video jacks and corresponding audio jacks are usually next to each other on the TV).  If you have a separate speaker system, you can also run the sound straight into that. ",®

t5_2qh5b,deafblindmute,1369801486,"The interesting thing about the vagueness of language is that it's conceptual bleeding not only allows for similar things to be workably grouped together, but it also allows for extremely disparate things to inherit one another's auras and meanings. So let's use what you call the vagueness of language to discuss your initial assumption:  &gt;If this [race having no scientific basis] were true, then medical science would[n't; correct me if that wasn't a typo] rely on race for its treatment, and my dermatologist wouldn't have singled me out for a specific degree of treatment if not for my racial background.  Let's first try to describe your term ""medical science."" Medical science means many things. All at once the term you use points to medical science (a practice), medial science (a group of practitioners), medical science (a long history of hard won discoveries), medical science (a long account of benevolent successes over disease and malady), medical science (the group or groups whose actions led to the inclusions of race as parts of various medical treatments), and medical science (a person in a room with you trying to help you with your skin). What we find here is that ""medical science"" is not just one term, but a complex series of terms, simultaneously separate and entangled with one another.  Mind you, you are only with the one person in the room, and yet, through various ideological vagueries that person comes to be inhabited by all of the story, pomp, and trustworthiness of the entire apparatus. Simultaneously, that person ceases to be a person and is instead an avatar for that same apparatus. It is most likely that a great effort has been made by a number of people to be certain that the person you are in the room with is talented and knowledgeable in the ways of bettering the dermis. And yet, this doctor in the room with you is but one person (with all the room for subjectivity and error of a person, albeit a highly trained one).  Indeed, the same goes true for every person who falls somewhere within that monumental term ""medical science."" If the entire monument is capable of infinite victories, then, being composed of nothing more than mortal humans, it must also be capable of infinite failures. But, being composed of people, and people generally do as best as they can, I’d guess that the whole of medical science does about even. Heck, I’d go one further—since medical science (or any science) works to build some collective momentum out of all of those people’s efforts it probably does above average (I know, it sounds like jab; but think about it, if anything with a huge, ancient history is doing better than neutral, that’s pretty freakin’ awesome).  But, for all the good it means to be in the black (mildly funny since were are in the middle of a conversation on race; anyone? anyone? fine…) medical science still has lots of missteps. Those missteps don’t have to be, “someone go tell her family.” They could be, “shit, we really could have been doing that better.” For instance, up until recently MEDICAL SCIENCE™ had the techniques for recognizing a heart attack slightly wrong for women. They weren’t all the way off, but there are probably a few people we couldn’t save because we didn’t think to ask, “so, do you think these might look different for women?”  Could race not be the same way? Could your dermatologist (or the people who wrote the study your dermatologist read) not be missing some helpful info because they are using the wrong terminology or making the wrong assumptions? There are sizable portions of the medical community that very vocally state that race is not a useful term in medical science and they actively seek to end its use through study (correct me if I am wrong but the medical communities in the Netherlands and Sweden have each made collective statements disavowing the use of race as a medical/scientific determinate entirely).  But wait, I’m just warming up (hopefully not literally; I have written so much already). Let’s look back to the aura transference between individuals who somehow fall under the term, “medical science.” At least in part, your dermatologist carries some of the features of the monument concept of “medical science.” Would it not make sense for the same thing to occur with terms like “black” or “Asian.” You could argue that these terms might not transfer aura as strongly since ideas of medical science and doctors involve specific training, but you should be able to understand the way in which transference of aura still occurs (I would actually argue that since the primary part of our conception of race is biological, even though our method of reading is primarily cultural/historical, there is just as much aura transference, but it occurs in perhaps more subtle ways at times).  If I come from a society in which I am told, “race is a real thing and it signals some actual differences,” when I see someone I will unconsciously take note of their features. This will go on and on and it will go far beyond the people I actually meet. I will take note of representations of race in media, I will take note of how groups are discussed in conversation, I will take note of how people around me react to people marked of a certain race, I will take note of **absences** of certain races, and after all of that (and in ever compounding fashion) I will take note of all my responses to these internalized notes and throw them onto the pile. If I can be taught anything of the concept “there are normal people and there are other people,” then my mind will make space to start finding ways to distinguish and separate the other people, even if I am one of those other people myself.  In essence, a race becomes a totem and those people who are marked with that race, inherit the features of that totem (not always in entirety, but very often in part).  **TL;DR: Just like we give trust to science (as a cultural totem) other concepts (e.g. specific races) can become totems and project their auras. These totems can then serve as separations between ""normal people"" and ""other people."" This separation, affecting the perceptions of both the ""normal"" and ""other people,"" both leads to and makes room for systems of privilege and oppression.**  *You’ll have to forgive me. This has become an obscenely long post (among many long posts today) and I feel that I have become tired and inarticulate in the lattermost portion. If you make it through all of this and feel like conversing further, perhaps I could gather more energy tomorrow/the next time I have Internet access.*",™

t5_2qh13,AvraKedavrai,1369814417,"No, you're making fallacious appeals to authority and ignoring science.  **I am a biologist.**  Respond to *any* of the terms in this abstract:  &gt;Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup®, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise. Residues are found in the main foods of the Western diet, comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat. Glyphosate's inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Here, we show how interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We explain the documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and we show that glyphosate is the “textbook example” of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins.  You are confusing glyphosate toxicity with gmo's generally.  Stop being a shill.",®

t5_2sgp1,DramaLlamaKarmaFarma,1369816309,"I'm going to disagree with you on this one.  Few people dispute that DRM can work well and that it can make things easier. Valve has built an entire business around it and set the bar for DRM Done Right™. The problem is that DRM is still it's a shitty solution and horribly implemented in most other situations.  I'll address some specific points.  &gt;How many games or products did you lose because these ""evil"" companies decided to steal your money and take away the product from you? I bet none.   To be fair, the video game industry is extremely young, and DRM in its more intrusive forms (like always-on DRM) are even younger. Gamers are entirely at the mercy of the publishers when it comes to DRM like this. We can already see the effects in Diablo III and SimCity Online.  &gt;And it has been said repeatedly that if Valve goes under you will have time to get all your games. I just don't understand the entitlement that some people have.  I don't doubt that Valve will keep their word, but as far as I know, they don't have any legal obligation to do so. Similarly, they have no obligation to give your purchased games to a family member or friend after you die. Games without DRM would never have this issue.  &gt;YOU FUCKING DOWNLOADED A GAME OFF AN ONLINE STORE. How the hell are you supposed to ""own it"" like you would a physical copy when it's downloaded?  Because in a lot of places, such as Australia, purchasing video games online is still *very* expensive, and only marginally cheaper than buying a physical copy. It stands to reason that it should be significantly cheaper to buy a *license* to a game than to buy the game itself.  &gt;From the business point of view its a way to ensure that their product isn't stolen. But fuck them right? Wanting to protect their assets. These business's don't want to screw you over they just to make it so it's fair for them too.   The big issue with DRM is that it's getting worse and worse, and publishers are starting to really shit over their legitimate customers to try and protect their assets. Valve is doing the right thing with Steam, but other publishers are making things so difficult for legitimate customers that it's easier to download a pirated copy with the DRM removed than it is to play legitimately. Look EA's fuckup with SimCity.  &gt;Also why not love Steam? It's a very easy place to get your games in a very organized fashion, it's safe, they have great promotions for games I have never heard of, and it is pretty much hassle free. It's also a community, friends, groups, profiles.  This is exactly why Steam is so great. Every publisher should either be using Steam or following its standard for customer friendliness.  But that said, I will always choose to buy DRM-free when the prices are comparable.",™

The more RAM, the better the performance, and the FreeNAS® Forums provide anecdotal evidence from users on how much performance is gained by adding more RAM.

t5_2qhad,deviantsource,1369840704,"Background: I'm a Christian and am involved in another church in Seattle.  Story 1: I've attended Mars Hill on several occasions with friends who go there (or more specifically: used to go there). Every single time - I had a literal sense of foreboding evil by the time I left, and was quite angry at the spectacle I'd just witnessed. Mark Driscoll Christianity© is a scary thing. While I'm all for people getting involved in a Church, I (and many others) are concerned about what we see as an inevitable collapse of Mars Hill where thousands of regular Church attenders will no longer be attending Church because they have been so indoctrinated by Mark Driscoll Christianity© that they will find any other 'brand' to be not as XHARDXCOREX as they want, not realizing that Mark's brand is a little off base.  Story2: One of the times I went, he brought his wife up on stage with him. I wanted to run up and hug her because she seemed so incredibly submissive and beaten down (not physically). He was incredibly condescending to her and it really broke my heart to see. In his book on marriage/sexuality (TANGENT: Every single one of his messages I've seen involves sex in some way - usually negatively), he reveals that he and his wife both cheated on each other physically whilst engaged. He makes a HUGE deal out of his forgiving her and how it makes him such a saintly person, but seems to brush aside the fact that she forgave him too as being her womanly duties.  Story3: TL;DR God told the leaders of the church that two of their staffers should get married after they'd been dating casually for a few short months. Mother of the bride expressed concern to the couple that it was sudden and that she didn't think her daughter was super into the guy. Church leaders got wind, forbade the couple from speaking to her parents and posted security so that the parents couldn't attend the wedding. The mother is a family friend, and I've no reason to doubt her account. And yes, this is the TL;DR version - the longer one is even worse.  TL;DR - Mars Hill is doing few things right, but a lot of things that have great potential for harm.",©

t5_2w2s8,carasci,1369842874,"Even if it wasn't lead by a religious authority figure it would probably still be unacceptable if it were specifically condoned, sanctioned or scheduled by the school.  (Presuming a public school.  Private schools are a different can of worms.)  Basically, if the valedictorian sticks a prayer into their speech independent of the school, that's perfectly legal/okay even though many (most?) might think it kind of stupid.  However, if a school official (religious or not) stands up at the beginning and says ""and now we're going to have a prayer"" (or it's in the program, or anything similar) then a public school *probably* should not be doing so.  The OP's problem seems to be less with the presence or absence of prayer than the singling out and endorsing of one specific religion.  As an atheist I personally find all forms of prayer in public (especially in nominally secular venues) rather offensive and annoying, but everyone still has the right to do so and I'm okay with that so long as my right *not* to do so is equally respected.  This seems to be a similar issue: a generic ""moment of reflection and/or prayer"" would be fine, but a mandated ""and now for some 100% all-natural Christian™ prayer"" would not.",™

t5_2qh2p,pseudonym1066,1369858514,"&gt;It's funny that people who claim to be open minded end up being the most closed minded people.   [Here's a great video on open mindedness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T69TOuqaqXI) which expresses my views succintly.  I actually saw a ghost once as well. I was entering the laundry room and it appeared out of nowhere - a ghostly white face in the darkness slowly moving around. I genuinely thought it was a ghost.  It really frightened me and I said ""aaargh"". The ghost turned around, and I realized it was one of my flatmates. She had very pale skin, and she was in a very dark room wearing dark clothes, and her face appeared to hover in the darkness. For a split second I thought I saw a real spirit. Obviously it wasn't one though, as when I got a better look I realized it was my flatmate.  So I'm not ridiculing you for claiming to have seen a ghost. However, remember that one of the things that is really important for us as a species is the ability to recognise faces. A sentence said with a smile has a totally different meaning to the same sentence said with a frown. So our brains have adapted to look for faces everywhere. A circle with two dots and a semi circle is interpreted as a face ☺. So our brains are always looking for faces. Sometimes they get fooled - like the face on Mars. Seeing faces on human body shapes is not evidence of foolishness, its evidence of being human. And these sorts of things happen particularly often when there is less information eg when the lights are low.  Notice however, I'm not saying ""You're wrong, ghosts dont exist"". I'm saying ""I know of no good evidence for it, and would invite someone claiming they exist to present me with evidence"". As we can both agree the human eye-brain system can be easily fooled.  Also, bear in mind that our brains typically see things in patterns all the time that aren't there, so called [pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia). Its easy to see things that aren't there.   &gt;there's more to life than reason.   I agree in the sense that one can enjoy a piece of music or a film just by being swept up in your emotional feelings. That's a valid way to appreciate the arts for example.  I would dispute however that it is a good way of resolving how things happen in nature.   &gt;There is an infinite possibly of things that we don't know exist.  I would agree. But to claim that things *do* exist without proof means accepting pretty much any statement that comes along.   Maybe supernatural claims are real. I would be happy if there were new evidence. It would be exciting. But I have absolutely no evidence for them at all, and neither does anyone in the scientific community.  However if you have evidence of such things - go ahead and present them to the JR Education Foundation - [and you can claim a $1 million prize.](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html).  I don't believe in supernatural phenomena because I don't believe in anything unless evidence is presented. However I keep an open mind, and would be happy if good evidence came along. That is true open mindedness.",☺

t5_2qhpm,Awkward_Lubricant,1369859769,"Oh *that's* the most disturbing part?  Really?  Right.  The conditions of animals in our modern meat factories are fucking terrible, no doubt about it.  But comparing those animals to dogs is not the same.  Dogs have been bred to be friendly, intelligent, loyal companions who develop strong bonds with their owners (unaware of the state of these dogs, but it is reasonable to assume they've been influenced by selective breeding).  Have you spent much time around cows or chickens?  They are pretty fucking dumb.  I can't speak on pigs since I haven't spent much time around them but I hear they're pretty smart.  Once again, I'm not saying that what's happening in meat factories isn't horrendous (it absolutely is) but to compare a chicken to a dog is silly. Also, most people *would* bat an eye if they saw that but they choose to be blissfully ignorant (or are completely unaware).  Anyway, your post in general reeks of the generic extremist twattery that dampens an important movement so I felt compelled to reply.  Now downvote away you silly gooses, for your offended sensibilities can only be satiated by periwinkle arrows. ♥",♥

Tall enough to walk down the street,    And stare in the eye, any man who came my way.     Why am I punished thus? Yesterday this     Chair, this desk, this building stood here and    All was well. Today, I am ruined,    Yet building, desk and chair are all untouched.    Why am I punished? I am still Bernard.    Do pencil marks on a scrap of paper    Mean the end of the world? Am I not a    Father? Grandfather? Husband? Lover? Friend?    How am I to make sense of all of this?     What God has such a sense of humor, that    He would elevate me to the roof of     The very world, only to yank it away,    Leaving empty desert sands to the horizon.    Why am I punished? For breaking some rule?    What rule? What justice? I know better than    Anyone, success comes to he who forges his    Own path and does not follow the    Well-worn groove of mediocrity.     There is not one action I have taken,    Not one deal I have crafted, that was not    Copied a thousand times over by every    Bank and investment hack on this same street.    Why am I punished? What is my sin?    Do the others, each morning face a thousand    Greedy, clamoring princes that demand     Profits without sacrifice? Demand that     Money, stinking, reeking money, flow like    A river of filth into the maw of bottomless    Desire? Desire that knows no bounds,    That cannot be tempered or fulfilled?    I am swallowed by greed, I am chewed     And spat out by the god of profit.    I am destroyed by that howling mob who    Do not want more kindness, or beauty, or     A better world in which to spend their days.

t5_2fwo,RED_5_Is_ALIVE,1369879534,"&gt; The function only purports to do a CAS on the target address, and it does that.  The question is, why call it ""_relaxed"" when it includes synchronization:  ""For the P6 family processors, locked operations serialize all outstanding load and store operations (that is, wait for them to complete)"" Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1 (page 8-4  / section 8.1.2.2)     &gt; Of course you know that the compiler can reorder instructions. ""memory"" prohibits such reordering around the asm block   I'm not sure where you're getting that; I quoted the compiler documentation.  It has to do with caching values in registers, not reordering.  I'm not sure what example you have in mind that includes a reordering when there's a `cmpxchg` instruction.  Reorder what, where?    &gt; Also note that even the C++11 atomic library functions are sometimes just wrappers around an equals sign.  This is the wrong reason to do something.  (Can't wait for someone will come along and overload `=` and the circle will be complete.)  The problem is, wrappers like that and this tend to obscure what's actually happening, while still demanding you know what's happening.    Otherwise you wonder why `mint_store_64_relaxed` is so slow on 32-bit, and end up having to make a separate 32-bit version anyway to elide unnecessary uses of multi-word atomic operations, and to know when adding memory fences is redundant after which instructions on which platform.

Anyway, Skip lived many great days in South Central LA, he rarely ever used his assault rifle. Those few times he did though, were not the best ways he could have handled the situations. You see, Skip had anger management issues, and while he tried his hardest, there were times he lost control. A time that stands out the most, is the incident with the Doughnut boy. Skip had been at the bakery to get his usual morning doughnut and coffee. While Skip was ordering his bear claw, the man behind the counter told Skip that the bear claws would not be ready until 9:45. Skip thought that was strange, because the bear claws were always ready by 9:40. Skip then proceeded to go to his car, acquire his assault rife, and pump the oven full of lead. I may have overstated how hard Skip tried to manage his anger. Skip was immediately arrested, and was not able to post bail, because he had horrible people skills and was not very apt at carrying trays. At his trial, Skip was sentenced to 3-5 years in a mid-security state penitentiary. Skip accepted his sentence, although he did not like the word choice. In the beginning, Skip did not particularly enjoy prison, although he preferred it to working 26 hours a week at Rocco's Bar and Grill ""Where the only thing hotter than the waitresses are the chicken wings!©"". After a year of prison life, Skip discovered a certain structure he never had felt before, and when he heard his sentence was up, he grew severely depressed. Skip found the only alternative to leaving to be suicide.   No one cried.",©

Then other tags you can read from a mile away.  To put it another way, I saw this really simple tag. Nothing special, just the name and a star, except that name was 'Berst©'. Seeing a Berst tag isn't cool because he wrote ""Berst"" really fancy (it was clean as fuck, just simple), seeing a Berst tag is cool because I think ""oh shit Berst was here"" (he's not local to that area at all) and he's got the history he has. So I guess the point of this tangent is don't rely on being fancy, rely on being everywhere. ",©

t5_2qh30,sime,1369909913,"I think the negativity comes from a lot of misunderstanding and some ignorance among front-end web developers.  What counts as front-end web programming has become very wide and can be seen as a spectrum:      web site ↔ web application     web pages ↔ user interface  Most people are working in the web site / web page end of the spectrum and are just looking for a better way of doing templating. Hence, the initial reaction to the templating system used and the mixing of HTML and JS.  So of us are busy building web applications which are not strongly page structured but aim for more traditional style GUIs like in desktop applications. Here, templating is less important but components, encapsulation and composition become very important.  React is clearly aiming more towards the  web application end of the spectrum.  The AngularJS version ( https://medium.com/make-your-own-apps/e71bcedc36b ) is interesting, but it comes from the web site point of view and also completely misses the point. It is simple but also monolithic. It is a style of programming which doesn't scale up for complex applications.  React actually looks like quite an interesting data point on the web site/web app spectrum. ",↔

t5_2qh61,DJDanaK,1369912553,"&gt;to me it looks like you're rejecting my experience as anecdotal, and using your own as the truth.      &gt;Doesn't matter if it's detrimental to me, because it's the truth.      You must realize, having chatted with me for a while, that not one single time have I said these women do or do not protect their abusers, despite my experience. Do you want to know why? Because my experience does not mean I am an all-knowing domestic abuse expert who can make a claim whether ""a lot"" of women in these situations do this. Your evidence and experience are anecdotal - you say you know The Truth™, I say no one knows for sure. I am right, but not because of my experience. *Neither* of our experiences qualify us to say ""very often"" or ""a lot"".    The fact that you are refusing to even admit you may not be 100% correct, no matter what, is sad, because whether or not the ""victims are only victims"", they still need help. Pardon me if I don't jump on the same train of thought with someone who never once filed a police report, or from what I understand, called the police in the first place because *you didn't want your roommates to know you cared* and *you couldn't get a ride to the police station* after you *definitely hung out right outside of 'countless' abused women's doors* and *cell phones weren't very popular so this takes place at least 10 years ago but it's still correct TODAY* and *hey guys, I was poor once, that means I'm an expert who should be completely excused for not once doing the right thing... right*?      It's clear that you value your opinion above the needs and problems of others. You have no credibility and it's offensive that you think you do - in reality you just sound like every other teenager who thinks they know everything about the world. I am not asking you to withold your opinion on this matter but rather not to talk about it like it were gospel, or try and promote it as being ""The Truth™"", because you can't back any of it up. The people who are targeted by your ignorance already need help - but like you said, it doesn't matter to you. Good luck being an all-knowing deity.",™

t5_2qstm,aBoglehead,1369930897,"&gt;My initial plan was to save up that emergency nest egg...  Good...  &gt;...until I could afford to pay off the student loan in one swoop (with enough emergency funds left over) so in case something did happen between, I'd have that money available.  I'd guess your $12k in student debt carries an interest rate around 6%.  If you saved up all $12k for a year, the interest would be around $740.  If you paid it down steadily, at $1500/month, you'd save $450.  I'd say paying down steadily is worth it.  &gt;I've heard of a Roth account, but don't know much about it (Thanks for the link).  You contribute after-tax money to the Roth IRA.  You can withdraw the principle at any time, and after age 59.5 you can withdraw the earnings tax-free.  You can also withdraw earnings before age 59.5 for certain things like buying your first home.

t5_2urg0,Terr_,1369931666,"&gt; Did you leave out the step where you had to swap colors  By ""now darkened"" I meant:  1. You use Rhino / Hek for a long time in one theme (e.g. a ""Captain America"" red/white/blue)  2. You change favorites to another (e.g. ""Batman"" Black/Yellow) 3. Your currently-equipped Rhino / Hek is now the new colors 4. When you switch to something else in your inventory, like Ash / Latron, they're already the new colors too.  &gt; Also, it is clumsy because of how you described it. Your wording is a bit hard to follow.  "" 'When *I* use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.' ""  &gt; Color slots can either be assigned a color, or be bound to a Favorite Slot. Changing the color of a Favorite Slot would change all colors bound to that Favorite Slot.  Nope, your wording just encourages them to misinterpret a ""Favorite Slot"" as named collection of multiple colors, particularly if they misread or infer an ""s"" into the second sentence.

t5_2qh3k,accountiberius1,1369932154,"I like this response the best (of all the sensible, non-astroturfing/fanboy ones), from user ""mkautzman"":  ---  This is so unfortunate.  It's great that there is an effort within Microsoft to improve and move forward, but it's one that's tainted by delusional design and as much as we hear this:  ""Windows 8.1 respond to customer feedback""  That isn't, and hasn't been the case with Windows 8. Yes, there are some neat features that are being added.  SkyDrive could be very cool, but for every functional feature like that, we get 'can take pictures on lock screen.'  There are so many features that exactly zero people have asked for and it seems to have come at the cost of an actual user experience.  Would it really crush your ego so much to include a Window 7-esq Start Menu, or at least equivalent functionality?  Consider that with said Start Menu, I am three clicks away from an endless list of items without having to touch a keyboard, without having to 'look for' anything, without having to abandon my desktop.  Windows 8 hasn't replaced that kind of functionality and it looks like it will continue to attempt to develop something 'cool' instead of something functional.  Swallow your pride before it starts to damage you and abandon whatever righteous mission you thought you had with Windows 8.  Hot corners suck with traditional PC and OSX demonstrated that years ago.  No one wants to deal with a touch interface when you have a mouse.  It takes up way too much space.  There is a reason why third-party applications like Start8 are so popular. People are willing to spend money for a proper Start Menu.  Take a hint.  Please, for sake of my sanity and everyone else's, take a hint.  Really, the theme of this entire debacle is 'functionality'.  Windows 7 had it and it was and continues to be the OS of choice for many because Windows 8 isn't.  That's what 8.1 should be about:  Restoring functionality.  Instead it's about adding more dumb toys that no one asked for, integrating Bing and a Windows Store™ that no one asked for and trying to build a desktop OS around a touch interface that no one asked for.  Great job on delivering a product that no one asked for.  ---  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Well, I could, but it would have had more swearing.",™

t5_2qstm,FinancialThrow,1369934625,"I had to look up an income stub for this one:)  Paycheck Gross: 5008 every half month (or 10,016 per month). Taxes per pay period are about 1390 (2780 per month). I take home about 7440 per month.  My bonus for the last 9 months has been 17k pre-tax, and about 10k post tax (38% tax on commissions, a lot of that comes back at tax time). So let's call this 1100 a month.  This means my income is say $8,550 per month. Below are my expenses:  * 30 Year Mortgage: $1629 * Groceries: $1000 * Credit Card Minimums: $600 (rate averages about 8%) * Wife's “Meds”: $500 (trying to solve this) * 15 Year Mortgage (avoids PMI): $298 * Insurance for Life, Cycle, Cars: $250 * Gasoline: $250 * Spending Money: $250 * Gym: $168 (we dont take vacations, the outdoor pool is our fun time) * Household Goods (TP, shampoo, etc): $150 * TV: $100 * Electric: $100 * Heat: $100 * Water: $100 * Clothing: $100 * Pet Food: $100 * Wifes Cell: $70 * Netflix and Rhapsody: $30 * Fish Tank Maintenance: $20 (saltwater)  Those Expenses total $5,815, which would normally leave $2,735 for debt payment.  However there are some things like birthdays, date nights, etc that I should budget for and don’t. Also, this year medical has only been maybe 5k out of pocket / 1000 a month or so (not counting the meds), but some years it has been much worse. The medical is a permanent nerve condition, friends I work with tell me to move to Canada for free health care☺  My wifes “meds” in quotes is mostly for medical marijuana (I quit pot and pills, she just quit pills). She is in treatment for the addiction and it should go away within 6 months I hope. I am trying to be supportive, but the 500 a month is hard.  Now eat me up! I know there is crap I should be budgeting for and not, and there is wasteful spending too. I also know I should be paying off more than I am.  ",☺

t5_2r2o9,cutchyacokov,1369946311,"&gt; I'd love for people to reply about why this theory is ridiculous and break down the reasons why, because for my mind now, the story would be a mile better if the Tower of Joy baby is Aegon, rather than Jon, in almost every circumstance.  It isn't ridiculous at all, it's quite plausible as far as theories like this go but I think R + L = J is still a stronger theory and Aegon is a Blackfyre is at least as strong as R + L =A.   I do, however, have some issues with your friends arguments against R + L = J  &gt; Tyrion notes Young Griff to be ~2 years younger than Aegon-Original should be.  * This doesn't affect the Aegon Blackfyre theory. * It's a false dichotomy there are more possibilities beyond the three mentioned so far. * This could simply be characterizing Young Griff as immature and possibly not fit for the throne, there are many examples of this in both Tyrion and JonCon chapters.  &gt; If Jon Connington is handed a new born babe at a time when Aegon-Original would be about 2 years old, he'd know that it's an imposter. We get the impression from his POV chapters that Young Griff is legitimately Rhaegar's son.  * We don't know when JonCon was introduced to Aegon, it may have been some years later. * See my first two points.  &gt; If R+L=J, then that means Varys and Illyrio must have come up with a grand, GRAND scheme to replace Aegon-Original before the sack of KL, whisk him off to the Free Cities, but not Rhaenys for some reason, and then hope that the Mountain smashes the face of Not-Aegon into unrecognisable smithereens -or- Aegon-Original isn't replaced before the sack of KL and did actually die but then Varys and Illyrio pretend that they did whisk him off and hand over a replacement baby to Jon Connington that would still not fit the age gap he should be and would question the legitimacy of claiming the baby is Rhaegar's.  * My first two points apply yet again. * Elia may have been worried with the rebellion and all and may have planned the decoy herself. Everyone who knew about it could have ended up dead other than a certain individual who was told by some little birds.  * Rhaenys may have objected to being separated from her mother in the way a young baby couldn't. * It would be *far* more difficult to replace Rhaenys with a convincing decoy.  &gt; Eddard would have risked taking a babe back to Winterfell that would have grown up with Targeryen features that would have been extremely obvious to any onlookers.  * I don't think eye colour changes significantly after birth, it would have been obvious whether Jon's eyes were grey or violet. Newborns don't usually have that much hair and it usually starts out very light but they usually have at least some hair and if it was already *at least* Lannister blond chances are his hair would end up at least fairly dark. It would have needed to be near pure white to end up looking Targaryen. So it should have been easy enough to tell that he would pass for Eddards son even when he was a newborn.  &gt; It gives Eddard a flaw, a weakness. It makes for a good character if he did actually dishonour his marriage for a woman he truly loved  * No argument there. Although I think lying to everyone, including his wife about this for so many years especially when it was so hard on Cat, would be compelling storytelling and characterization as well.  &gt; It fits the story better, thematically. If R+L=J, then what? He'll be the one to save the Kingdom and also end up as King? Think of all the instances GRRM has specifically set out to avoid cliches like that  * Even if Jon is the ""rightful heir"" he still may not become king. * Even if Jon seems like he is the hero so far he may not end up that way.  &gt; It's easier to explain in the last 2 books. Who can confirm R+L=J now? Howland Reed. Who can confirm R+L=A? Howland Reed still, plus perhaps Varys, Illyrio, Ashara and Jon Connington. Is GRRM basically going to have Howland Reed turn up as some kind of deus ex machina to say ""Oh by the way guys, Jon Snow is really the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and should thus be King. I know there's no other evidence but you can trust me""  * This point is valid but there are still other possible ways that R + L =J could be revealed. Melisandre and her ""power in king's blood,"" for example. Howland Reed may simply confirm rather than reveal.  * GRRM may have written himself into a tight spot. I certainly hope not but it definitely can happen with his writing style. See: [Meereenese knot](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/37635-so-what-is-this-meereenese-knot-martin-is-referring-to-on-his-not-a-blog/)  &gt; It still fits Young Griff being the Mummer's Dragon in the HOTU vision. He claims to be THE Aegon. He is still an Aegon, and is still the son of Rhaegar.  * See my first two points yet again.  &gt; Varys still does not lie about Aegon's return. The only difference being that Kevan assumes a different Aegon  * All that is required for this to be a Varys Truth™ is that his name must be Aegon and he must be from Westros.  &gt; Ned told Jon they'd talk about his mother. Would Ned have seen him again and been all like ""Psyche! I'm not really going to tell you"". He could have told him it was Ashara Dayne, and it would have been fine.  * Why couldn't Ned reveal Jon's Targaryen heritage to him at this point? It would then be up to Jon to keep it to himself. * Even if Jon talked about it and it got back to King Robert he would have been a member of the Night's Watch by then, Robert didn't go after Maester Aemon, hopefully he wouldn't touch Jon either.  EDIT: I thought of two major points that make R + J = A seem really unlikely.  &gt; Promise me Ned.  What did Lyanna make Ned promise? That he would take her son to a weird eunuch that should take him to Essos and raise him to be king when the time is right to topple Robert? Perhaps Ned felt guilty about not making or not keeping the promise but then how the hell did Varys find Aegon? Maybe there is a compelling way to connect these dots but I certainly don't see it yet.  The name Aegon. Aegon would have been ""Young Griff's"" half brother. That seems like a very odd choice for a name especially if Lyanna didn't know he was dead during the events at ToJ. Wouldn't any other Targaryen name make more sense? Why didn't she name him Rhaegar? or Aerys? or how about Aemon? or Jaehaerys? Naming him after his older brother makes the least sense.",™

t5_2qh9a,gordonite,1369952771,"Asaad is bad. He is part of a ruling minority that makes it hard for most everyone else. When people protested, inspired by Egypt and all, he started killing everyone. So they started rebelling. That is not the complicated part. It's complicated because there are too many rebels to reliably get Asaad out and have a favorable government set up.  I learned much from this article, though it doesn't explain why Asaad is bad, and it is from the USA viewpoint, http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/13/130513fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all  *When I asked him to predict Syria’s future, he got up from his desk and walked over to a large map of the country which was tacked to his wall. “You could have a situation where the more secular rebel groups could well be fighting the more Islamist-oriented groups,” he said. “We are already getting that in places like Deir ez-Zor, in the east. In Aleppo, they fight each other.” Pointing to an area near the Turkish border, he said, “We see fighting between Kurdish and Arab militias up in the north.” Elsewhere, there were Druze militias, members of a small religious community most often associated with Lebanon. “They have had some clashes with the Free Syrian Army. And here is my favorite. Christians are now setting up their own militia.*  *The rapid growth of Al Qaeda in Syria is deeply troubling, he said. “In February, 2012, they were tiny. No more than a few dozen. Now, fast-forward fourteen months. They are in Aleppo. They are in Damascus. They are in Homs.” In Iraq, he said, “They didn’t grow so fast and they didn’t cover all the big cities. In Syria, they do.” Also, he pointed out, there were no chemical weapons in Iraq, as there are in Syria. “We will have a greater risk, the longer this goes on, that the bad guys—they are all bad guys, but I mean terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Islamist extremist groups—will acquire some of these weapons. How do you plan for that? The longer the war goes on, the more the extremists will gain.” Indeed, the longer the war goes on, the greater the threat that it will engulf the entire region.*  *The official said that the United States’ quandary was clear enough: “Iraq was a searing experience—to see our kids out there, out on those checkpoints, and they don’t speak Arabic, and they don’t know what the fuck is going on around them. I know there is a debate on military intervention. I cannot recommend it to the President unless there is a very clearly defined political way back out. People on the Hill ask me, ‘Why can’t we do a no-fly zone? Why can’t we do military strikes?’ Of course we can do these things. The issue is, where does it stop?” ♦*",♦

t5_2rffj,MondoHawkins,1369968018,"The two NHL licensed options for current jerseys from Reebok are Premier and Authentic.   An Authentic is supposed to be a replica of what the players wear.   From the NHL Shop:  &gt;The Reebok® EDGE authentic hockey jersey replicates the jersey worn by all NHL® players on the ice. It features a combination of stitched-embroidery and twill-appliqué team crests; the new Reebok® wordmark is embroidered on the back of the neck and sleeve. X-trafil fabric provides additional reinforcement in the shoulder and elbow areas, while PlayDry® performance Lycratalic is featured in the neck collar.  $250 is a good for an Authentic if you can find one at that price, but $300 is more common.  Premiers are made from an entirely different jersey material. It's thin and cheap compared to the real thing. The piping is different. It has ribs that are not present on player's jerseys, and it's a cheaper material as well. The numbers and letters are pretty good, but not as good as the real thing. Premiers don't have the fight strap that a real jersey does. The shoulders and elbows are not double layered like a real jersey is. The logo on the front seems to be the only thing of the same quality.  Personal opinion from here on.  I find it ridiculous that they charge so much for such a cheap product. When I can buy uncrested Kings style practice jerseys for under $40, there's no reason they should be charging $150 for the inferior product they laughingly call a Premier. I can take a chance on three fakes at $40 a pop and still be ahead of the game.  The Authentic might be worth it if you want a licensed jersey, and don't mind paying that much. I don't own one, so I can't comment on it. As I said earlier though, I'd pay a bit more and get a [game worn](http://gameworn.net).   The only problem with a game worn is that it's sized to fit the player with pads on, and they are big boys. Part of the reason I picked a Stoll jersey is because he's one of the smaller guys on the team. I still look like a kid wearing his dad's clothes with it on, but whatevs. It's a conversation starter, and I love it. Seeing a photo match of Stoll wearing it on ice was pretty cool too. ",®
t5_2sgq6,thedarkerside,1369968208,"&gt; Perhaps the reason that there aren't more (and we're both talking out of our ass here because there are no definitive numbers on hardcore female gamers) is because the gaming community is such an insular boy's club.  Yes we are. But here is why I think you may be wrong: The industry wants more money. They don't produce ""boys club games"" because they are a boys club. Companies like EA are way to beholden to profit targets. If they thought investing into a AAA Feminist Frequency Approved™ game would actually make them a profit they'd be on it.  More likely: Most women just don't care. I do not know a lot of women that actually enjoy computer games (that is, stuff that doesn't play on their iPhone / Android while they sit on the bus) and it's not the topics that are a turn off it's mostly a ""time waster"" for them. They rather play board games (social interaction) or hang out on facebook. Again, personal observation on that end on my part.  &gt; First of all, this is a twelve part series.   Yes, and at the rate she's releasing we'll get the final instalment late 2014.  &gt; Second of all, this is a critique, her job isn't to look for solutions but to point out the problems and spark conversation, and that is a valuable role when people still vehemently deny that there is any problem.  That's a cop-out. Out of two reasons:  1. The current consumer of the media seem to get exactly what they want. So no denial there because they don't feel ""deprived"" so to speak. 2. The ""silent masses"" that Sarkeesian et. al. seem to speak for are remarkably silent. It's a bit like Norway where they still can't figure out why not more women go into engineering. They've pretty much tried everything and yet, women still by and large have no interest in it.  If Sarkesian really thinks that girls stay away from games because games are anti-women then she has not shown it anywhere in her previous published work, nor do I expect that this series will accomplish this as she seems to be picking small little data points to support her belief.  But hey, as you said, another 20 months before we know what she really wants to tell us.",™

Levine is a PHD in biology and psychology and has drawn on a lot of biological research on the autonomic nervous system and observations of wild animals responses to natural ""trauma"" (i.e. predation etc).  In his latest book Levine uses the concepts of Stephen Porges (author of The Polyvagal Theory) to shed light on his approach. This advanced understanding of the autonomic nervous system and it's relationship with the evolutionary development of the human brain helps illuminate the way this much more experiencial body based therapy can enable change where our traditionally more cognitive and linguistic approaches typically fail.

Here's their notice:  In order to ensure the best email migration experience possible for customers, we will no longer utilize the current migration tool in the control panel, beginning on March 31st, 2013. To provide better service to our customers, we have partnered with a 3rd party vendor, MigrationWiz, for email migration services moving forward. MigrationWiz is a small company that focuses solely on email migrations. Our internal Email On-Boarding team has been using MigrationWiz to migrate customers to Rackspace Email and Microsoft Exchange 2010 for the past year and we are now ready to allow you to perform your own migrations using this new service. Access to this new tool will be available from within the email Control Panel.  The detailed timetable for this end-of-life schedule is as follows:  Â· Removal of existing tool from within the Email Control Panel â€“ March 31st, 2013 Â· Launch of new migration service, MigrationWiz, inside the Email Control Panel â€“ March 31st, 2013 Â· Removal of all access to the old migration tool â€“ April 12th, 2013  Why are you doing this?  The migration of customer email data is a complex and involved process. Our expertise is on hosting email so we have partnered with vendor who specializes in making sure the migration process is a smooth transition for customers.  Is there a cost associated with this new tool?  Yes, there is a cost associated with using the new tool. Customers who elect to migrate their own email data using MigrationWiz will pay a $5.00 per mailbox fee, which includes multiple passes to ensure that all mail is migrated during the transition. Customers who elect to have Rackspace migrate their data will pay a fee of $10.00 per mailbox.  Although we regret the inconvenience that sun-setting any product brings, we are extremely excited the new email migration tools. Weâ€™re confident that the functionality and experience of this new service will help make your migration experience that much better.",™

t5_2s3qj,hak8or,1370017634,"Apperntally no one read my breakdown of specifically how this is a scam, from the tech side.  &gt;For people who want more proof this is a scam, lets throw some layman science at this and see just how much bounces back. &gt; &gt;Lets look at the box of this Frostbit thing. &gt;https://cryoniks.com/#!/app/frostbit/ &gt; &gt;Now, we all have seen how large the heatsinks are for the 10 Ghash/s cards from asicminer, right? They are quite large, and even have fans to cool them. This machine apperntally does 100x the hash rate, so we can safely assume it gives off at least ten times the heat. To give off that heat fast enough so that the temperature does not rise to burning temperatures, you need to shift it to another medium, be it air, water, or even liquid nitrogen, faster than it is generated. On this box, we do not see any sort of radiators, heatinks, air holes, fans, or even seems for air to flow through. How on earth will they radiate heat quick enough?! &gt; &gt;They are for some reason using liquid nitrogen somehow to cool the chips, but then you have to think, hm, well, the heat does not just dissapear, as that would defy a good bit of laws regarding physics, and more specifically, violate conservation of energy, unless of course they are using a patent pending process of turning energy into raw matter as per E=MC^2! Don't forget, that the very act of circulating liquid nitrogen is an energy intensive process, so you are injecting more energy into the loop, causing even more heat. Not to mention, it takes a very sexy compressor to change Nitrogen from gas at 1 ATM to a high enough pressure to make it turn into liquid. Such a compressor is very large, very expensive, very heavy, and uses massive amounts of energy. &gt; &gt;&gt;Drawing Nitrogen gas directly from the environment, the FrostBit™ Cryonic System features nano-isolating **membranes specifically designed to reject other smaller atmospheric gases**. &gt; &gt;This does exist actually and is not that crazy. It is used in things like (very rarely) gas masks for example. Such technology is also used in specifically situations exactly like this, when you want to pump a gas out of another mixture of gasses so you can compress that gas for either storage or to liquefy it, often in academic settings. Howe ever, it is not called a ""Nano-isolating Membrane"", but I sadly forgot the name and a quick google does not give me anything. Hopefully someone else can chime in and say it. &gt; &gt;&gt;After assembly, each unit is injected with specially formulated acoustically and thermally insulating foam ensuring cool and quite operation.  &gt; &gt;Not sure why you want to make everything thermally insulated in there, especially such a compressor. Isn't the point of this LN2 magic to help get heat out of the unit anyways? Can't do that when everything is thermally insulated. &gt; &gt;&gt;Support loads for the internal structure are rated 30 times expected working load conditions protecting your investment from accidental damage due to improper working loads.  &gt; &gt;How big is this thing?! You don't need ""support loads"" engineering for something the size of three cubic feet at most while weighing less than a hundred pounds, unless you are making this out of paper mache, toothpicks, straws, and tissue paper. &gt; &gt;&gt;Additionally, the heavy-duty compressors are thermally and acoustically insulated to ensure smooth and quite operation year-round. &gt; &gt;Again, thermally insulating a compressor at such work loads is a very sad face no no. That heat will be injected into the cooling loop and therefore increasing the temperature of your chips. There is good reason why fridges and AC's have air holes or vent seems right where the compressor is, to cool it. &gt; &gt;&gt;We’ve taken ASIC processing to the next level with our patent pending ASIC+ Cryonic Architecture™ featuring select low-temperature superconducting materials. &gt; &gt;And how much do you figure it costs to set up a chip fab to use exoitc materials? A normal fab capable of 110 nm costs millions upon millions of dollars, using standard materials. And these people quietly built such a fab, all by themselves, out of nowhere? If it was indeed this easy, Intel and TSMC would have been using such technology for years by now. Not to mention needing the know-how of a good bit of PHD's in material sciences and physics. We are talking stuff that if were true, would be very ground breaking and have many applications for customers who are willing to pay a pretty penny, such as the DOD and space programs, yet we do not see anything like this yet, so it probably has yet to happen. &gt; &gt;&gt;We use custom-built condensers featuring environmentally inert **Helium** Compression Technology to rapidly cool and condense collected dry nitrogen gas into high-purity liquid nitrogen to directly cool our **processors**. &gt; &gt;What has Helium have to do with this? And how are they using it to rapidly cool and condense nitrogen? But here is a very key thing that shows just how little they understand what this mining business is, their use of the word processors. Never, not once, have the mining chips been called processors, anywhere, instead they are called asics, and for good reason. They are just brute forcing hashes, nothing more, nothing less. There is little to no processing involved. I personally feel that this is the dead giveaway. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Cryoballsacks, Inc. guarantees to meet and surpass U.S EPA, CPSC, and FCC Suggested Product Safety Guidelines on lead and mercury use as well as pre-screening our vendors for responsible resource procurement practices to ensure they meet our strict criteria for safe carbon emission standards &amp; sound** mineral** procurement policies. &gt; &gt;I am quite sure that you need to meet a no mercury or very low mercury regulation regardless, if you want to sell it in the USA. Also, what do minerals have to do with anything? There are no minerals involves in this, anywhere. &gt; &gt;&gt;During the first 24 hours, Nitrogen gas from the environment will be collected and stored within leaving a slightly Oxygen rich environment. NEVER run your FrostBit™ Cryonic Bitmining units running near an open flame. See the provided Safety &amp; Maintenance Guide for more information. &gt; &gt;If the nitrogen being sucked out of the air quickly part was true, then they are actually right here. Less nitrogen in the air, which currently takes up about 3/4 of all air (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth), which result in much more oxygen being in the area, which would result in a very dangerous situation. After all, this is how a few of the Apollo astronouts died during a test, they had an oxygen rich enviorment during testing, which resulted in a massive fire, burning them all to death or asphyxiating them. And too much oxygen as well as too little nitrogen can kill you, hence why divers always keep an eye on how much O2 and Nitrogen they have left. Too much of either one results in death. &gt; &gt;&gt;But keep in mind that the system must go through a liquid “purge” that might take up to 6 hours for the stored liquid Nitrogen to evaporate. &gt; &gt;Liquid nitrogen evaporates very quickly, but if we were to play devils advocate, they could be doing this to prevent nitrogen building in an area, therefore keeping the air breathable by someone nearby. But still, why do you have to get rid of the LN2 when moving it? What difference does it make if you are moving it or not for a closed LN2 cooling loop? Nothing.  &gt; &gt;&gt;CAN I USE MY FROSTBIT™ CRYONIC UNIT TO MINE FOR LITECOIN, PROCESS VIDEO, OR ANYTHING ELSE? &gt;&gt;Our team will continue to make it possible to upgrade your FrostBit™ 1000 Cryonic Bitmining unit to allow for additional unit capabilities &gt; &gt;So they have either made a godly chip which is very reconfigurable, allowing for using both massively different Scrypt and SHA-256 algorithms, without any physical changes, or they included ASIC implimentations of both algo's seperatly on the same asic, or lastly but most likely, they are just scamming you!  &gt; &gt;Well, this turned out much longer than expected. Ah well, hopefully I did my part in discouraging any possible purchasers from loosing their money on garbage like this, and keeping one scam less in the Bitcoin world, therefore helping keeping Bitcoins image as non scammy as possible.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ex432/the_asic_device_scams_are_getting_fancier_psa/ca4z5bw  Edit: Here is a response from Cryptos with my attempts at refuting some of their claims.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fjwyc/crypteks_kickstarter_scam_continues_to_be_ignored/cabl1fz",™
t5_2qwx3,whatdoyouwantmetosay,1370017904,"It was a dark day, I remember that most clearly.  I was standing in line at Dairy Queen when this gargantuan beast of a man nearly tore off the door as he barged his way in. He made his way to the front of the line, pushing aside a mother and her child and bumping an elderly man so hard his dentures catapulted from his mouth. I cleanly stepped aside, barely escaping the beastman's wide breadth.  ""One Turtle Waffle Bowl Sundae, with nuts,"" he said through clenched teeth to the greasy-faced youth behind the register. The youth shrunk at the man's command and walked back to the assembly area. Trembling, he created a sloppy rendition of a Turtle Waffle Bowl Sundae (with nuts) and gave it to the man.  ""That will be three sixty-five sir,"" feebly holding out his hand. The boy's small hand was crushed instantly as the brute brought his ham hock fist down upon it. He gave an animal's roar, grasped the boy's head, and forced it into the cash register, smattering it with blood. The boy was dead instantly.  We watched in horror as the man turned, his muscles bristling and his eyes crazed, and grabbed the businessman standing behind him in line.  ""Someone make a Turtle Waffle Bowl Sundae, with nuts, or this man gets it"" he said, holding the businessman hostage in a headlock. His voice, as large as his frame, reverberated through the building.  I couldn't believe it myself. I had only just picked up Dairy Queen Tycoon™ on the Amazon MAYhem sale last week. I had the high score, of course, but can my expertise translate to a real life experience? I told myself it did.  ""I can,"" I said. I maintained eye contact as best I could and walked behind the counter. I maintained eye contact throughout my creation of the Turtle Waffle Bowl Sundae, with nuts. I did not need to see it to know that yes, this will be my greatest creation yet.  I presented it to the hulking man, who dropped the businessman roughly on the ground, who then scurried away on all fours. The spoon in the man's hand looked comically small, like a Tyrannosaur with a toothpick. A hush fell over the crowd as he dug into the Turtle Waffle Bowl Sundae, with nuts. His eyes closed. He inhaled quickly. The moments turned to hours. My palms were sweating. This was the moment of truth. Did it work? Did I save everyone?  Little did he know, that I had infused into the ice cream my space-time dimensional dust which sent everyone in Dairy Queen hurtling through time. The large man grabbed me by my ankles as we were both lifted up, spinning through the tear in space we had created.  ""Which is how we got here, my liege,"" I said. The king's court was quiet.  ""A madman. Have him hanged,"" the king said.  Two men with halberds walked forward, summoning me to stand and leading me toward the gallows. If only I had my space-time dimensional dust, which was now in the possession of the man who had burst into Dairy Queen. Who was that man, I wondered.

t5_2t82m,blondechick80,1370020680,"I'm going to post this because it seems people are unsure of how to care to Pampered Chef Stones. This is for the pizza stone, the directions are the same for all the stones in the collections.  (source: I sell Pampered Chef, and these are the directions included with the items)    	 Use and Care   	 Tips   	 Safeguards  Large Round Stone with Handles      Use and Care [return to top] Hand wash only; wash prior to first use. Remove excess food with scraper. It is not recommended to use soap, detergent or an automatic dishwasher. Not dishwasher-safe.  Stoneware will naturally season and develop a natural nonstick surface over time with use.  Slight sticking may occur for the first several uses. For best results, bake high-fat foods (e.g., refrigerated biscuits) or lightly brush with cooking oil for the first several uses. Aerosol nonstick spray is not recommended; it will create a sticky residue which is difficult to clean. Stoneware can be used in conventional, convection and microwave ovens, and is freezer-safe. Stoneware is heat-resistant to 450°F (230°C). Do not use Stoneware under broiler or on direct heat source. Follow oven manufacturer's guidelines.  Three-year guarantee for noncommercial use. Refer to sales receipt for details. Tips [return to top] Prevent breakage from thermal shock by avoiding extreme temperature changes.  Do not preheat stone.  At least two-thirds of Stoneware surface should be covered with food to avoid thermal shock. Always evenly distribute food over Stoneware surface; avoid clustering foods.  Do not place dense, frozen food items (chicken breasts, pot pies, roasts or chops) on Stoneware. Always thaw dense, frozen food in refrigerator prior to baking.  Foods refrigerated in Stoneware may be placed directly in a preheated oven.  Do not place any other pan or rack on top of Stoneware while baking. Follow recipe temperature and baking time when using Stoneware. Short bake times (under 12 minutes) may need an additional 1-2 minutes  Safeguards   Hot Stoneware can cause burns if handled improperly. Always use a heat-resistant oven mitt or pad when handling hot Stoneware or placing on surfaces.  Stoneware may scratch surfaces. Protect surfaces by using a protective barrier between Stoneware and surface.  Avoid extreme temperature changes. Always allow Stoneware to cool to room temperature prior to adding liquid or cleaning. Do not use chipped or damaged Stoneware.  Stoneware can break if bumped or dropped. If this occurs, use caution as broken pieces can be sharp and could cause injury.  Stoneware should not touch the sides of the oven or oven door when closed.  © 2013 The Pampered Chef used under license. Made in USA #1371-09/09",©

t5_2r7yd,farmerje,1370025267,"I'm going to talk about two things.  The first is what (I think) is going on in your head when you're in this situation.  The second is a little bit about OOP in general that will hopefully give you a clearer picture of what it's all about.  First, if anything below sounds too abstract, here's a concrete example we use at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com) (I'm one of the co-founders): https://gist.github.com/jfarmer/9be684132e4e3ca18b00  This might be useful to keep open as you read this.  Second, don't get hung up on ""design patterns.""  There's a phrase I like: one language's design pattern is another language's syntax.  At the lowest levels of computerdom, for example, there's no such thing as a ""function,"" there's only a really long line of 0s and 1s which your computer interprets as data to shuffle around or code to be executed.  In assembly a function is a design pattern, in C it's syntax.  In C you don't have objects per se, but you can write code that adheres to the spirit of OOP.  In C OOP is a design pattern, in C++/Ruby/Java/etc. it's syntax.  To begin, understand that no rules are absolute.  The rules were invented by people just as smart as you.  They were invented for good reasons, but unless you know those reasons the rules will always feel arbitrary.  It's both a mistake to believe that the rules are absolute or that they're arbitrary.  They're just conditional and you don't know the conditions.  Yet.  There's two good strategies I see for learning these conditions.  First, you can go learn about the history of OOP.  Why did we even think this was a good way to do things to begin with?  How did we do things before?  What are some good examples of the same program implemented in an OOP-style and a non-OOP style?  What are the differences, both technical and practical?  OOP as a concept existed before the first ""OOP"" language, obviously.  How else would be think to design an OOP language?  How did we do the same things before languages that supported OOP concepts like objects, classes, etc. as first-order, syntactic constructs?  Second, assuming OOP was invented to address a real need, put yourself in a situation where you're feeling that same need.  This means shipping software that you know at an intellectual level ""breaks"" the OOP rules.  Assuming OOP is a sane way to design software, deliberately ship non-OOP software and make note of the annoyances you face.  Is your code easy to understand?  Could someone else dive in and follow what it was doing?  How easy is it to change?  What makes code easy to change or not?  What happens if a core assumption or requirement changes?  How resilient is your code in the face of those changing requirements?  etc. etc.  Now, let's have some Real Talk™ about OOP.  The principles you apply in web development shouldn't be any different than the principles you apply in game development or applet design or anything else.  So I'm a little worried that you've separated them conceptually.  The rules that make for good web apps are no different than the rules that make for good games &amp;mdash; it's only the conditions that are different.  Every piece of code you write is a reflection of some idea you have in your head.  That idea might be a certain process, a general concept, or anything really.  But you have some picture in your head and you want to put some or all of it down in code.  OOP is one strategy for organizing this process.  If you imagine your code as a kind of play and you the playwright, OOP says ""Start with the major actors and major set pieces.  Describe how they interact.  Bring in smaller actors, stage managers, etc. as necessary and describe their interactions with the rest of the play.""  As a strategy, procedural design is a more literal implementation of the play where you essentially start writing the script from top to bottom ""as it happens.""  It's more linear and, to a beginner, feels more natural.  That's not how a playwright thinks about a play, though.  They think in terms of characters, motivations, internal mental and emotional states, relationships between characters, how characters change over time, etc.  There's something about encapsulation in there, if you can see it.  Two characters in a play have their own internal emotional state.  It might change based on how other characters interact with them.  That emotional state isn't directly accessible to other characters; it's only accessible via well-defined ""interfaces.""  For characters (humans) that includes things like talking, body language, actions, etc.  So it's dangerous to think of OOP as a ""bag of tricks"" or a set of rules you're supposed to memorize.  It's more like a certain perspective on the design of software.  Hope that helps!",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1370037378,"I didn't renounce Christianity that very day, of course. I was far too entrenched for that. I figured that since Jesus had so far been a fairly positive influence in my life, I might as well try giving him the benefit of the doubt. After all, I had plenty of friends and family who were still perfectly content with a religion whose history, whose underlying dogma they knew next to nothing about.   What's the fundamental difference between a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity implicitly out of misunderstanding, and a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity *explicitly*, out of disgust? If I was going to pick and choose the good parts, I was at least going to be honest with myself about that fact. So, for a time, I was an increasingly syncretic ""spiritual"" ""Christian"". As I modified my worldview to reflect my changing understanding of philosophy and of how the universe operated, I found that the term applied to me less and less appropriate. When I found I was holding on to it merely as a cultural formality, I discarded it.  There was a lot more to it than just the dogma, of course. I had a Personal Relationship With God™. I felt what I identified as God's Presence in my mind. I had ""received visions"". In my moments of deepest prayer or meditation, I was sure I could actually hear a voice talking back to me. It was only as I learned more about psychology that I understood that there were other possible explanations for all of those phenomena, and it was years before I admitted that those other explanations just plain *made more sense*.  I tried out all sorts of different metacosmologies, from polytheism to panentheism to deism to pure solipsism. Perhaps, I thought, Yahweh was a Caananite war-god (just one of many extremely powerful beings) who had had a really lucky streak and ended up far more powerful by wiping out his peers. Perhaps Jesus was a philosopher (who may have been a magician, a demigod, or simply a charlatan) who was attempting to civilize Yahweh's followers by degrees, by explaining things to them in terms they could understand, even if that required some insincere toadying to the tyrant.  Or perhaps the One True God was ineffable, and could only be understood for how he interacted with our universe. While every religion was almost certainly wrong, might there not still be an Ultimate Intelligence who can be communicated with and who ought to be venerated?  Or perhaps *I* was God, and just hadn't figured it out yet.  Or perhaps all this speculation was pointless, since it offered absolutely nothing to my understanding of the world. Perhaps I should stop wasting my time trying out different wild unfalsifiable speculations, and focus all that extra energy on understanding our beautiful, complex, *natural* world.  ---- I've read The Bible a couple of times since, knowing it was mostly Bullshit but attempting to appreciate it as literature. If you do that expecting an all powerful or all-loving monotheistic god, it's not going to make *any* sense, and all sorts of plot holes are going to jump right out at you. Though the text has been revised and censored and redacted over and over again, there's still plenty of evidence that the writers of they oldest books were polytheists, who simply thought that Yahweh was *their personal god*. Yahweh would not put nearly so much effort into exterminating other gods if they were mere fictions. Either they must have been legitimate rivals, or Yahweh was absurdly jealous and paranoid to beyond a pathological level. (Of course, since the second is a given, I suppose it could have been both. But I digress).  [Historical evidence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg)  bears [this hypothesis out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfFx9JTQl8)- the Old Testament shows heavy signs of editing during the Deuteronomist revision, in which worship of other gods was made illegal. It shows signs of even heavier editing by Second Isaiah during the Babylonian exile, with the intention to remove reference to any other gods as potential rivals.   There's also the problem of the God Mode Mary Sue, a being with the powers to solve any problem perfectly and instantly with no effort, and a personality that suggests that they want to see those problems solved. Either they immediately snap their fingers and solve the plot in five seconds flat, in which case the story is over and you can put it down and go read something better, or they *don't* do so, in which case the story **makes absolutely no sense**.  Forget the strong form of the Problem of Evil for a moment, which asks why suffering exists at all. Ask yourself instead why an even remotely good being would **actively commit** all the evil that is attributed to Yahweh if he could at all avoid it. Ask yourself why he so often seems unaware of something or has to inspect things in person, or why he seems unable to accomplish something, like defeat an army with Chariots of Iron in Judges 1:19. When you consider the literary character Yahweh like you would Paul Atredies or Hari Seldon or David Xanatos or Corwin of Amber– an immensely intelligent and powerful (but still limited) being who is playing a very long, very high stakes game, everything suddenly makes a lot more sense. He's still an asshole, but at least he's not a completely schizophrenic asshole. And, more importantly, he suddenly *works* as a literary character.  It becomes the story of one god's struggle to set himself above his rivals, and to lead his chosen people to greatness. It shows that god struggling with his own blood lust, and with the fact that he is *quite* mad with power. A couple of times, you think he might have learned a lesson and mellowed out a little, but then he loses control and goes right back to smiting. It's really quite tragic. It shows his people who variously genuinely appreciate the help their patron is giving them, or simply suffer with an extremely advanced case of Stockholm Syndrome as they are repeatedly forced to sing about how great he is.  Once Yahweh *makes sense* as a character,  then the story begins to make sense as well. If not for the various revisions that, in trying to fellate their god into omnipotence and omnibenevolence, introduced innumerable jarring contradictions and plot holes, it may well have been a masterpiece on the same order as the Iliad or the Bhaghavad Gita. And sometimes, I enjoy watching the twisted tale of this psychopath the same way I enjoy watching Hannibal Lector in *Red Dragon* or *The Silence of the Lambs*.  Is it *the Greatest* work of literature ever? Not even close. *The Lord of the Rings* to name one book, surpasses it poetically, morally, mythically, and even in the consistency of its world building. But one cannot ignore the tremendous influence it has had on subsequent literature. If I were to bring Isaac Newton forward in time, he would know less about physics than pretty much any PhD physicist on the planet, but that fact would not diminish his unsurpassed contributions to the field. (That's not a perfect analogy- Newton was a mad genius, while most of the authors of the Bible were just *mad*- but it's close enough for my purposes).  The Good Book is not, in any sense of the term,  *a good book*. But it's a book that I believe just about everyone- christian and heathen alike- can benefit from reading.",™
