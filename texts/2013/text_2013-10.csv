t5_2qh1o,Schnoofles,1380586532,"They work, but you need to have realistic expectations for it. They make a lot less noise than a traditional vacuum, but they also take quite a bit longer to do the job. They won't be *as* good as you are at vacuuming, but they generally get the job done. They also don't play well with persian rug-style carpets because of the amount of friction they have to fight against. Also, they can get tangled up in loose wires if you have those on the floor and you'll want to have your room be relatively open and without too many small nooks and crannies for it to get lost in.   If the above isn't an issue for you, such as if you have hardwood/linoleum/vinyl etc floors, relatively large rooms and not too much clutter on ground level then it's a very nice thing to have around. Although it takes longer than you would to do its job and you still need clean it out every now and then the main benefit is that of convenience. You just set it on a schedule (for the models with such a feature) or start it when you're heading out or don't mind it nibbling at your toes and then go about your business. Again, it's not as good as a human and it doesn't have near the suction of a traditional vacuum, but it's good enough™ for most things and imo that makes it worth it. Plus, it's really really cool, so it gets bonus points for that.",™

t5_2qioo,Lance_BabyArmApple,1380589633,"&gt; Touch less Wi-Fi® Security makes connecting to secure networks simple and wild.  Whaaa?  Anyway, I'm no tech, but it looks like this is a wireless USB unit that would replace the card that (I'm assuming) is installed in the computer that was dropped.  If I were you I would a) if you are set on trying this product, make sure that you are buying it from a retailer that has an easy return policy (no restocking fee, etc). If it doesn't work, you won't be out the $.  b) have your laptop fixed which would mean, opening the case and having the internal wireless card replaced (IF THAT IS IN FACT THE PROBLEM!) and have a look around for any other damage that may have been done. Otherwise you might be looking at other issues in the future.  Are you comfortable opening your laptop? Have any friends or family that might be able to aid you? There are TONS of how tos on YouTube and the web alike if you are thinking about giving a go. Just take it slow and gentle :)  If you're in a bind, you could also take your computer to the dork squad or something similar to have them take a look at it / test it. Be warned though, that a lot of places like that will charge you an arm and a leg!  Again, all this is if the wireless card IS IN FACT the issue! Hope that this will at least give you some food for thought. Sorry about the ramble. Good luck!  EDIT: an the? That don't make no sense!",®

t5_2qh1i,Varvars,1380612303,"Only the most gruesome, seductive and beautiful love/ hate story there is!   McCormick delivers an uneven performance in her reading of Cain's bestselling debut thriller. Gretchen Lowell, The Beauty Killer, was one of the most prolific serial killers in history, claiming over 200 lives. Her only surviving victim was Archie Sheridan, the lead detective on the task force set up to apprehend her. Archie was tortured for days until Lowell inexplicably turned herself in. Two years later Archie is still a victim, on leave from the force, estranged from his family, addicted to pain pills and obsessively visiting Gretchen weekly. When a new killer begins murdering teenage girls, Archie is called back into action. By his side is an ambitious, pink-haired news reporter who may become her own page-one headline. The usually reliable McCormick has a rocky start with the first few chapters. Her clipped, overarticulation of each line keeps listeners at a distance instead of immersing them in the mesmerizing events taking place. However, she does improve as the story moves forward, and her rich, throaty portrayal of Gretchen Lowell is the perfect blend of predator and seductress.

As such, you can apply it to almost any element and it just works™.  It also gives the user some power so far as offsets and at what scroll position to ""stick"" the element along with speed and easing.  The code is also really lightweight .9kb so that's nice.  The only thing I'm not 100% pleased with is I haven't added the option to contain it to a parent element yet.

Many of us game dev types start off with that feeling: like we can make our Grand Vision™ happen on the first serious project we undertake.  I'll help you come down softly:  your project is certainly doable.  But it won't be your first project.  Or even your second one.  It probably won't happen for several years, even.  The Kickstarter won't be successful until you have a LOT of content to show potential investors.  And an MMO is about as big as a project gets.  The reality is that you will not be making your MMO for quite some time.  If you have any marketable skills (programming, art, music), then you might get on someone else's team to help make *their* MMO and get some experience.  But it's unlikely that you will put a reliable team together with ""little knowledge"" and a big dream.  The bottom line is that you have to build yourself up to it.  You can make it, but you have to wait until you are ready to make it.  A willing spirit is not enough.  I highly recommend you go read the articles that this guy wrote on game design: http://www.sloperama.com/advice.html  He's entertaining to read and tells it to you straight without insults or pandering.  I'm not trying to be mean.  It's just been a day and nobody's been up front with you yet.  Start small.  Make some (simpler) games to get experience.  Build a reputation.  Then you can build the team.  It'll be a long time, but if you don't give up, you can realize that Grand Vision™ someday.  I wish you the best of luck.",™

t5_2qknd,Mary_Victoria,1380662503,"Hi Elquesogrande, good to be here.  The state of publishing? My answer would be, ‘in flux’ - sorry if that’s old news. But I also suspect business models will settle down one way or another, eventually. They tend to.   The real question at least for me is: will readers still be offered a rich variety of books, books which entertain, inform, challenge, under the new model? And who will pay for them? We might enter another era of gentleman writers-of-leisure being the only ones who can afford to publish, because author returns are simply too low. Eeek.  I wish I knew why books were deemed suitable to one market and not to another. I wish I could give you more answers… I don’t have them myself! In my own small experience, the Tree books were published ‘downunder’ because that’s where I was. I’ve since moved to the UK but those books remain… rooted in the antipodes. ☺  More about my writing style… let’s see. It has evolved. The way I write now is quite different from the way I wrote on the Chronicles of the Tree. That’s neither here nor there, of course: the writing style on COT suited COT, the writing style on the current ms suits the current ms… The Tree books were my stab at what’s generally called ‘high fantasy’. That is, you’ll find several well-known tropes in play – a young protagonist coming of age, mentors, love interests, secret magic and, yes, prophecies. There’s a reason these things exist in stories. If you read through to the second and third books, you’ll find out where I’ve selectively turned those tropes on their heads or else followed them through to a logical end.   I hope that makes a teeny bit of sense. ",☺

t5_2qzb6,Bardfinn,1380664693,"Computer scientist here;  While I do not know the name redacted in that report, the ""VPN and Web encryption devices"" mentioned are most likely [hardware SSL acceleration appliances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_acceleration), and due to the sensitive nature of the backdoor being discussed, are probably in chips fabricated by a US-based silicon designer using a US-located silicon fabrication plant.  The reason for that is twofold; first, you don't want a foreign power discovering your backdoor in a chip, and second, you don't want a foreign power inserting their own backdoor.  The [vendors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_acceleration#Vendors) list in Wikipedia lists the following vendors of SSL appliances:  * Barracuda Networks * Array Networks * CAI Networks * Cavium Networks (fabless semiconductor designer) * Cisco Systems * Citrix Systems * Cotendo * Coyote point systems * Crescendo Networks * Exinda * F5 Networks * Foundry Networks * Forum Systems * Freescale Semiconductor (fabless and fab-owning) * Hifn * IBM (fab-owning) * Interface Masters Technologies * jetNEXUS * Juniper Networks * Nortel Networks * Radware * Riverbed Technology * Strangeloop Networks * Sun Microsystems  Of those, the two names that stand out most are IBM (which is no stranger to crippling encryption upon the demands of the NSA, with fabrication plants throughout the world and the United States, but which isn't significantly given to florid chip descriptors) and Freescale Semiconductors - it is itself a large semiconductor fabricator, focused on semiconductor fabrication, with foundries in Chandler, AZ and Oak Hill, TX.  One not mentioned in that list is Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer that is *fabless*, that is - it doesn't own any fabrication capability, itself. It does, however, design a very large percentage of communications chips used in the industry. Not finding a Broadcom chip somewhere in a device is notable.  The redacted space is roughly twelve all-caps letters or sixteen mixed-case letters in that font. If we could have someone identify exactly which font was used, then we could experiment with chip names from SSL acceleration device manifests, in that font, and see which fit into the redacted space, possibly with the manufacturer's name in front of the chip - for example, the [Freescale SAHARA](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=NETWORK_SECURITY_CRYPTOG) appears to fit nicely - and is touted as having configurable access control to the random number generator and hashing functions on that feature sheet linked - but is just one possibility. Another is the [PowerArchitecture™ from Mocana -formerly FreeScale](https://mocana.com/partnerprog/freescale/selling_freescale_sca.pdf) .  If I were in the position to lead a project to reverse-engineer the possible name of the chip, I would:  * Find out what the top five top-selling SSL acceleration device manufacturers in the world are; * get a list of their best-selling products; * Get parts manifests for each of their popular products, possibly from an electronics tear down research organisation; * Locate and name the crypto accelerator chips; * Determine who designed and fabricated those chips. * Get the name of the font used in the report in the imgur link; * Compose the name of each of those chips in that font at that pitch; * Do a little comparing.  *Edit*: OP is assuming that the report is listing *two, separate* chips. While that is *possible*, it is equally as likely that one variety or species of chip is being named! i.e. *Intel Pentium chips*. There is also no guarantee that the redacted text lists a florid, marketing-friendly name, and may possibly be a code name internal to the US intelligence community. These and other alternatives should not be discounted.",™

t5_2rd6n,drone13,1380671595,"The denizens of planet Arth are either extremely wealthy or extremely poor with nearly no middle class. As can be expected, each class look for different things in their pets.   The poor keep helpful pets such as ""mutts"" which are the result of thousands of years of hobbyist genetic engineering and genetic pollution. Domestic mutts have literally no features in common with one another other than their lack of intelligence, Earth origin, and tameness. They can have fur coats, lobster like carapaces, (non-functinal) insect wings, tentacles, extra legs, you name it. They are mostly used as guard dogs or pack mules by wastelanders. Unfortunately sometimes they are forced to fight each other as a popular spectator sport.  The rich on the other hand prefer pets that are cute or pleasing and as a result, fragile and likely unable to survive longer than thirty seconds outside the arcology's walls. Unlike the dirty wastelanders, the wealthy engineer their pets carefully and maintain detailed taxonomies. Most pets are simply creative splices between two or more ""old world"" species such as the otterdog or ever popular bunnycat which is the official mascot of several sports teams (go Prefecture 8 bunnycats!). High end pets have their entire genomes written from scratch by professional genetic designers such as the Flufficus™ and the LilGuy™. The wealthiest of the wealthy can even hire a genetic designer to create a customized pet with any feature they could possibly want however it is generally accepted among the public that these types of pets rarely end up well due to the client's poor aesthetic sense, an example being the hideous neck-less leopard print quadruped with the client's name across the back in pink fur.",™

t5_mouw,moarag,1380677646,"Considering this would be 1 lb of a.i. per year on 2,000,000 lbs of soil (furrow slice), it is not all that much. I can think of other herbicides that are used at the same or higher rate than glyphosate, i.e. glufosinate, paraquat, monosodium methanearsenate (MSMA). I can also name many more that are much worse for the environment (2 of the above mentioned).  On the note of land absorbing glyphosate;  &gt; Soil: In general, glyphosate is moderately persistent in soil. The primary reason crops can be planted or seeded directly into treated areas following application is that glyphosate exhibits essentially no preemergent activity even when applied at high rates (Franz et al. 1997). Soil studies have determined glyphosate half-lives ranging from 3 to 130 days (U.S. EPA, 1990; USDA, 1984). The soil field dissipation half-life averaged 44-60 days (Kollman and Segawa, 1995; WSSA, 1989).  In the soil environment, glyphosate is resistant to chemical degradation, is stable to sunlight, is relatively nonleachable, and has a low tendency to runoff (except as adsorbed to colloidal matter). It is relatively immobile in most soil environments as a result of its strong adsorption to soil particles. Ghassemi et al. (1981) found that less than one percent of the glyphosate in the soil is absorbed via the roots. The Accord® label stated that, it is not available for plant uptake and will not harm off-site vegetation where roots grow onto the treatment area or if the soil is transported off-site (Accord® label). Sprankle et al. (1975) found that the prime factor in determining the amount of glyphosate adsorbed to soil particles is the soil phosphate level and that glyphosate is bound to soil through the phosphonic acid moiety. Glyphosate competes with inorganic phosphate for soil binding sites and the degree of binding depends on availability of unoccupied phosphate binding sites. Glyphosate’s primary route of decomposition in the environment is through microbial degradation in soil (Franz et al. 1997). The herbicide is inactivated and biodegraded by soil microbes at rates of degradation related to microbial activity in the soil and factors that affect this activity (Eriksson, 1975). The biological degradation process is carried out under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by soil microflora. Rates of decomposition depend on soil and microfloral population types. In nonsterile conditions, as much as 55 percent of 14C-labeled glyphosate is given off as 14CO2  within 4 weeks using Lintonia Sandy Loam soil (USDA, 1984; Rueppel et al., 1977).  The primary metabolite of glyphosate is aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA).  Degradation of AMPA is generally slower than that of glyphosate possibly because AMPA may adsorb onto soil particles more strongly than glyphosate and/or because it may be less likely to permeate the cell walls or membranes of soil microorganisms (USDA, 1984). A study on the effects of glyphosate on microbial biomass (Stratton G. and Stewart K. 1992) found glyphosate generally had no significant effect on the numbers of bacteria, fungi or actinomycetes in forest soil and overlying forest litter. There was no effect of glyphosate on in situ respiration in most of the treated systems while the remainder showed a increase in respiration. Muller et al. (1981) found that glyphosate degrades at very low temperatures and does not adversely affect nitrogen fixation, nitrification or denitrification activity.

Did you miss the part where it was passed by all aspects of the government set for checks and balances?  * Legislative branch: both houses ✔ * Judicial branch: Supreme Court ✔ * Executive branch: Signed in by the president ✔  &gt; funding the Federal government is the task of US Congress  It is *a* task of the Congress. Not the sole one. Regardless, you can not use it as a tool for fighting a law. Democrats don't use government shut downs as a threat for not implementing immigration reform and background checks. Shutting down the government in retaliation to not getting the law you want is wholly irresponsible. Leaving government workers to be furloughed, and leaving key services in stalemate should be used as a tool against a law that has already been passed? A system of checks and balances ensures such upholding of laws, allowing for debate, voting, signing in, and ultimately constitutional approval. Shutting down the government is not part of these checks and balances.",✔

t5_2sokd,cytael,1380681001,"As one who sits firmly on the ""right"" end of the political spectrum, there are several problems with Obamacare.  First off is the part that requires insurance companies to provide coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. While that sounds great from an altruistic standpoint, it's simply mathematically unfeasible. Requiring companies provide insurance for people who are, at large, uninsurable, is just a bad plan. The only way to sustain that is to significantly raise insurance premiums for everyone, across the board, and those increases will be beyond significant. I've heard anecdotal reports of some fringe cases where people of above-average health have seen their out-of-pocket coverage expenses increase on the order of ~500%.  Tied to the pre-existing conditions requirement is the so-called Individual Mandate, which is a requirement that every American either purchase some form of health insurance or pay a yearly penalty. In the ACA's current state, this is pretty much a requirement to keep people from ""gaming the system"" and only purchasing health insurance when they have an actual malady, then dropping it right after. However, this amounts to the government forcing individuals to buy something, which very much doesn't sit well with the free-market-championing conservatives who believe that people should be allowed to choose how to spend their own money.  The ACA will also force companies to provide (costly) health insurance for their employees assuming the company has 50 or more full-time (30+ hours / week) employees. In response to this, many small businesses (which make up something like 85% of all companies in the US) are being forced to either cut back on workers' hours or lay people off entirely (to get under the 50 full time threshold), because the insurance options available simply aren't affordable to many of these smaller companies that were just barely turning a profit in the first place. Because of this, Obamacare is seen to be actually hurting the overall economy. In the name of helping the lowest of the low, large percentages of the lower-middle to middle class (read: the predominant labor force for such businesses as are most greatly affected by this) are (or will be) suffering pretty substantively.  The particularly cynical among conservatives would suggest that this is an intentional strategy by the Democrats: the plurality of citizens who vote democratic tend to be of lower economic standing, and much of the party's platform is intentionally crafted to appeal to that demographic (government-provided health insurance, cell phones, college loans, etc). In other words, by hurting the overall economic condition of particularly the middle-class, Democrats are gaining more votes for themselves in the future. While that's surely a smart play, politically speaking, it's a bit of a ""dick move,"" if you'll pardon the expression.  So **TL;DR**: Obamacare uses the facade of helping the lowest echelons of society in order to cause damage to everyone and ultimately increase the power and invasiveness of the federal government (which, in the opinions of most Republicans/conservatives, is a Bad Thing™).",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1380686881,"it's time for **RageChat™**  i've been pretty down on the music defener genre as of recent; RageArtists™ have been content to phone it in and have been reluctant to truly advance in the genre in any meaningful ways, leading to stale, repetitive comics that do little to inspire. this seems to be a riff on the Trevor comic [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/f7u12_ham/comments/1mzv90/le_and_he_got_molested_because_of_how_he_acted/), a comic that didn't impress me the first time around.  now i'm not sure if this is the same RageArtist™ or not, but it looks as though some of my criticisms have been addressed here. this isn't a ""breath of fresh air"" in the traditional sense; the same tropes are brought in, they've just been turned up around 4 notches. the innovation then is not in the content but the execution; OP's victory is *so comprehensive* and Trevor's defeat is *so crushing* that the whole thing becomes a parody of a parody. one of the big flaws in music defener comics of recent has been that while they're all fabrications (don't let the True Story™ face fool you), the artists never seem to be committed enough to this fact that they really drive it home. instead they're caught in some murky gray area between parody &amp; credibility that makes the whole endeavour feel a bit pointless. this comic sits firmly in the camp of the former, and is that much better for it.  this doesn't break the envelope, it just pushes it. and honestly, music defener comics have needed a push for some time. this could be a real shot in the arm for the genre.  **RageScore™**: 76",™

And there's a lot of butterfly-effect speculation one could make that if Albert had stayed put, he might well have remained fairly injury-free, and you'd have won the NLC by another 4-5 games or so, rather than having the Reds and Pirates nipping at your heels the whole way, with another series against the Buccos looming.....and you haven't exactly been their master this year, have you?

t5_2t9x3,SilentNumberXIII,1380711728,"I could give you some insight.  **Vi:**  **Pros**  - High mobility and damage from Q  - Almost quaranteed kills after you get your ultimate  - Good dive potential  - Can be paired with assassin mid to delete people in teamfights/for easy ganks  - Can deal tons of damage™ with relatively low items  **Cons**  - Falls behind easily  - Can put herself into bad spots with ultimate  - Relatively high manacosts(Spamming while farming will make you go oom)  - Ganks are not so good before lvl 6 if you cant get behind the enemy/use flash to Q them.  **Hecarim:**  **Pros**  - High snowball potential  - High dive potential  - High damage output   - If you get ahead in levels you will become unkillable monster  - Synergies well with the Triforce change/New SV  **Cons**  - He was nerfed hard  - His items were nerfed hard  - Pretty bad ganks pre 6  - You need farm or kills to be able to carry(Items he uses are expensive)  For the picking of jungler, you should go with a simple mindset.  Do we have damage? If yes go tanky jungle like J4 to help your lanes get ahead. If not you can go Noc and just farm and go damage items to carry. Also Jarvan is one of the most versatile junglers, you can go damage, tank, auras or anything between and still be effective.  Usually in soloQ your objective as jungler is to get your carries fed, and control the map. Push for objectives, camp the weak lane and get your enemies to rage at each other. For the dragon calls just ping like crazy and call it in the chat, also take timer and be ready to take it as soon as it spawns.   If you cant get your team to take dragon at desired time you can use it to counterjungle, gank, push their lane or just buy yourself.  Nasus is really strong farming/objective jungler, when you play him you can just clear whole jungle few times and back to buy spirit stone, boots and pink ward. Then just solo dragon at 6. Also Nasus counters many of the popular picks atm(i.e. Irelia, Jax, Aatrox, Vayne, Caitlyn...). You will have hard time ganking not overextended lanes thought, you have just one slow and possibly redbuff to cc them.

t5_2sxpk,jmsolerm,1380716129,"&gt; I've currently spent about 10 hours on the game and gotten to Mom twice.  That came out wrong.  &gt; Just wondering, what are your tactics at beating this lady?  Luckily, Mom is (usually) very predictable. You have three varieties, but since you haven't unlocked ""Everything's terrible"" you may only have seen one:  * Normal Mom: Spawns vanilla enemies from Basement and Caves, has a moderate amount of HP.  * Blue Mom: Spawns WotL enemies from Cellar and Catacombs. Has much less HP.  Those two have a very easy exploit: stay *next* to (below) the left door, very close, not in front of it. Mom will not stomp, and the hand can't hurt you there.  Shoot at the flesh/eye/hand and move only to kill enemies in your area.  Only gapers (""basic"" enemies), globins (red ooze guys), stray chargers (running maggots) and maws (floating heads) are worth moving for. For blue mom, you should only care about enemies coming too close, none will be especially good at tracking you.  * Red Mom: No spawns, stomps faster, eye shoots 3 blood drops. Higher HP  This one's not as exploitable. You'll have to rely on dodging and good reflexes.  &gt; Also, I try to check every room before trying to do the boss. Should I do this or should I skip everything and straight up fight the boss?  It depends. If you already have a powerful setup it may pay off to go straight for the boss, especially if you're on Necropolis. But generally you want to check out all the item rooms.  Finally, an additional tip: since you're kinda new, I guess you don't get many deals with the Devil. You can increase your chance of getting devil items in some ways:  * Red chests can contain trash (spiders, live bombs), pills, devil room teleports and devil items. They are found in Curse Rooms (marked with a red star and crescent ☪), go to them whenever possible.  * Devil rooms depend on many factors. Blow up beggars (regular or demon, preferably regular). Pentagrams add an additional chance. Don't take red damage in the boss fight: save all of your soul hearts for just before.  Devil items will increase your stats (pact, mark) or give you new skills (Brimstone, Spirit of the Night). If you get Guppy's paw, turn all your red heart containers to blue just before the final fight.",☪

Instead, it said there would be a reduction in the amount of labor supplied by workers — many of whom would decide to retire earlier than they normally would, or work fewer hours or fewer jobs, because of the subsidies provided by the law, and greater security for those buying their own coverage outside the workplace.

t5_2sqwc,scruffyhealer,1380733761,"**Leveling Up**  A common piece of feedback we heard during beta was that leveling up was, to be frank, boring. You dinged, there was a cool little animation that played, but then what? Is it worth making the trek back to town to purchase new abilities from the ability vendor? Did I unlock a new dungeon? What did I just earn for reaching a new Path level?  The game now answers all of these questions for you through the new Level Up interface. When you level, you'll be able to click to pop open a window, showing you all the new class benefits, game features, and so on that you've unlocked with your new level.  By making what you've unlocked much clearer, leveling up feels much more like a celebration, and less like a paralyzing choice of what to do or where to go next.  **Ability Loadouts**  Gaining new abilities as you level feels great, but it can also be overwhelming when you're not sure what situations the abilities are appropriate for, or which one is more suited for tanking or for DPS.  Enter, the new Ability Loadout UI.  Abilities are now sorted at the top by Assault (i.e. DPS), Support (i.e. Tank or Heals), Utility, and Path, making it much clearer which abilities fit into which spec. This allows players to build their Action Set with the abilities they want much faster. We've added sorting of the abilities you've unlocked vs. ones you will eventually be able to purchase, and also made it simpler to add/remove abilities from your loadout quickly.  **New Quest System**  This is the big one that's been taking up the majority of our Content Systems team's time over the last few months. As mentioned in the last State of the Beta update, we agreed that our quest system needed some work to make it feel more like a modern MMO. Happily, our first major revision of the quest system has been completed!  Quest objectives are no longer listed as ""Kill 6 Squirgs."" Instead, you gain progress across a bar the more creatures you kill. I can already hear most of you saying ""So what? Big deal! You just changed it visually so that you could mess with our minds, this doesn't actually change the fundamentals of questing."" Well, sure, I guess the cynics could look at it that way, but the true benefit becomes clear once we add in two extra features:  Creatures of varying difficulty can now count for more or less quest credit rather than every creature incrementing your kill count by one. Kill a Squirg? Maybe you earn 16% towards your quest objective. Take on a MEGASQUIRG DESTROYER™? Suddenly you've completed 40% of your quest with one badass kill.  Open tagging is now in the game. See a dude or dudette having trouble with a critter? Run over to help them take it down, and you'll both gain XP, quest credit, and loot for it. Even if you're not grouped with them!  These combined improvements to questing are definitely one of the largest changes we're  most excited about, but it's also one that requires the most extensive internal testing.  The specifics of Open Tagging are crazy complex and we could spend an entire devblog talking about the system behind it. For now, rest assured that we've kept in mind the usual concerns about open tagging when implementing this system, including powerleveling concerns, high-level gank squads, and the oft-used ""tag-and-forget"" scenarios that terribad players use.  We're also putting tons of polish and love into all four of our classes right now because we want to start diving deeper into them in a very public way in the near future. Wait, did I say four? It's six, I meant six.  That's about it from us; it's time we head back to our desks to keep working towards the next phase of beta. See you next week!  http://imgur.com/a/dn7ry ",™

t5_2qh1f,justplainmean,1380746651,"There is greater data usage, but the infrastructure to support that usage is better and cheaper. LTE is in a lot of cases cheaper than 3G. Plus the amount of data used is not really the expensive bit, its the amount of people trying to access that data at the same time. This isn't a factor at 2 am, but at peak times it gets to be too much. Capping Data or ending unlimited plans doesn't alleviate the congestion problem, it just maximizes the amount of money that can be extracted from your customers for the same service.  My point is that carriers are not really providing better services with their increase in prices. Whenever speed increase they are ultimately gimped by data caps. Its great that I can download a entire movie in 10 seconds, but not if that one movie is going to take up all my allotted data plus some overages. They implement the technology in a way so that you aren't actually getting anything more, but you still pay more. This is exactly the scenario that cable companies will probably do. You will be charged more for the level of services you currently buy, it will just be wrapped up in a bunch or marketing speak ""4G LTE UltraHD™ with DataConnect™ Technicolor™ onDemand"" and a bunch of nonsense reasoning on how people who actually watch TV are overloading their lines so that they need to start charging on how many hours of content you watch or some such nonsense.",™

t5_2szyo,AvenueMan,1380754173,"Doesn't really answer the question, but still pretty interesting:  The Popsicle® ice pop was accidentally invented in 1905 by 11-year-old Frank Epperson. Epperson left a mixture of powdered soda and water and a stirring stick in a cup on his porch. That night San Francisco experienced record low temperatures, and Epperson awoke the next morning to find a frozen pop that would eventually become a favorite American treat.   Epperson originally named his creation the ""Epsicle,"" and it quickly became popular with his school friends. It wasn't until 1923, however, while running a lemonade stand at an amusement park in Oakland, Cal., that he realized the commercial possibilities of his invention. Epperson changed the name of his treat to ""Popsicle,"" after his children’s frequent requests for ""Pop’s ’sicle,"" and applied for a patent. The patent for frozen ice on a stick was issued August 19, 1924. Around 1925, Epperson sold the rights to the brand name Popsicle® to the Joe Lowe Company in New York. By 1928, Epperson had earned royalties on more than 60 million Popsicle® ice pops  http://www.icecreamusa.com/popsicle/history/",®

The fact that *WEED IS EVIL* and *YOU WILL GO TO JAIL AND THE CHARGES WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE* has more to do with anxiety issues than the plant's chemical makeup.  Not to go all hippy-dippy, but if the social stigma were different I don't think many people would have crazy panic attacks.

t5_2t5iz,Boojamon,1380755952,"DISCLAIMER: I didn't know my body contained this much bile - but please, be my guest and wade into it. I'm currently enjoying Pokemon Black and do not believe that everyone who goes to PAX is a mouthbreathing social outcast. I mean, someone has to be serving the food, right? This is based on a personal experience.      A twelve-year-old boy sits quietly enjoying his game in the      backwaters of PAX. With his back propped against a cardboard      cutout of a  less-busty 2012 Lara Croft, he smirks with satisfaction      as his Charmander defeats Brock's Geodude - an accomplishment      that will stay with him for a lifetime.      A group of becostumed pokefans from nearby are huddled around a      'Mountain Dew®' stand, enjoying a refreshing cup of the sickly      vibrant syrup, intermittently spitting or drooling the beverage over      one of the booth girls who is far too young to be dressed in      whatever character costume the organisers have her flaunting - yet      far too scarred to be negatively affected by the nervous, yet      enthusiastic, attention.      One of the aforementioned fanboys look over at the boy - his sweat      stained Misty costume dank from the hours of queues and shaky      social interaction. ""Hey boys, we have a new one!"" he says, a little      too loudly, clapping someone he doesn't know on the back. Ignorant      to the scowls of the group, Misty (for that is how he prefers to be      called, or 'Derrek' when he's in his furry costume) walks over to the      boy and crouches by his side.      Licking the 'Mountain Dew®' from his braces, he leans in close      enough to look into the screen of the lime green Gameboy. ""First      gen, huh? You must be a true gamer! Are you gunna get X&amp;Y?""      ""Huh?"" replies the boy, as he looks around for his brother. His      brother is in his late teens, and is currently deeply engrossed in the      eighteenth Assassin's creed remake - a game which is entirely      different to the last in that it takes place in a dusty city where you      assassinate people by climbing buildings and then falling on them.      ""Oh man!"" says Misty, the saliva broiling at his teeth, ""You've not      seen it? Oh, you're gonna love it."" He paws at the air in a feeble      gesture as he reaches out for CTRL+T so that he can search for      blurry preview pictures via Google, only finding it's not there and      he's actually outside for once.      ""There are over six hundred pokemon in the new one (though      judging from previous games, you can probably only catch 200 of      them in the version you get), and the Pokemon can double-evolve      with a new form called a MEGA form. Your Charmander will      eventually evolve into a Charizard, which gets its own mega form! It      takes all the cool things from Digimon and just crams it straight into      the game without having to worry about things like consistency or      balance!"" Misty seethes, the energy pushing the pus of his pores to      the surface of his face.      ""And what's more, you can do it all in 3D - and if you don't like the      3D, you can buy a 2DS instead - which is fine for us high-flying      fans, huh?""      ""But - what about Geodude? Can I catch a Geodude?""      The boy's Gameboy continues to weakly tinkle out the      congratulations theme as the greyscale Brock pays out a couple      of hundred dollars for losing. It patiently awaits the press of an A      or B button.      ""Huh? Yeah, I guess. But what about the cool new *original*      Pokemon? Since the designers found out how to make bipedal,      humanoid Pokemon, the game has just got better and better! You      don't need to worry about old favourites, all the new ones are here      now! You're not a... a disgusting gen wunner, do you?"" The     words spat from his mouth - much like all the other words before it,      but this time with a fair ladle of malice. Sam didn't know what a gen      wunner was, but he sure as hell didn't want to be one.      ""N..no!"" He looked around for his brother again. The queue for the     new Assassin's Creed had changed from two to twelve in the period     he had been accosted by Misty, and his brother was starting to feel     the eyes of people waiting. That's when he turned away from the     screen to look at Sam being accosted by a man in his late teens     in a yellow vest and tiny denim shorts.      Misty noticed the brief interaction, and beads of perspiration began      to pearl on his greasy forehead, unable to make a purchase in the      clogged pores. A voice announced over the tannoy that the 'furry      romp' will begin in twenty minutes. With a sudden sense of duty,      Misty leaped to his feet. ""I've got to go,"" and began to stride off -      before turning around and adding, ""Smell you later.""  **TL;DR if you are from /r/Pokemon, I am so, so sorry. If you happen to be, or know Misty, I'm not even sorry. If this looks long it's because of the format, not because I sat at my computer for thirty minutes in a rant. I swear it.**",®

t5_2u7h3,New_Theocracy,1380774110,"&gt;The mistake you are making is you cannot differentiate between ""I believe"" and ""I know"". I cannot know for certain if the flying spaghetti monster exists, but I do not believe he does.  Then you aren't justified in believing that he doesn't exist. It isn't hard. If you don't know that he doesn't exist and you say he doesn't, then you are contradicting yourself.   &gt;his is how atheism and agnosticism can interact.   Prove that from the definitions. Belief and knowledge are intertwined in both definitions, so distinguishing between belief and knowledge is completely irrelevant to the discussion.  &gt;This comes down again to the arrogance of the gnostic position on the question. I believe, therefore it is fact.  That isn't the gnostic position. The gnostic position is ""I believe, because I have true justification"". I already asked you for atheistic philosophers who acknowledge the existence of agnostic atheism. You didn't give me one. Atheistic philosophers actually believe God does not exist, and they provide arguments for why they can make that definite statement.  &gt;I do not need to refute the ""answers"". The bible does it by itself  How? The contradictions you raised were refuted by engaging in simple critical analysis and exegesis.   &gt;Adding speculative circumstances to downplay the contradictions simply doesn't cut it. Good effort thought.  Ie: You are wrong and I don't have to prove it.  &gt;When he says something came from nothing, he is not simply taking about virtual particles. His model includes the universe total energy and outlying geometry which would allow it to come from nothing. Then again, why am I explaining this to you? You already know everything.  I know we are talking beyond virtual particles. His lecture is on youtube for goodness sake (not to mention you can get the pdf of his book online). I am pointing out specific areas where the reason falls apart.  &gt;His model includes the universe total energy and outlying geometry which would allow it to come from nothing.   Even if we allow that to make sense for two seconds, it still falls apart. Something can not come from nothing (actual nothingness, not the quantum vacuum), that is literally impossible.  To repost the argument:   &gt;This is a philosophical argument that utilizes scientific data in to support the second premise. I already posted justification for premise 1 as to why something that comes into being requires a cause. I will post it here for you. &gt; &gt;Justifications for the first premise. &gt; &gt;    Argument for the first premise. &gt; &gt;1) Being from non-being (BfNb) is not possible (Ex-nihilo, nihil fit) &gt; &gt;¬ BfNb &gt; &gt;2) Being from non-being is the same as something coming into being uncaused (Buc) &gt; &gt;∵ Buc ↔ BfNb &gt; &gt;3) Therefore, something coming into being uncaused is not possible &gt; &gt;∴¬ BfNb ↔ ¬ Buc &gt; &gt;4) The negation of something coming into being uncaused is something coming into being caused (Bc) &gt; &gt;∴ ¬ Buc ↔ Bc &gt; &gt;5) Therefore, whatever comes into being must have a cause &gt; &gt;∴ Bc &gt; &gt;    Supplement for premise 2 (why being necessitates cause) from the previous argument &gt; &gt;1) Non-being (Nb) does not posses any attributes (A), powers (P), or qualities (Q) &gt; &gt;Nb ⊃ [ ¬ A ∧ ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q] &gt; &gt;2) Being able to cause (C) something entails being (B), and is a power. &gt; &gt;C ⊃ B ∧ C ⊃ P &gt; &gt;3) Being is the exact same as the negation of non-being &gt; &gt;B ↔ ¬ Nb &gt; &gt;4) Therefore, Causes implies Being and the negation of Non-being (if something is caused then it is caused by being) &gt; &gt;∴ C ⊃ [ ¬ Nb ↔ B ] ∧ C ⊃ P ⊃ ¬ Nb  There are full treatments of Krauss's work elsewhere. I only touched on what you brought up (Net energy and virtual particles).   &gt;You already know everything.  Ad hominem again.  &gt; Ironic? No.  Yes it is. You were discussing what models are and how they are applied in scientific pursuits. You also go on to mention the proper methodology that should be taken in the field of theoretical physics. That is not science, that is philosophy of science.  &gt;All he states is the new theoretical model doesn't match the classic model.   Where did he say this?",↔

WHICH IS INCORRECT:  &gt;However examples of the use of gender to refer to masculinity and femininity as types are found throughout the history of Modern English (from about the 14th century). &gt; &gt;   *  1387–8: No mo genders been there but masculine, and femynyne, all the remnaunte been no genders but of grace, in facultie of grammar—Thomas Usk, The Testament of Love II iii (Walter William Skeat) 13. &gt;*     c. 1460: Has thou oght written there of the femynyn gendere?—Towneley Mystery Plays xxx 161 Act One. &gt;*     1632: Here's a woman! The soul of Hercules has got into her. She has a spirit, is more masculine Than the first gender—Shackerley Marmion, Holland's Leaguer III iv. &gt;*     1658: The Psyche, or soul, of Tiresias is of the masculine gender—Thomas Browne, Hydriotaphia. &gt;*     1709: Of the fair sex ... my only consolation for being of that gender has been the assurance it gave me of never being married to any one among them—Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters to Mrs Wortley lxvi 108. &gt;*     1768: I may add the gender too of the person I am to govern—Laurence Sterne, A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy. &gt;*     1859: Black divinities of the feminine 'gender —Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities. &gt;*     1874: It is exactly as if there were a sex in mountains, and their contours and curves and complexions were here all of the feminine gender—Henry James, 'A Chain of Italian Cities', The Atlantic Monthly 33 (February, p. 162.) &gt;*     1892: She was uncertain as to his gender—Robert Grant, 'Reflections of a Married Man', Scribner's Magazine 11 (March, p. 376.) &gt;*     1896: As to one's success in the work one does, surely that is not a question of gender either—Daily News 17 July. &gt;*     c. 1900: Our most lively impression is that the sun is there assumed to be of the feminine gender—Henry James, Essays on Literature.  REGARDING CULTURAL MARXISM:  &gt;The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates from the work of John Money (1955), and was popularized and developed by the feminist movement from the 1970s onwards  READ THE ARTICLE ON[John Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money) AND YOU'LL KNOW [HOW WICKED THAT IDEOLOGY IS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer)  HE RUINED THAT BOYS LIFE IN ORDER TO PROOF HIS SICK DELUSION THAT GENDER IS A social construct™ AND NOT THE SAME AS SEX,  TWISTED BASTARD.",™

t5_2rm6q,gskim2,1380788000,"Hi there, Thank you so much for sharing this with us. You being cognizant about the fact that you need help and actually wanting it is a great start to the process. It takes a really courageous person to do that:) I hope I can help you feel like you can get help. I'm so sorry about your struggles. But no matter what situation youre in you have all it takes to get better. Financial burdens are difficult to figure out but there are resources out there that can help you get the care you so much need and deserve. For seeing a therapist I would recommend you to search up practicing mfts in your area and call them for a free consultation over the phone. Explain what situation you're in and ask if they do pro bono work, which is therapy at no cost. If they don't, ask them for any other places you can try to get help. Don't be afraid, asking for help isn't weakness, it takes balls to say you need help and that's really admirable. If you can't trust your school officials or parents, try asking people on anonymous hotlines to just help you. Getting any kind of help is better than none and money should never be a reason or excuse. Your health is priceless and people who know that will support you. The most important thing is to not give up. Getting help may seem so difficult especially when your family isnt there to support you, but you can get better and it's so worth the effort even when it seems like another burden.  I hope that helped a little bit!! Here are some free online resources but always feel free to message me more if you need more help!!!! Never think you're alone or the situation is hopeless-there are so many people willing to help you when you continue to seek help!! Best wishes ♥ http://www.katimorton.com/ and http://www.selfinjury.com/",♥

Most likely she will try to ramp you up safely, though she might not start super low.  And I don't think you get to choose how much feminization you get. Once your hormone levels (these should be tested) reach female norms, your body takes it from there. Good luck! ♥  Re: ramen noodles... the deal is that those bricks you get at the grocery store aren't *real* ramen! You need to go to a ramen restaurant or asian grocery to get those!

What other dark magicial techniques could you share to Strange players, if any? How do you think he should be played?  3. I've done a lot of research in an attempt to make Ghost Rider a viable character, and I think he has a lot of underused strengths. Do you have any big thoughts on the character? I think he's strong.  4. I made a video a while ago about air dashing after an air EM disruptor. I'm not a Magneto player so I don't know how useful it is.

t5_2qh1i,brocolicookies,1380820493,"Desiderata-  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2qi2i,MercuryPDX,1380824445,"I responded to an ad from AFA (American Fresh Air) in a Valpak mailer that offered a $49 Air Duct cleaning. They showed up on time, in a branded truck, with all the proper equipment and began to set up.   Once all the equipment was in place one of the guys snapped into sales mode. He asked to look at the furnace, and I showed it to him. They offered to clean the furnace too... for an additional $150 or a ""deeper cleaning"" where they actually took the furnace apart and cleaned everything for $400. I said ""No thanks. Just clean the ducts.""  He started the hard sell saying that if they didn't clean the furnace, they would probably be back in 6 months to clean the ducts again. So naturally, he then pitched their ""automatic maintenance service"" where they would come back every 6 months to clean. (Pro tip: Your ducts will not get that dirty every 6 months... this is a scam.). I politely declined.  After about 20 minutes, the same guy comes up to me and starts going on about *mold and other creepy crawlies living in the dark ducts* that could very easily be eliminated with these special UV lights they can pass through all the ducts to kill everything... for another $200. I declined again.  Just as the guy was winding up to deliver his next pitch about Dryer Vent Safety™, I interrupted and said ""Let me stop you right here. I called you up for a $49 air duct cleaning, and that is all I want. I am not interested in any of the other services you are offering. Just clean the ducts, and move on.""  He explained that they lose money on this $49 deal, and rely on homeowners to buy the add-ons to make it worth their while to come out. I told him his [""Loss Leader""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader) was not my problem, and waiting until after getting into someones house to hit them with a sales pitch was a shitty way to do business.   An hour later they finished up and packed up their equipment. He presented me with an invoice for $79 (plus tax) that included a $30 surcharge because ""my vents and return were on the ceiling and not in the floor"". I told him that since he did NOT mention it before they set up, and it was not mentioned anywhere on the coupon that he was authorized to charge $49 (plus tax) on my card, and that was it. I would charge back anything else.  After they left I reported them to the BBB (not that that ever really does anything).   **TL;DR: [Be wary of deals](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2008/02/scam-alert-avoid-dirty-duct-cleaners/index.htm).** Companies use them as Loss Leaders, get into your home, and hit you with the ""hard sell"" on other services.

Multiple zones will not be broken down into smaller quest packs.   **Q29: Lethallethality: Will Big Battles be considered a part of the quest pack or will they be treated as instances and raids have been treated in the past, and be required to be purchased separately or via the full expansion?**  **A29:**Since there will not be separate quest packs for Helm’s Deep™, Big Battles will only be accessible to those who purchase the full expansion.    **General**  **Q30: SpongedarkSquarepants: Will we hear any new info on the housing update before the release of Helms Deep?**  **A30:HoarseDev:**We have some of the early bits in (changes to house inventory). We are prototyping more features and will continue to develop and add to live. Housing work is going to come in phases.  **Q31: Cheery: Will there be expanded use of Mithril Coins?**  **A31: Amlug""**Mithril coins will be expanded to include: new Housing Storage slots, trait tree configurations, and new barter vendors in the newbie areas.  **Q32: RJFerret: With the introduction of up-scaling, are there any plans for down-scaling to fixed instance levels in the future?**  **A32: jwbarry:**Not currently. Once upscaling has been out and pounded on for a while and we feel it’s gotten a chance to get really dialed in we’ll start to evaluate the opportunities to extend and expand it. However, in general, consistency is an important and powerful thing, and it would be odd to have some instances scale themselves and others scale you when both are the same style of instance and content  **Q33: Roxxy: Do we need to have Riders of Rohan to be able to participate in the Helm's Deep content?**  **A33:** No. As long as you have purchased the Helm’s Deep™ expansion you will be able to enjoy all the content in Helm’s Deep™. No previous expansion packs are required.  **Q34: Frickinmuck: Will this expansion include any revamps of earlier content or regions?**  **A34:**No revamps this time around, but this is something we’re hoping to continue as soon as we wrap up development on the expansion pack.  **Q35: Witch0King: Will the epics in this expansion finally end Volume III?**  **A35: MadeOfLions:**Not just yet. After the three Books of this expansion, I think Volume III will have one more Epic Book before Allies of the King concludes.  **Q:36 Grimdi: Will there be a seals reset at HD launch?**  **A36:jwbarry:**Yes. We’ll also be evaluating the sources of seals and the quantities and frequencies with which they’re delivered through those means.  **Q:37 Brya: Will skirmish raid loot be made BoE instead of BoA, to bring it in line with other endgame loot?**  **A37: Verizal:**Yes, as it stands, all incomparable (and lesser gear quality) loot drops are intended to be BoE .  **Q38: Honvikuk: Will 1st ages be available for level 95's on release and how will we be able to get them?**  **A38: Verizal:**No, 1st Ages will not be available until later updates  **Q39: Eyeslayer600: I heard you guys would possibly update the System Requirements of LotRO. If you are, what are the new requirements?**  **A39:** You heard right! This is an ongoing discussion and has been for some time. I will say that we have a proposal on the table for new computer min specs, but until we make a decision on whether or not to pursue this proposal it would be premature to publish any specifics.  **Q40: Palantorio: According to rumors, the Epic quest line will no longer be playable for free to play players and will only be available if you purchase the expansion. In the past we were told the Epic story would be free. Why the change?**  **A40: MadeOfLions:** The Epic Storyline began life as paid content, and when LOTRO became Free To Play we converted many of the Epic Books in order to make them playable by anyone. Every Book of ‘Volume I: Shadows of Angmar,’ every Book of ‘Volume II: Mines of Moria,’ and every Book we’ve released so far of ‘Volume III: Allies of the King’ is free. That’s thirty-four Epic Books, and those will remain free. Since we wanted the Epic Story for this expansion to tell the story of the Battle of the Hornburg, we needed to tie it into the Epic Battles system, which is a paid part of the expansion. Sometimes the Epic Story needs to tie into the region content or into a new system in order to properly represent the tales of Middle-earth we’re telling. It provides a more compelling experience to those who purchase the expansion, and I think that’s worthwhile.",™

t5_2w2s8,velawesomeraptors,1380838935,"Well, I found their website.  This program is run by the BLM (Bureau of Land Management).  Here is a quote from the website:  &gt;The Save the Mustangs Fund was established in May 2005 by the Ford Motor Company in collaboration with the BLM and Take Pride in America.  The fund was created to accept donations to help raise public awareness of the urgency of wild horse and burro issues and to find good homes for them.  The Save the Mustangs fund builds public awareness and support for wild horses.    &gt;The BLM, which manages more than 38,000 free-roaming horses and burros on public lands, places thousands of these animals into private care each year.  Take Pride in America, which administers the Save the Mustangs fund, will distribute money to qualified wild horse and equine rescue groups that purchase horses.   &gt;Take Pride in America® is a national partnership program that enables individuals, civic groups, corporations, and others to volunteer in caring for the lands shared by all Americans.  Take Pride's goal is to instill an active sense of ownership and responsibility in every citizen for the nation's natural, cultural, and historic resources.   So, first of all, it seems like most of the money for this comes from a fund established by a private company, not the federal government (although they are still federal employees).  Thus, your taxes didn't even pay for this.  Actually, the groups that adopt horses and burros will get tax breaks.  Wild horses and burros are kind of an important symbol of the american west.  I think this program is an alternative to mass culling, which a lot of people dislike.  And the reason that the government is running it is because (probably) nobody else wants to or has the resources.",®

Please note that the stats can take up to an hour to reflect properly in game or on Battlelog. This will mean that if you unlock a certain weapon or attachment it can take up to 1 hour before it will become available for play.  &gt;  &gt; - Medical and Ammo packs may « disappear » after being thrown, but they will still provide support.  &gt;  &gt; - You may be « teleported » in the air if you attempt to use the elevators after the Skyscraper Levolution-Event.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; PC:  &gt;  &gt; - We have received reports of Freezes and Crashes affecting the BF4 Beta client. Our team is currently investigating this matter and we will update you here as soon as we know more.  &gt;  &gt; If you are affected by a Freeze or a Crash upon joining a game, and the error message “BF4 Beta has stopped working” appears, please make sure your Windows is fully updated and your Graphic card is running on its latest driver. Alternatively, some players using GeForce drivers were able to fix this by downgrading their driver to an earlier version.  &gt;  &gt; - We received report of unusually low performances, and are currently looking into that as well.  &gt;  &gt; - Please note that the Battlefield 4 Beta does not support Win32 and 32 Bit operating systems.  &gt;  &gt; - Video settings may not be saved after rebooting the game.  &gt;  &gt; - The tooltip “E” to enter the Venom is visible at a 400 meter distance.  &gt;  &gt; - Punkbuster Crashing issues: http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2955065213718181188/ [battlelog.battlefield.com]  &gt;  &gt; Xbox360:  &gt;  &gt; - Player stats in Battledash may not match the stats displayed on Battlelog.  &gt;  &gt; - You may experience an 8 seconds non-interactive pause, when leaving a Multiplayer session or after pressing Start when booting the game.  &gt;  &gt; - You may be floating if you jump on the bollards.  &gt;  &gt; - Cruise Missiles may not destroy any vehicle dropped by Vehicle Drop.  &gt;  &gt; - The requirements for unlock criteria may not be displayed.  &gt;  &gt; - Two flag icons may appear overlapping on each other at each flag point.  &gt;  &gt; - The first attachment of any weapon that is not unlocked, will be the only attachment shown for the first unlocked weapon.  &gt;  &gt; (PS3 and Xbox360)  &gt;  &gt; - If you’re disconnected from the EA Servers, the Main Menu tiles remains fixed in the front end.  &gt;  &gt; PS3:  &gt;  &gt; - When you choose to quit during the EOR, you may be able to see “underworld” for 1 second.  &gt;  &gt; - The camera transition before the EOR screen is under water.  &gt;  &gt; - If you destroy an enemy tank near the Flag A, it may triggers the map’s Mini-Levolution event.  &gt;  &gt; - If you quit from the XMB™ menu after the “Press Start” screen, you may experience a forced shutdown.  &gt;  &gt; - The background screen for the losing team during EOR, is placed “under the game world” for Domination and Obliteration game modes.  &gt;  &gt; - The Hit Indicator is not present when shooting at enemies.  &gt;  &gt; - The EOD Bot can’t arm or disarm MCOMs on Rush mode.  &gt;  &gt; - If you disconnect and reconnect your Ethernet cable while playing, the Game may remain in an endless loading loop.  &gt;  &gt; - You may not be able to perform a knife takedown on an enemy using the TAW Launcher.  &gt;  &gt; - If you sign out from PSN while loading into a MultiPlayer server, you may experience an infinite loading screen.  &gt;  &gt; - In the Soldier Progression menu, you may be able to see upcoming vehicle unlocks that will not be available in the Beta.  &gt;  &gt; - You may be able to see several Medals, Ribbons, and Dog Tags in the “My Soldier” menu.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; If you are currently experiencing any issue listed above, rest assured that our team is currently looking into it internally. &gt;  &gt; If there’s anything you can add about an issue, that was not mentioned (details or context that you think might help, or possibly, a work-around that proved efficient on your end), please feel free to post about it.  &gt;  &gt; We will continue to update this list from your feedback.  &gt;  &gt; Thank you for your participation on the BF4 Beta!!",™

t5_2qh96,tzenrick,1380879948,"The Rainbow Bridge inspired by a Norse legend  By the edge of a woods, at the foot of a hill,  Is a lush, green meadow where time stands still.  Where the friends of man and woman do run,  When their time on earth is over and done.  For here, between this world and the next,  Is a place where each beloved creature finds rest.  On this golden land, they wait and they play,  Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.  No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness,  For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness.  Their limbs are restored, their health renewed,  Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.  They romp through the grass, without even a care,  Until one day they start, and sniff at the air.  All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back,  Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.  For just at that instant, their eyes have met;  Together again, both person and pet.  So they run to each other, these friends from long past,  The time of their parting is over at last.  The sadness they felt while they were apart,  Has turned into joy once more in each heart.  They embrace with a love that will last forever,  And then, side-by-side, they cross over… together.  © 1998 Steve and Diane Bodofsky.   tl;dr  Have a nice cry.",©

Seems I recall Jesus, who by the way wasn't a ""True Christian™"", but rather a Jew, said to be a ""True Christian™"" simply required to love God and love everyone else in the same manner. All else is commentary.  The O.T. is not a literal work. It is the story of how the nation of Israel rose up and how through them God put into place the process through which man was to be restored fully back into fellowship with Him.

It is an absurd and illogical conclusion, and one which is facially invalid.    You are not backing out because of a lack of time.  You are simply incapable of demonstrating the efficacy of the flu shot at greater than 2% and would rather obfuscate that fact in order to save face.  Please prove me wrong.  And you are not alone in that regard.  Nobody has demonstrated efficacy of the flu shot at being grater than 2% in a subreddit dedicated to health where we would assume health care professionals are regulars (either that or a lot of unqualified idiots are giving out quasi-medical advice around here).    This thread has convinced me beyond my previous research that the flu shot is less than 2% effective.  And much less than that for healthy adults.  I'm still open to being proven wrong, but baseless assertions and excuses don't convince me to put aside my well reasoned and evidenced beliefs.  ",®

t5_2rbuf,jmranes,1380907582,"Here is the CDC smoking cessation sheet - again no 6.2%?   Overview  Tobacco use can lead to tobacco/nicotine dependence and serious health problems. Cessation can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from smoking-related diseases. Tobacco/nicotine dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated interventions, but effective treatments and helpful resources exist. Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers.1  Nicotine Dependence  Nicotine is the psychoactive drug in tobacco products that produces dependence.2,3,4,5 Most smokers are dependent on nicotine.2,3 Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States.6 Research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol.3,5 Quitting smoking is difficult and may require multiple attempts.3,4 Users often relapse because of stress, weight gain, and withdrawal symptoms.2,3,4 Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may include irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite.1,2,3 Health Benefits of Cessation  Breaking free from nicotine dependence is not the only reason to quit smoking. Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals; hundreds are toxic, and about 70 can cause cancer.3,7 Tobacco smoke can cause serious health problems, numerous diseases, and death.3  Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, cessation is beneficial at all ages.3,8,9  Smoking cessation is associated with the following health benefits:3,8,9  Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer. Smoking cessation reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Coronary heart disease risk is substantially reduced within 1 to 2 years of quitting. Smoking cessation reduces respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The rate of decline in lung function is slower among people who quit smoking than among those who continue to smoke. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Smoking cessation by women during their reproductive years reduces the risk for infertility. Women who stop smoking during pregnancy also reduce their risk of having a low birth weight baby. Smokers' Attempts to Quit  Among current U.S. adult smokers, 68.8% report that they want to quit completely, and millions have attempted to quit smoking.1 Starting in 2002, the number of former smokers has exceeded the number of current smokers.1  Percentage of adult smokers who stopped smoking for more than 1 day in 2010 because they were trying to quit:  52.4% of all adult smokers (23.7 million people)1,10 62.4% of smokers aged 18–24 years1                    56.9% of smokers aged 25–44 years1                    45.5% of smokers aged 45–64 years1                    43.5% of smokers aged 65 years or older1             Percentage of high school smokers who stopped smoking for more than 1 day in 2009 because they were trying to quit:  50.8% of all high school students who smoke11 Methods to Quit Smoking  The majority of cigarette smokers quit without using evidence-based cessation treatments.1 However, the following treatments are proven effective for smokers who want help to quit:2  Brief clinical interventions (i.e., when a doctor takes 10 minutes or less to deliver advice and assistance about quitting) Counseling (e.g., individual, group, or telephone counseling and quitlines; online smoking cessation programs) Behavioral cessation therapies (e.g., training in problem solving) Treatments with more person-to-person contact and intensity (e.g., more time with counselors) Cessation medications found to be effective for treating tobacco dependence include the following:  Nicotine replacement products1 Over-the-counter (e.g., nicotine patch, gum, lozenge) Prescription (e.g., nicotine inhaler, nasal spray) Prescription non-nicotine medications, such as bupropion SR (Zyban®)2 and varenicline tartrate (Chantix®).2,12 The combination of medication and counseling is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone.2 ",®

I agree, I tell him. I do want to control how you spend **the welfare money that you receive** (EDIT: I also make sure to point out that I couldn't give a shit less what he does with any money he earns. *that* would be *his* money.) I never agreed on any system that allows you to take out money in cash and spend it on weed instead of bills or looking for work.  What state are you in? I'm in CA, and I think your impression of how the system works is not right.  Here is a link to a news story of what I am talking about: http://nypost.com/2013/01/06/welfare-recipients-take-out-cash-at-strip-clubs-liquor-stores-and-x-rated-shops/  Here is Connecticut EBT card policy, and I am betting I can find a similar link for your state:  http://www.ct.gov/dss/cwp/view.asp?a=2349&amp;q=304628  &gt;To Get Cash at the Store   &gt;Get your balance by looking at your receipt, or call 1-888-328-2666.  &gt;Look for the Quest® mark.  &gt;Your card is swiped.  &gt;Enter your secret PIN on the number pad, then press Enter.  &gt;Tell the clerk how much money to enter or enter the amount yourself.  &gt;Check to make sure the amount on the receipt is the same as the amount of cash you received.  &gt;How to Use Your EBT Card at a Cash Machine (ATM)  &gt;Always follow directions on the ATM.  &gt;Enter your secret PIN.  &gt;Press Withdrawal.  &gt;Press Checking.  &gt;Enter the dollar amount you want.  &gt;Take your cash from the machine.  &gt;Wait for your card and receipt.  &gt;Check the receipt to make sure it is the same as the amount you got.  &gt;DO NOT count your money at the machine.   So I promise, I do not think I am making it up.  &gt;I will agree with you though that the system needs more funding...  WHOA!.... I didn't say that in any way at all. I'd be for ""More Funding"" if the system was conducted in any responsible fashion.  It isn't responsible at all.

Here is my version.  **Crawfish Fettuccine**  1 cup butter  6 cloves garlic, diced   2 large onions, chopped   1 poblano pepper, chopped  2 jalapeño peppers, diced  1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms  1/3 cup all-purpose flour  1/2 cup dry white wine  1 cup half-and-half cream  1 can (14 oz.) of diced tomatoes   1 pound american cheese (such as Velveeta), shredded or cubed  2 (16 ounce) packages cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails  1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony's®)  1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine pasta (I had angel hair)  **Directions**  1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  2. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, poblano, and jalapeño peppers. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Add in garlic, mushrooms, and flour and stir constantly for 5 more minutes, scraping the flour from the bottom of the pan. Pour in the wine, half-and-half, tomatoes, and cheese. Bring to a simmer; add the crawfish tails and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Season with Creole seasoning.   3. While making the crawfish sauce, fill a large pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.  4. Divide the pasta between two 9x13 casserole dishes, then pour the crawfish sauce evenly over the pasta.  5. Bake in the preheated oven until the dish is well-heated and bubbly, about 15 minutes.",®

The other thing is flexibility, a conventional machine could easily be a flexible machine for other uses such as a laser cutter/engraver, plotter (remember them) or a printed circuit router.

t5_2qh2a,baldylox,1380926453,"I don't shoot very many weddings - maybe 4 a year or so. I strive to price myself out of that market for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I simply don't have time to do all of the post-production involved. Only we know how much work *that* is.  The only time that I ever ask guests to not take photos is during the posed, planned, formal photography. After that it's all about having fun anyway.  I always talk the bride and groom (meaning bride) into buying a DVD of hi-res images and making their own prints. It's not cheap for my client, but it's a lot less expensive for them than ordering piles of prints.  I post proofs online like everyone else. I explain on each page of the proof album that 'these are lo-res photos not suitable to make a print from, but feel free to download any image you'd like to share with social media. I offer this service at no additional cost and I only ask that you not remove my watermark' - which is always across the entire bottom of the photo all the way across, but not diagonally across the middle rendering the photo useless. The watermark is '©BALDYLOXWEBSITE.COM' - just a simple little custom brush set at 20% opacity and then stamp until it's readable.  It actually worked so well for me that I started doing it with all of my studio sittings as well. People *don't* remove the watermark, and it's free advertising for me. I get a lot more business that way. So download some proofs from my Web site and post them Facebook. Please. I don't mind at all.   More and more photographers are letting go of our old method of hanging on to everything for dear life like we used to do with negatives. Sometimes, you really do make more money by giving away a little something for free.  Like you said - when it's understood that everyone will have a chance to look at the photos online &amp; order prints - the camera chaos will die down.   For the formal portraits, I'll ask politely that no other photos be allowed 'for technical reasons'. That really is true. I can't have 20 different people triggering my strobes constantly. They're distracting to the subjects. Everyone wants to mingle and time is important here. We all know the reasons.  If there's a wedding planner, I'll ask her to say something. It usually sounds nicer coming from her. ",©

t5_2tcp9,WayGroovy,1380930179,"I've been riding the OVH train since December of 2012. Before that, I had been on various VSPs. Previous threads I mentioned my host in: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/148qko/gather_round_the_yule_log_and_share_your_hosting/c8omyef) and [here](http://ww.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/148qko/gather_round_the_yule_log_and_share_your_hosting/c8omyef)  I have the old SP1, at $59/month (old price). I get:  * 16 GB Ram * Intel® Sandy Bridge® CPU i5-3570S @ 3.1 GHz (with 3.8 GHz Turbo Boost) * 100 Mbps connection, unmetered * 2x2TB HD in Raid 1 * dedicated IP + 3 rollover IPs that I *still* haven't figured out how to use yet  I'm currently using this hardware to host   * my main server, /r/waygroovys * a server for /r/foolsgold * a 3GB server for a coworker.  * Backups for some old servers no longer living * IRC BNC bouncer * Mumble server * Apache web server http://waygroovys.com  Some server bench-marking:  * [GeekBench2](http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/view/1705220) score of 10189 * [Disk I/O from iozone](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsUG-_IEV-_OdEVoWEd3SVh2TlRMRm5LdnFGWVdhUmc#gid=5) minimum 877518 Kbps I had some horrible file read write issues in May-ish (right about when core protect changed from flat-file storage to sqlite). I was able to resolve them by backing up my files off server and having OVH reimage my drive/OS without the software raid they had configured. Doing this was the best thing I've done to my server, performance wise.  I've been very happy with ticket response, uptime, and whatnot.   Previously I was with a Kerplunc GSP. I eventually departed from them due to poor trouble ticket response times. I had great service from 2host, but left them due to costs.   If you are a small outlet that can only afford 20-30$ a month, I would not recommend OVH. If you aren't comfortable learning the command line and installing minecraft and java from a linux base install, I would not recommend OVH. If you are technically savvy, have a discretionary budget, and can manage your own files... I'd say go for it (if they weren't sold out).  Looking at what OVH is offering today, I would get the K2, with CentOS 6 64, and try to upgrade the ram to 16 GB. Not sure if they offer  that as an option. ",®

t5_2qh38,mattaugamer,1380930762,"I don't find this difficult to follow and I've never used Doctrine before. What this says to me is that the $post line there is replacing something like       $post = Post::getPost($id);  Which would then have in the Post class something like this      static public function get($id){         $query = 'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = :id';                $prepare = $this-&gt;database-&gt;prepare($query);          // etc.     }       So while you look at the line above and say it puts you off, you surely should be looking at this function and thinking how much nicer it would be to be able to remove it entirely, along with all of its friends.  Frameworks (and the ORMs they tend to use) allow you to write less code, they make large chunks of functionality someone else's problem.  Calling it ""tribal knowledge"" is dismissive, but people with a knowledge of one framework seem to be reasonably able to jump to another. A friend of mine jumped from Cake to Laravel extremely quickly. He understands OOP, he understands framework patterns.    What do you mean ""overhead""?   &gt; all these overcomplications is why so many people prefer to just get shit done™ with plain PHP.  There are three requirements. One stated and two unstated.

t5_2qhag,drinfernoo,1380937215,"I have a few probable answers:  &gt;How did Ms. Hawking know the future and know what was ""supposed to happen""?  She grabbed Daniel's notebook after she killed him in the 70s, leaving her the ""rest"" of her life to study it and learn everything he had up until that point.  &gt;Where did the MIB's limitations come from? (I.e., what changed over the years to make the MIB not be able to cross ash, not cross between the pylons, not be able to breach the roots of a banyan tree, and have to respond when called by that hidden room used by the Egyptians in Ben's closet?)  Arbitrary rules set by Jacob and Smokey, probably. They were playing a ""game"", after all. The pylons were probably invented by DHARMA for that specific purpose, and it's not really concrete that Smokey ""had"" to come to Ben. He probably just did it to make Ben think he had some power over the monster.  &gt;Who was in the cabin/why was the cabin surrounded by ash? (I.e., was Jacob hiding in there to protect himself from MIB, or was it a part of MIB being imprisoned in there; if the latter, how was the ash ring broken, and what was the purpose of imprisoning only part of the MIB in the cabin?)  Smokey was in there being weird. I am pretty sure the cabin was all his doing, and had no real bearing on what happened to Jacob, the Island, or the Losties. He just ""put"" it there to confuse people.  &gt;Why did the Egyptians place the ""cork"" in the Source, and how did that cause the Source to become extinguished when the ""cork"" was removed?  They were experimenting with the timey-wimey properties of the Island, the same way DHARMA was. They engineered some type of system that channeled the Source's energy, and when opened fully, it let it all out.  &gt;Why did Jacob dying prevent the MIB from changing shape? (I have a theory for this one, but it's not particularly solid.)  Another probable arbitrary rule, except this one might be from Mother.  &gt;Why did burning Jacob's ashes bring him back? (I also have a theory for this one, but again, it's not very solid.)  Island Magic™ :D",™

A: ""Well, I look for a bourbon that CAN be sipped, and one that’s worth sipping... On the other hand, I like bourbon whose taste lingers, regardless of what that particular flavor is, and yes, if you’ve ever taken the Kentucky Bourbon Trail® adventure, you know that bourbons have a multitude of flavors.""    Q: How do you like to take your bourbon? Neat, with a little water, or on the rocks?   A: ""If you’re going to drink a good bourbon, you need to just drink it neat or on the rocks.""    Q: What whiskey staple(s) occupy your liquor shelf right now?   A: ""Which particular ones might vary from time to time – and no, I’m not going to name them. I’m a politician, after all.""

t5_2sih3,Eonir,1380957525,"mO4, you've done it again!   The dialogue in this comic is top-notch! It's almost as if it was indeed written by an angry Polish nationalist! It might even be one of the best dialogues I have ever seen on this subreddit!  I also love the waterfall of tears.   The simplicity of expression manages to convey a strong message. The proportion of eyes/ball-size makes Czech and Polan more adorable and identifiable characters.   Czech looks a tiny bit different from the way it's usually drawn. The way you dabbed three colours in a circular fashion instead of trying (and failing) to draw straight lines  makes for a good, simple way to approximate the Czech flag mapped onto a sphere.   What makes this comic especially funny is its message. Ever since the 80s, the eclipse of the golden days of capitalism, the world has plunged into economical wars. The common folk started getting less and less share of the fruits of ever-increasing productivity. This was not necessarily conducted by governments themselves, mind you, but by aggressive predators in the form of multinational corporations.   This story nearly qualifies as a modern fairytale trying to convey an important moral. If it did, it could be called *'The War Already Lost'*, *'The Blindness of Anger'*, *'How Strong and Shrewd defeats Kind and Wise'*, *'War only $1.99'*, or something.   This comic also reminds me of the vein of Depression Month™. It distils a very particular kind of sadness. The double punchline you put in achieves this, I think. The depression of Polan is not enough, he also needs to be enraged enough to forget the sad lesson he learned, thus digging his grave even further!  I give this comic the full score of one upvote out of one. 1/1",™

How long does it take to visually scan the file to find *where* you want to click? Gamers might have better experience with the mouse, but typists are going to be quicker on the keys.  &gt; Plugins and Extensibility  Plugins take a little lovin' to use; but really a plugin isn't going to help you use vim if you don't know how to use vim. Vim's a (mostly) command line tool; you have to be comfortable with operating in a terminal. A lot of the time vim plugins just rehash built-in functionality (NerdTree etc vs the Shell etc, (`ctrl-Z` &amp; `fg` FTW)) Vanilla vim is bad, only if you don't understand vim.  the vimscript site is ugly, like it's been designed by C programmers and engineers ;), not long ago the entire internet looked like [thok.org](http://thok.org). Alot of vimscripts ARE on [github](https://github.com/search?q=vim&amp;type=Repositories&amp;l=VimL), and if you use git &amp; sub-modules they're [very easy](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/) to keep [up-to-date](http://blog.gyoshev.net/2011/08/maintaining-an-up-to-date-vim-configuration-with-git-submodules/).  &gt; vimscript  On no! nobody knows vimscript! Only a small subset of vim users who make plugins! - plugins are nice-to-haves, not necessary features for a text editor. Also, it's not that different from existing languages, most programming uses the same underlying ideas &amp; techniques, and each have their shortcomings; even so, vimscript (aka vimL) is the [14th most popular language on github](http://adambard.com/blog/top-github-languages-for-2013-so-far/).  &gt; collisions  45 plugins? Nobody needs that many, and if they don't work together don't use something else! Stop being lazy and learn what vim itself does, and choose a small set of plugins you will actually learn and use! If you don't use it, you don't need it, and if it's not installed it won't cause problems!  &gt; Vim Is Bad By Design™ 1: Oooooollllld  VIM is designed to edit text over a slow, unreliable connection, from a dumb terminal connected to a mainframe.  You can remap leader to anything though, a lot of people use the spacebar for this because it's otherwise unused. Also you don't need `:arglist` to deal with multiple files, you can use `:buffer` to do it too. `:buffers` or `:ls` to show all open buffers, then you can switch with either the buffer number, or the buffer name (using the shorthand for buffer) `:buff 4`. The `arglist` is like a stable subset of `buffers.`  &gt; GUI  Yes, there's no ""gui"" taking up my screen; So when working remote there's no need to transfer image-data. Vim is a heck of a lot more powerful than pico, which is a gui-like editor in-so-much as it tells you what keystrokes perform which (basic?) functions. (Does pico do much more than it clearly displays? who knows, use vim)  &gt; vim bad at indenting  yes, auto-indenting of large blocks of un-formatted code; but why wouldn't you indent it when you wrote it? Or paste it in with paste-mode so the indents come with it?   &gt; After four years of Vim use, 700 hand written lines in my .vimrc, and 45 plugins...  Oh god! why!? This guy clearly never wanted to learn vim, but to bend it to his will. No wonder he had conflicts. I usually see people using 10 plugins max, and rarely does anybody need a vimrc with over 300 lines,  40 would be better.  ([mine's 201](https://github.com/JKirchartz/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc), but if I ever feel the urge, I'm sure I can remove a lot of it, because they duplicate default values)  having `set -o vi` in bash has been great, I don't need to learn new keybindings for quickly editing commands etc; also I find that if you edit your bash commands, sometimes it becomes impossible to edit the last character `&lt;esc&gt;A` fixes that.   **TL;DR**: VIM is part of a system, that includes the rest of the Shell/OS. They all work together, and can be used together efficiently. Vimscripts are written by a large(ish?) community, so fragmentation's expected. If you really want to use your mouse and the typical GUI experience try gVim or `set mouse=a`.",™

AFAIK most airlines haven't finalized their seating plans. I know at least United is considering 10 abreast on their -1000's  &gt;Technically true, but that is true for every commercial airliner family but for the A380 and the 787. The A330 is being produced at the highest sustained rate of *any commercial wide body ever.* Most of those deliveries are at eight abreast. To my recollection Air Asia X is the only A330 operator at nine abreast currently taking delivery.  Sorry, that was supposed to say orders and not deliveries. But yes, newer western orders are also for eight abreast. SAS for example. Seriously thought, nine abreast on a 330 must be horrible. 16.5"". Still better than the estimated 16"" on the 350 ten abreast.  &gt;The interior is buyer furnished equipment, if you tell Boeing to install an eight abreast interior in your brand new 767 they will happily oblige.  Sure, I was just wondering if you knew whether or not Boeing had ever actually delivered an aircraft with eight abreast seating. If not that might explain why it's not listed on their website.    &gt;As you say, *marketing*, I once saw a press release where Airbus tried to peddle their (absolutely gorgeous, alas looks doesn't sell in commercial aviation) A340-500 by comparing it to the competition on the one route where it actually won out, over the Himalayas... Again, no lie but stretching the truth a bit. As for panoramic windows, yeah you need to fly [a Boeing](http://www.airplane-pictures.net/images/uploaded-images/2009-1/4/32985.jpg) for that.  Yeah, I know Boeing has done same thing on many occasions. Marketing people in general are tricky. If only all aircraft windows were like that. Not feasibly of course, but it would be a great world to live in.  &gt;As for having three seats for your selves, check out Air New Zealand's [Skycouch™](http://www.airnewzealand.com/economy-skycouch) in their (incidentally ten abreast) 777s.

t5_2qh1i,M_Bus,1380999955,"False.  To quote Dennis Tueller, a former firearms instructor for the Salt Lake Police Academy, &gt;...Since we already knew the average time it takes to draw, fire, and hit a target at seven yards – which was about 1 1/2 seconds from the holster – I decided to see just how long it would take someone to cover that same distance.  &gt;So we had one recruit officer play the role of the “bad guy” and another played the role of the “startled officer.” We put them 21 feet apart, and when the bad guy role player decided to start his attack, we started the stopwatch, and when the bad guy made contact with the good guy, we stopped the watch. I was quite stunned to discover that the time was roughly 1 1/2 seconds!  &gt;Then we tried the same exercise with everyone available in the class – some younger, some older, big and small, male and female – and all of them could run that seven yard distance in about 1 1/2 seconds. Of course, this was before Simunitions® or Airsoft®, but later we did test it with dart pistols. What we found was that if you’re ready and if everything goes perfectly, you might get the gun out and get a shot off before the bad guy role player makes contact. That is not good enough! Shooting does not stop the action.  Look up the article ""How Close is Too Close"" by same. Basically, if the assailant is within 21 feet, they can close the gap at least as fast as you can draw - IF you see it coming. If someone walks up behind you, for instance, it would be extremely easy to overtake you before the handgun can even come out.",®

I'm addressing the guys who ARE coming across as creepy and crying foul.  &gt; which I find to be magnificently hypocritical given the excoriation that Nice Guys™ get  Again this either-or you are stuck on. These are very different situations. In the Nice-Guy situation the man and the woman are already well acquainted. In the situation discussed here they are not.  Lastly you claim you believe that women are beings with agency, but apparently that agency does not extend to ""allowed to feel repulsed by a creepy guy hitting on her.""  &gt; It's like I'm supposed to be a little obedient pet, who gets sexual rewards when I've been good.

t5_2sa4t,doubleme,1381002472,"Low carb is a great, great option (check out /r/keto!). Sadly it's harder on campus, but it's definitely still doable. I get food on campus all the time but sadly it's mostly bacon cheeseburgers without the bun at West Side (significantly better during the day than at night), burgers without the bun at Wendy's, half caesar salads at Wendy's with grilled chicken instead of spicy, and that's basically it. If you can get off campus, spinach bowls with steak, vegetables, cheese, guac, etc. at Cabo Fresh are really good, as well as Fajita Burrito Bowls at Green Cactus. Also, if you can make it to Buffalo Wild Wings, their Parmesan Garlic and Hot sauces on traditional wings are low carb (~10g for 10 wings with sauce &amp; a blue cheese).  Other options that I don't do are maybe making some custom low-carb salads at the SAC's DIY section, or even eating the cheese &amp; toppings off pizza (although that seems very unappealing at Stony, since the pizza isn't very good to begin with).  Also, don't bother seeing the campus nutritionist. She doesn't know anything about low carb diets and as they're not the official recommended diet that she was taught in school, she will try to steer you away. Also, as a result, there is zero push for low carb options on campus, since that's Not Healthy™.  If you're doing this for the long haul, I suggest trying to get into a cooking suite next year, or even get your doctor to write you a note and try to have DSS move you into one sooner. Making your own food is the best and most delicious way to eat low carb on campus.",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1381011202,"it's time for **RageChat™**  was going to post a review last night but i was too baked for it to be any good (yes i smoke weed deal with it). also i wanted to be a bit more objective, because i was laughing my ass off at this and i wanted to see if that stayed true in the light of day.  it has, and i have to say i'm beyond impressed at how music defener comics are starting to shape up. i don't know as-yet if there's much more longevity in the format - much like [Trevor 2.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/f7u12_ham/comments/1njd8d/le_yolo_beiber_bully_defeated_by_my_superior/) this RageComic™ doesn't introduce any new elements that make it rise above its station as a genre exercise - but if nothing else i think we've seen that these comics can still deliver in spades.  as often is the case, the devil is in the details. panels 7 &amp; 8 use a RageFace™ whose mouth is a riff on trollfun's [uncle](http://i.imgur.com/2h3e8Ed.png), panel s &amp; 11 bring back the [original defener face](http://i.imgur.com/UWQ39.jpg), , and panel 6 uses the angry face also found in the original defener comic. now i love sly nods to RageHistory™ perhaps more than some, but there's also some solid new material in here as well. OP really knows how to to string a sentence together, and it's used here to great effect; ""pardon my words"" &amp; ""i was mad at this point by his idiocy"" are among the best one-liners i've read.  and what i really love about this is that we finally have an OP who is clearly just as pathetic as the bully he conquers; he just doesn't realise it. up until now music defener comics have *in theory* been about stupid kids yelling at stupid kids but this has never really translated to the comics perfectly. but OP really runs himself into the ground here: constantly mis-spelling Freddy Mercury, only knowing Bohemian Rhapsody, evolving the ""uses gentlemanly words &amp; conduct"" trope into a ""overly prudish word censorer"" one, the fact that the RageFace™ in panels 7 &amp; 8 is cross-eyed, the *fantastically* autistic description of the fight, and the final nail in his own coffin that he's a big ol' God fan right at the end. there hasn't yet been a defener of music who was just so completely &amp; totally pathetic, and that's a big deal in my eyes.  this is a great RageComic™, and where Trevor 2.0 made me feel like the music defener genre wasn't finished yet, this one fills me with genuine hope for the future. let's see where the momentum goes from here.  **RageScore™**: 85  **RageChoice™ nominee, October 2013**",™

t5_2qhue,ArtistEngineer,1381015596,"In general, having capacitors on your power rails rarely if ever does any harm, especially at the breadboarding level of electronics development.  Specifically, it helps to overcome any inductance in the wires and power rails (internal in the breadboard) in general and it may help to divert any high frequency noise away from other areas of the circuit - Your Mileage May Vary.   The power rail is physically long in a breadboard and newcomers may have quite a distance between the power source and the point from where the draw the power. The capacitor provides a local power storage for sudden surges of current (AC current).  Breadboards can cause Weird Shit™ to occur in your circuit. From experience, putting these capacitors on the power rails at least eliminates any problems with the power supply part of my circuit. I tend to put a 100uF capacitor at each end of the power rails, as well as decoupling capacitors on any ICs that I use.",™

As for Dust, it really isn't going against Battlefield and CoD. People do compare the two, but Dust is far more persistent than either, in the sense that ""your battles actually matter™"" (well, that's the goal anyway).

t5_2qm4e,rigged_finger,1381027598,"A transistor is a 3 terminal device. Two of the terminals are connected between a constant voltage source - in case of a mosfet for most cases, it is the source and the drain terminal. The third terminal is connected to the signal source which is typically very small compared to the constant voltage applied between the other 2 terminals in an amplifier; in a mosfet this is the gate terminal. So the trick is to somehow capture the change in the voltage of the signal source and reflect it between the other two terminals. One way to achieve that is, if somehow the signal voltage could control the resistance between the other 2 terminals. So what happens when the resistance changes? Well, since the voltage between the two terminals is constant the current varies. So a change in the signal voltage gives rise to a change in the current flow between the other two terminals. Ok great, but how does it give me a gain? Since the voltage between the other 2 terminals is much higher than the input voltage, a small change in input causes a large change in the current. So we have achieved a gain . Now the question is how to make a device in which a change in input voltage causes a change in the resistance between the other 2 terminals? In a Mosfet, the gate voltage (input) is used to create a path for current  between the other 2 terminals ( source, drain).  In a NMOS when the gate voltage is too low, there is no path so no current flows. As the gate voltage is increased beyond a threshold voltage, a path gets created and current flows. So the gate voltage applied can control the current between the other 2 terminals.Note: this explanation is in terms of a MOSFET and is pretty basic. For more detailed info refer a circuits book. 😊Also typed in a cellphone so there could be typos...",😊

Living your life to make others happy is to be in jail.  Good luck, be happy.  Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

On this golden land, they wait and they play,  Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.  No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness,  For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness.  Their limbs are restored, their health renewed,  Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.  They romp through the grass, without even a care,  Until one day they start, and sniff at the air.  All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back,  Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.  For just at that instant, their eyes have met;  Together again, both person and pet.  So they run to each other, these friends from long past,  The time of their parting is over at last.  The sadness they felt while they were apart,  Has turned into joy once more in each heart.

[Source maybe?](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=490085)  **""**Well, I guess it’s time I add my two cents to the topic. My name is Ted and I am the author of the story you have been discussing. I am the original author. I created the story on my own and copied no one.  I will explain the details of the creation of the story in a moment, but first let me just say — WOW!! I am still thrilled and amazed by all of the discussion that my story has generated. I was unaware of just how far the story had circulated until Yvonne contacted me a few weeks ago. I was aware of how many people had visited MY web site (the angelfire site) because of the counter on the site, and that number has been slowly climbing since I started the site. But I had no idea that two other people had copied the site, with one going so far as adding an “alternate ending” complete with a doctored photo! And I had no idea that the story had been discussed on numerous forums!  I want to thank everyone who took the time to read the story. I hope you enjoyed it. It took a long time to write and even though there are a few things I would change, I am happy with how it turned out.  The recent events leading up to this post are as follows: I was contacted by my friend Brad (the ‘B’ in my story) a few weeks ago concerning an email he received from Yvonne. He mentioned that Yvonne was seeking the author of the “Caver Ted” story in order to obtain permission to translate it into French. I gave him my approval to pass along my name, email, and phone number to her. Two weeks ago I received an email from Yvonne making the same request, adding that there was a discussion in progress on the NSS web page concerning my story, and whether or not I was the original author. I was floored, as I mentioned above. But I was shocked and REALLY disappointed to learn that credit for writing the story was given to someone else. SO, I’ll take you back to the beginning and run through how the story came about, then I’ll discuss “proof” of authorship belonging to me.  I’ll begin by giving everyone an outline of the creation of my story. Most of the following is what I wrote to Yvonne.  Between December 30, 1999 and February 24, 2000 Brad and I worked on a passage in Freeway cave. We made numerous trips, and spent many hours of hard work, before we were finally able to get through the opening and into the new section of cave. During the course of our adventure I kept a caving journal and documented our activities surrounding our attempts to be the first people to enter the new passage. Since we were giving friends and family members updates as we worked, I thought it would be a good idea to put my entire journal on a web page, along with our pictures, then we could simply refer people to the site.  The thought then occurred to me: It sure would be fun to embellish the story a little! From there it was a short leap to simply creating a work of fiction based on our experiences. I felt like the Internet was the perfect medium for my idea, so that is what I set out to do. For the next year I worked on the story, off and on. Sometime in April (I think) 2001 I posted the first few pages. After that I added them as if it was happening in real-time. After posting the last installment (May 19) I just kicked back and watched the web page counter to see if anyone was stumbling onto the site. (I found one site recently which confirms these dates: http://www.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultim…5/t/000198.html is a forum dated June ’01, shortly after I posted the site)  To summarize the fact vs. fiction discussions about the story, let me just say the parts about the digging and passage through Floyd’s Tomb are, for the most part, true and taken directly out of my caving journal. I intentionally altered a few details of the cave, but as has been mentioned, it still accurately describes Freeway Cave, Floyd’s Tomb, and the passage now known as Gypsum Passage on the map. The supernatural aspects of the story are all pure fabrication. Even the rumbling that both Dale Green and Ralph Powers mentioned exist in the cave did not inspire the story. I simply used them later to add to the mystery! And that is that. Nothing mysterious happened while we worked on the cave. It was just an experience filled with challenge, hard work and lots of satisfaction. The feelings I mentioned while in Floyd’s Tomb were real. That’s what made it so fun to write.  When I learned about the discussion on this forum I did some digging and found other sites discussing the story. As I read all of the different comments about the story I was grinning at the variety of opinions expressed. Some people liked it, some thought it long and boring. Some thought it creepy, some thought it was too farfetched. The negative comments didn’t bother me. That’s life! What did bother me, however, was the accusation that I had copied the story. I felt like my integrity was being challenged, and I don’t like that. That may sound silly, since I was completely anonymous, but I still felt that way. Besides, I didn’t like the notion that someone else was taking credit for my work.  Although I will not likely, or at least not immediately, post on other forums, I will definitely defend my story on this one, since it involves caves and caving. I would like to begin with most obvious evidence: the cave itself. It is clear to anyone who has been in the cave that the story accurately describes Freeway cave. Even using the map as a guide one can “see” that the description resembles the cave. What are the odds someone could have written such an accurate description without seeing the cave? And not just any cave, but a cave that only came to light as a result of construction, as told in the story? As Dale mentioned the cave was opened in the 70’s, so someone could have been through before 1987. But not the new passage! As Ralph stated, and the pictures show, the story accurately describes the ‘Floyd’s Tomb’ section of the cave, the opening, and the passage beyond (although I did take a few creative liberties there with the description, such as the ‘Blair Witch’ hieroglyphics and the round rock). And Ralph, Dale, or any one of dozens of Utah cavers can testify to the approximate date the passage was opened. Now, did Thomas Lera see all of this in a crystal ball to write about it accurately? Or did someone swipe my work?  When the “1987” version surfaced it took all of 15 seconds of reading to recognize it was definitely my story, with a few changes made. I figured I would read it and see if there was some way that I could prove he copied me, but it was difficult. Since 99% of what he wrote was copied verbatim from my story, there was not much to go on, but I did find a few interesting things. Granted, this is little more than circumstantial evidence, but it starts to add up. I’ll try to be brief  1. Isn’t it an incredible coincidence that the story mentions a friend who likes to cave, was injured in a climbing accident, was told he would never walk again, yet managed to beat the odds and through hard work and determination not only walks, but caves, though with some difficulty, AND I HAVE SUCH A FRIEND!?! His name is Brad, his story is true, and both Dale and Ralph can attest to his this. That’s some crystal ball, Lera.  2. The dog we really took in the cave to check out the passage was real (as Ralph mentioned, he died a few years ago). I’ll try to dig up a photo of him in the Tomb. It was a Jack Russell. The Lera version switched it to an Australian Shepard. Hardly a dog to fit in a tight squeeze. See http://www.australianshepherds.org/adult.html  3. On page 15 of the Lera version he mentions the tools we invented and created. TRUE STORY. For part one of evidence I refer you to the photo of Brad: http://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/pictures/b.html he is holding the actual tool. For the second part of the evidence I humbly call upon Ralph Powers. On our last trip into the cave we did not take the pipe wrenches that were necessary to dismantle the tool, consequently we left it in the new passage. Ralph, when you mapped the passage did you find the tool? (Also did you find a mini-mag light? I dropped one in the new passage when I went in with my wife a month after it was opened. LOL) Now how did Lera, in 1987, know we were going to make those tools?  4. In the Lera version he used a cordless drill. In the true version I mentioned a De Walt cordless drill. I don’t know who did this , but check out the map of the cave at http://www.nps.gov/tica/RMweb/MapGa…terstateMap.pdf and zoom in on the entrance to the passage. De Walts Dig! I assume this came from Brads conversation with Ralph about the project (Ralph, can you enlighten us?) Doesn’t really prove anything, but it was just something I noticed. ***See my fixed link below***  Continued below:",©
t5_2tkl6,TemperNE,1381048998,"&gt;I've mentioned the pins (that's ""pin"", as in ""solder pad on the CPU"", not ""PIN"" as in ""password"") on the CPU that need to be asserted and deasserted for things to work as I've described, described an in-the-market implementation at a block diagram level, and more-or-less quoted from the BIOS implementer's guide.  I know EXACTLY what you are talking about I do embedded programming. No need to condescend to me.  &gt;The main benefit of SMM is that it offers a distinct and easily isolated processor environment that operates transparently to the operating system or executive and software applications.  Yes, but it is still a computer. You seemingly ignored many of my links. Including the article on SMM hacking via cache.  http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/03/attacking-smm-memory-via-intel-cpu.html http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20slides.pdf  Again, quite simply, if a computer can read/write to it PHYSICALLY then it can read and write to it at ANYTIME. There is no way to really secure a system. But having a system such as this is a horrible idea as ALL intel systems now become susceptible to the same attack. It is also harder to patch.  &gt;Features do not exist by default. If you can flash the BIOS remotely, it is because the manufacturer intended it to be so. Unauthorized remote firmware flashes are pretty much the opposite of what vPro is trying to accomplish.  Hack into a PC and run the bios flash tool? How hard is this?! Wait Wait.. YOU DOUBLE CLICK ON THE EXECUTABLE.. AKA YOU EXECUTE THE PROGRAM THAT UPDATES!  The rest of you nonsense shows you don't know what is going on. Clearly since you have to enable the Intel Virtualization technology for this to work. This ""second"" system is actually running a VM. I run VMs all the time and the system clock doesn't slow down. This is the biggest bunch of HOGWASH I have ever heard.  And since you value INTEL's own website so much.. Here you have it.. RIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH: http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/remote-configuration-for-intel-amt  ""With the release of Intel® Active Management Technology 3.0, network administrators no longer have to physically visit business PCs to initiate the participation of those machines on the management network. This ""Remote configuration"" capability involves an encryption key being entered into BIOS during device manufacture, which is subsequently used to establish connection between the management infrastructure and the PC. By setting up Intel AMT devices in this way, businesses can save substantially on deployment costs.""  Here it says it all:  ""OEM setup method enables a hardware manufacturer to set up Intel AMT hardware before it leaves the factory, pre-populating the credentials into the BIOS and providing it in a form that can be readily imported into the IT department's Intel SCS environment. This method is required for Remote configuration.""  Arguing this with you is like trying to argue with a wall. You see a computer do something without a physical change, like a DIP switch, and you think it is secure?! In what world do you live in? Name ONE THING that hasn't been hacked? Everything gets hacked. The point is, that when this does get hacked, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW. It won't show up on network traffic, it won't show processes in the process list, it won't show disk activity.  So again, WHY IS THIS SECURE?!  Oh yeah, that's right because they TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS. And, as implied, THEY never lie.  Cut me some slack and give me a FREAKIN break. You are the LAST person I would have secure my HOT DOG STAND.  You also ignore the fact that AMD has essentially the same thing called ""DASH"".  Whatever, believe whatever you want. But you know, somewhere in there, what I am saying is right.",®

t5_2qt49,Anarquisto,1381057753,"Die Berliner sind unfreundlich und rücksichtslos, ruppig und rechthaberisch, Berlin ist abstoßend, laut, dreckig und grau, Baustellen und verstopfte Straßen, wo man geht und steht – aber mir tun alle Menschen leid, die nicht hier leben können!  © Anneliese Bödecker   The people of Berlin are harsh and inconsiderate, abrasive and dogmatic, Berlin is repulsive, loud, dirty and grey construction sites and gridlocked roads everywhere - but i pity everyone who is not able to live here!  I think this is pretty accurate Berlin is a ruff city and people tend to get grim in the winter (myself included ^ ^ ""). So dont take some stuff too personal.     The thing with the so called ""development"" is that its change that was made without asking the people what they want. It was made to make more money and that's what many people dislike here (again myself included). I love that we are a international City and all the different people who come here.   The Problem is Berlin is under a big tension right now. Everything gets more expensive without income rising for the people who are from here or dont have super specialised skills. I know that there are loads of cities in the world that are so much more expensive than Berlin but for us Berliners its really expensive. As an example i cant go out and pay 3 euros for a 0.33l Beer while having payed 10 Euro entrance fee. The people from here see a problem that no one in power wants to talk about (and for some parts cant because they signed the important contracts nearly 10-20 years ago so its too late)   Also from me Welcome :D i hope you find your place in this city and take it as it is and also leave a bit of yourself here without destroying whats already here.   p.s. its also not about creative people coming here its about ""creative"" people coming here. They come and think they are soooo special and will do the best art always talk about the ""project"" they are working on right now (which is actually the same thing they work on since 4 month ago) and are actually just out partying every night and dont contribute anything to Berlin   **disclaimer: Everything in this comment is just my opinion.

t5_2r2jt,aljady,1381058704,"Alright, after Googling around the a little bit, this all looks really fishy and weird.  This ""Lady Prelox"" product seems to be basically a male erectile dysfunction **food supplement** just branded differently. One of the resellers of the original product (Prelox) states that:  &gt; Although there are no current trials on Prelox and women, L-Arginine and Pycnogenol may help maintain a healthy vascular system of both men and women.  So what's the point of a supposedly ""Lady"" specific version in the first place?  What seems to be the [official website](http://www.prelox.com/home/) made by the manufacturer (Horphag Research Ltd) doesn't even mention it - but then it hasn't been updated since 2009. What it does however have is this nifty disclaimer:  &gt; **The statements on this website have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to treat, cure or prevent any disease.**  Alright, nice reassuring start.  About the company itself, there's not a lot of info, except that they tend to [shirk](http://legimobile.fr/fr/jp/a/caa/75056/2011/12/7/08PA04675/) [taxes](http://www.juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURADMINISTRATIVEDAPPELDEPARIS-20111207-08PA04675), and they're focused on nutrition and mostly well-known for something called Pycnogenol (a extract from pine bark they buy from [this company](http://www.biolandes.com/)), that they advertise as an ""antioxydant"" that treats [a surprisingly wide](http://www.pycnogenol.com/applications/properties/?L=) array of ailments. However, [a meta-study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008294.pub3/abstract;jsessionid=192148C5F5911196B4923CC14FD41552.f01t02) on that substance has concluded that:  &gt;Current evidence is insufficient to support Pycnogenol® use for the treatment of any chronic disorder.  Apart from that Pycnogenol, their Prelox product has L-Arginine, [listed](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-875-L-ARGININE.aspx?activeIngredientId=875&amp;activeIngredientName=L-ARGININE) (rather unsurprisingly at this point) under ""Insufficient evidence"" for ""female sexual problems."" I've found [one study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12074777) suggesting that it could work well in conjunction with yohimbine for male ED, an [amazingly shitty one](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926230390155104?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;) saying that's it's *super effective* on its own, and [another one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10743698) that concludes that it is ""*not better than placebo as a first-line treatment for mixed-type impotence.*""  One thing that seems consistent is that both products increase bloodflow. Drugs interaction disasters waiting to happen aside, would those even help ""female sexual dysfunction"", whatever it is. The only thing it could address is the arousal stage, by helping to send more flow to the relevant organs. Which, like, no one knows if that would help anything even if the product worked and was safe.  ---  **tl;dr: [Google](http://www.google.com). It exists.**",®

On September 26th, 2013, Benjamin Cousijnsen received the following message from a messenger angel of God.   Shalom! I greet you in the wonderful name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Michaël, a messenger angel of God.   Verily, you there, you have heard from someone that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is risen and is alive. But what did you do with that, when you heard this? Or do you now hear it for the first time? Yeshua HaMashiach chose for you.  ""For me?"" you ask. Yes, for you! And His suffering was not enough for Him. There was something, that was heavier and still deeper than all the suffering, even though He bore all the sins upon Himself. ‘What was heavier then?’ you think. Now open your heart and listen...    What was heavier and deeper, was His unconditional love for you. This pressed Him on His heart, even though they shouted: ""Barabbas"", who was a robber, a murderer! Even though His road of pain and suffering stood already firm, He came for you and did all this for you. His suffering was a demonic ritual, a hell on earth, that shattered Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Never anyone has suffered so much in love for you!   There is no greater unconditional love, which is only to be found in Him. No Mohammed or Buddha, or some god, had ever so much love for the people, and did such miracles as He did and rose from the dead!  John 3, verse 16  There it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, make your paths straight and bend your knees. Be humble and obedient, and ask Him to come into your heart. And ask Him for forgiveness of all your sins. Make a loving gesture and say, ""Come, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! I give myself to you. Thank you, that you did this all for me. Amen!""

t5_mouw,saijanai,1381080672,"&gt;You can do college and university courses online or learn complex physical training regimens online or via book for far less money. This ludicrous fee is a cash-grab, plain and simple.  TM has reasonably unusual effects and is taught in a reasonably unusual way.    The organization that trains and accredits TM teachers is a non-profit organization. The people who actually RUN the TM organization actually had to pay $1 million dollars for the privilege, or find someone willing to pay the $1 million for them, and to prevent a repeat of the _Deepak CHopra Affair_ ™, high-level members of teh TM organization, while wearing the hat of being a top-level administrator of the TM organization, are literally required to wear a funny hat: [they're required to wear funny robes and a gold crown](http://www.flickr.com/photos/61354696@N05/6006244254/) when they speak ""_Ex Movementa_"". Deepak's ego would never have allowed him to do that when he was a top level administrator of the TM organization.  The David Lynch Foundation works with existing organizations to teach TM for free to veterans with PTSD, American Indians, school kids.  The DLF is reasonably well-respected. For example, earlier this year, Microsoft matched dollar-for-dollar, donations to the DLF to provide TM instruction to people in various high-stress groups http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/newsletter/2013_march.html  Current microprojects are attempting to raise $10,000 to teach TM to [50 American Indian kids in L.A.](http://www.giveforyouth.org/microprojects/teach-meditation-to-50-indigenous-students/), $10,000 to teach TM to [50 kids at Frederick Douglass Academy in LA](http://www.giveforyouth.org/microprojects/teach-meditation-to-50-at-risk-la-youth/), with Microsoft providing matching funds, so the total cost per kid will be $400. That helps pay a decent wage to the TM teacher in LA for a 6 month project.  &gt;Meditation absolutely has a great deal of evidence backing up the claims of efficacy  Actually, up until this year, most major independent reviews of the research on ALL forms of meditation concluded that there wasn't enough good evidence to make any science-based conclusion about the utility of any form of meditation with respect to most things.  Then, in April of this year, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement concerning alternative treatment for hypertension. The summary of the section on meditation and relaxation techniques said:   [Beyond Medications and Diet: Alternative Approaches to Lowering Blood Pressure A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/04/22/HYP.0b013e318293645f.full.pdf)  Published Online April 22, 2013  &gt;**Summary and Clinical Recommendations** [meditation/relaxation research]   &gt;_**The overall evidence supports that TM modestly lowers BP.** It is not certain whether it is truly superior to other meditation techniques in terms of BP lowering because there are few head-to-head studies. As a result of the paucity of data, we are unable to recommend a specific method of practice when TM is used for the treatment of high BP. However, TM (or meditation techniques in general) does not appear to pose significant health risks. **Additional and higher-quality studies are required to provide conclusions on the BP-lowering efficacy of meditation forms other than TM.**_  &gt;_The writing group conferred to TM a Class IIB, Level of Evidence B recommendation in regard to BP-lowering efficacy. **TM may be considered in clinical practice to lower BP.** Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials, all other meditation techniques (including MBSR) received a Class III, no benefit, Level of Evidence C recommendation. **Thus, other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.**_   .  .   &gt;, but these egregiously large online fees for TM are a disgusting means of monetization by organizations that don't give a shit about actually helping people.  TM is always taught in-person by people who are well-trained. All of the active TM teachers I have met over the 40 years I've been practicing have come across as sincere idealists. As I pointed out above, in order to rise to the very top in the TM organization, the old monk decreed that a person had to donate $1 million to the organization, or convince someone else to donate $1 million. That shows a a firm commitment to the organization's goals. There are far better ways to make large amounts of money if you have $1 million handy to donate to an organization like the TM organization than to actually donate money to the TM organization and  you don't have to wear a silly hat in public, either.

t5_2fwo,ForeverAlot,1381080746,"&gt; The disadvantage with the PHP method...  Absolutely. The post I linked isn't really about the Builder pattern, however, and you can implement that more correctly, with as much static analysis as PHP allows, in a different way, though, but it was mostly a tangent.  &gt; EDIT: As for a solution to multiple mandatory parameters, how do you feel about named parameters?  I think it's a solution to a different but related problem. Named parameters allows you flexibility in calling functions and grants some degree of stability in case of future changes to the API (similar to that PHP tangent), both of which are great for programmer productivity. And I *would* love to see named parameters in Java, and just about any other programming language.  However, the Builder pattern provides the (sometimes compile-time enforceable!) guarantee that an object instance will never be invalid. This means that, for instance, you won't have to remember to call the same five C functions in the correct order every time you need to use this particular C library, Or Else™. Importantly, the Builder pattern is *not* about configuring an instance to be the way you want it but to ensure that any such instance will always have the minimum amount of configuration that is necessary to function. That's why I don't think the linked article makes a good example: you need to have mandatory constructor parameters and there needs to be a lot of them (as in, 4+) for the Builder pattern to make sense at all. For reference, I've never needed to use it seriously, myself.  I will also add that I am exceedingly unlikely to even consider the Builder pattern except to avoid constructors with several mandatory parameters. I consider the latter a code smell and the former a work-around, but not a solution, to that code smell. It would be better to rework the original class to have fewer requirements but that's not always an option.",™

t5_mouw,saijanai,1381081924,"&gt;Woah! Those last few sentences.  &gt;So meditating just calms us down only to return us to our stressful environment, basically only doing momentary good.    True Believer™ that I am, I contend that TM is superior to other forms of meditation with respect to stress.  Long-term practice of any form of meditation seems to bring about an EEG trait outside of meditation similar to what is found during meditation.  In just about any form of meditation, short-term practitioners tend to show some heightened level of alpha EEG. However, with mindfulness (open-monitoring) and concentrative (focused attention) forms of meditation, long-term practice of these techniques show less and less alpha EEG during practice and more and more evidence of higher frequencies and it is THIS non-alpha EEG that starts to become the long-term trait shown by long-term non-TM practitioners.  TM practice, on the other hand, shows high levels of alpha EEG power and coherence during practice in beginners AND in advanced practitioners. During TM, the average alpha EEG power and coherence in a 6 month TMer is about the same as in an 8 year TMer. However, outside of TM practice, the trait alpha EEG power and coherence continues to grow, converging towards the average found *during* meditation (which is the same pattern you find with other practices but with other frequencies besides alpha).  So, insomuch as you can claim that alpha EEG and coherence indicate a relaxed functioning of the brain, TMers, at least on the measure of EEG, tend to be more relaxed outside of meditation than practitioners of other forms of meditation.  Preliminary research on meditation practices and PTSD seems to back this up. People with PTSD who learn various forms of meditation tend to show lower PTSD symptoms after a while. [People with PTSD who learn TM show a very dramatic drop in PTSD symptoms within a month or 2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23568415). There's supposed to be a followup on this study showing that a few PTSD victims in that study showed dramatic physiological changes within a week of starting TM.  On the other hand, Buddhist monks who have been practicing mindfulness and concentrative techniques  for decades, [often find they need Western-style therapy because they are unable to meditate due to flashbacks](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102373662).  Currently, the US Department of Defense, and the Office of Veteran's Affairs, are conducting large-scale, multi-year, comparative studies of the effects of various forms of meditation on PTSD in military personnel. We TMers expect TM to come out on top, naturally.",™

In 1.6 the fastest weapon is for some reason the scout at 260 units per second. Behind that are the knife, all pistols and grenades at 250 u/s. SMGs except for P90 also sit at 250 u/s. So in 1.6 running around with the knife puts you at a disadvantage no matter what.  In GO they changed that to make *more sense*™. The knife is the only weapon at a speed of 250 u/s. Grenades are slightly behind that with 245 u/s and pistols are at 240 u/s. Our not-so-trusty-anymore handcannon, the Deagle, is even slower at 230 u/s which is below some of the SMGs even.

Architecturally, a processor with Hyper-Threading Technology consists of two logical processors, each of which has its own processor architectural state 4 . After power-up and initialization, each logical processor can be individually halt- ed, interrupted or directed to execute a specified thread, independently from the other logical processor on the chip. Unlike a traditional dual processor (DP) configuration that uses two separate ph ysical processors (such as two Intel ® Xeon TM processors), the logical pr ocessors in a pr ocessor with Hyper-Threading Technology share the execu tion r esources of the processor core. These resources include the execution engine, the caches, the system-bus interface and the firmware.  ",®

t5_2snuc,Dudesan,1381107259,"&gt;This seems like a strange claim for the mod of a debate religion site to make. It's also self refuting.   &gt;The fact that you have made a statement criticising religion seems to disprove your thesis that religion enjoys protection from criticism.  Religious practices enjoy a certain amount of insulation, both from public criticism and from laws forbidding harmful practices. If a country's legislature decided that, for example, mutilating the genitals of infants was Bad Thing™ and should be illegal, you can expect religious groups to demand an exception on religious grounds, and you can expect that it will be granted.   In Canada, no one is going to come to my house and behead me for speaking out against such practices, but I can expect to be subject to substantial verbal abuse, not only from people who *actually hold* such positions, but also from people who merely sympathize with them.    I have been told, with a straight face, by an educated, white, deist, outspokenly feminist woman, that if some men in the middle east want to throw acid in the faces of daughters who ""dishonour"" them, well, that's just part of their culture and I have no right to criticize it.",™

t5_2rfxx,ezinc,1381110792,"The thing is that there is always going to be a winner and loser in every game, so someone not doing amazing is going to be inevitable. I don't understand why people get mad at someone for having a positive KDA.   I find that the higher your elo in ranked solo, the better the attitudes get. Now I'm not even Diamond (Plat I) but I don't get that many ragers anymore. Most of the time the person that is feeding owns up to his faults, apologizes, and nobody gets mad over it. Instead of whining, we will do something in-game like gank his lane or grab dragons/towers. Partly this is because people start to understand the game and grasp the concept that something as trivial as giving a kill or having the score be 0-5 does not mean it's ""GG"", and will play better instead of rage at the feeder.  The key (as the feeder) is to apologize and admit that you did something wrong. A lot of feeders blame others for their mistakes or genuinely believe they did nothing wrong, and I think that is where the bullying gets even worse. It's hard to get mad at someone who is apologizing profusely and takes all the blame, so maybe your brother can try that out if he isn't already.  The ragers your brother experiences are probably anomalies though because since he is new he is playing with smurfs of previously banned accounts, so tell him that it will get a little tiny bit better.  Anyway, what you summarized is basically why I don't rage at anybody ever in-game. Sure, I might whine in RaidCall® to my friends, but I don't straight up tell my team they are baddies. There is no point or goal to doing so other than making myself feel superior.   Tell your brother to mute the haters, apologize hard, or just get better at the game. Unfortunately, these are the only three options of dealing with this issue. League of Legends has a reputation for a toxic playerbase. After all, we have a massive playerbase and everyone comes from different family backgrounds and holds different values/morals.  You can't change other people, but you can change yourself.",®

My list is maybe irrelevant, it’s not necessarily the best but just what I love and want to share with you.    Let’s begin by current singers. The Rock in France Is pretty bad, like John Lennon said “The French Rock is like English Wine” ha ha !  But we have some interesting artists.

t5_2r497,FatSloth,1381156290,"Just going to post my basics on hon   **WARNING VERY LONG READ, BUT VERY HELPFUL FOR LoL TRANSFERS**  • Runes spawn every 2 minutes and comprise of invisibility, double damage, illusions (they do reduced damage and take extra damage), regeneration, and haste.  • Runes can be stored in an item called a Bottle. Bottles can store runes for up to two minutes, which can be used once at any time that the user wants. Think of a bottle as a storage unit for runes. Bottles also have a charge effect with a max of three charges. Each charge can be used to regen 135 hp and 90 mana (this is coming off the top of my head, I could be wrong) over 3 seconds which is dispelled when you take damage. The charges of a bottle can be restored by either returning to your well in spawn or by grabbing a rune/refreshment rune.  • Runes will spawn on one of the sides of the river, while the side that does not spawn a rune will spawn a pseudo rune called a Restoration rune. This rune does not give a full bottle, but 2 of the 3 charges and will give you the equivalent regen of a single bottle use if your bottle is full/you don't have a bottle.  • Running a solo hero in the long lane is referred to as the suicide role. By long lane I mean that if you are on hellbourne, your long lane is the bottom lane and top for legion. I could be wrong on if this is actually the long lane, but then again I am only human.  • The middle lane is typically given to heroes that heavily benefit from getting solo exp/farm similar to the role of mid in LoL. These heroes are typically very good gankers or can dominate mid game once they have specific items.  • Blink is replaced by an item that can be bought for 2150 gold called a Portal Key (hereafter referred to as PK). A PK has a longer cast range than blink and is a very common pick up on many heroes. Heroes that work best with a PK have either burst damage for quick picks, play the initiation role, or have an aoe disruption spell such as the two popular heroes engineer and pearl. PK has a 13 second cool down and will have a cooldown forced on to it when you take damage from an enemy. The cooldown will be set to 4 seconds. DoT spells will also cause this cooldown.  • Much like LoL you need to try and keep one of your eyes on the minimap and if you are used to it on the other side of your screen you are able to change the position of the minimap in the options section of the game. The icon to open the options should look like a cog in the top left of your screen. In my honest opinion, I believe that map awareness is even more important in HoN than it is in LoL as you can be picked off in a split second in HoN due to the abundance of 'cc' abilities and burst damage heroes as well as the buffed blink range of a PK.  • While the hero is considered to be a tad overpowered by a multitude of people, please refrain from trying the hero Monkey King until you get used to the fast paced gameplay of HoN. While he is deadly in the right hands, a new players hands will be far from right.  • There is a baron equivalent in HoN who is called Kongor. Defeating Kongor will give the killer 350 gold and his teammates 200 gold, but that is no the real prize. Killing Kongor has one amazing reward. On his first 2 deaths he will drop an item called a Token of Life. The Token of Life will revive the player holding it at the exact location that he died. They will be revived with full mana and hp, but their cooldowns will be the same as when they died. The hero that grabs the token of life can not give the item to other players and the token will expire after exactly 7 minutes. Token can be stolen by the opposing team, so it is typically quickly grabbed to avoid what is referred to as ""token sniping/stealing token"". Everytime that kongor dies after his first 2 deaths, he will drop bananas which is basically an instant heal item that heals for 2500 hp and 1000 mana and he will also continue to drop a Token of Life. Bananas can be sold in shop if you team truly feels that they do not need it as it will fetch a nice 500 gold for whoever sells it, but I would use it rather than selling it as it can sway a teamfight. Also, Kongor respawns exactly 10 minutes after he was killed and has no limit to the amount of times he can respawn.  • You can bind units to keys by holding down your CTRL + # on the top of your keyboard. So if I was to select a summoned minion(s) and hit ctrl + 1, everytime I hit my 1 key I would autoselect the minion(s). Minions can be added to old binds by holding SHIFT + the # you want them added to. I don't really want to go into an explanation of this as it is confusing enough in words already and it would only get worse if I included the explanation of adding units to binds.  • It is important to remember that HoN's gameplay is considered the most fast paced of the MOBA genre. Being out of a position can lead to an instant death and sway the next teamfight, potentially losing the game. While I do not want to dissuade you from trying new things, you need to try and be a team player rather than a solo ganker.  • Unlike in LoL, wards of sight will grant more vision when placed on an uphill area. Basically, the higher up a mountain you place a ward, the more vision it will typically grant. You can easily test this in practice mode. Counter wards are the same as in LoL and will show the area of invis sighting it will grant.  • When facing an invis hero, such as the popular hero Scout, try to make sure someone on your team has either a Bound Eye (this can be used for counterwarding, but will not be explaining that) or dust of revelation. Bound eye's leave up a constant AoE vision granter which will spot invis heroes/units that are in the AoE but are not in fog. Dust is a single time use AoE with 2 charges that have a cooldown. The AoE is a single use that will hit anything in the AoE and reveal them, even if they are in fog. I myself prefer a bound eye since it can be used for counterwarding. Bound eyes are dropped when the holder dies and can be destroyed or picked up.  • You want to try and avoid auto attacking lane as it will push your lane. Go for what is called last hitting where you only attack the creep once, but land the killing blow. I am not sure what percentile you are in LoL, so you might not have this mastered yet.  • Unlike in LoL, you can do what is called denying a creep. This is where you get a last hit on your own sides creeps which lowers the amount of exp it will give enemy heroes.  • You can stack creeps in the jungle by aggroing them at xx:55 on the game timer and pulling them out of their camp. You can have up to 3 jungle spawns in each camp, this includes ancients. Camp's can be blocked by placing a ward or standing in their spawn zone. Camps spawn every minute at xx:00. The first jungle spawn appears at 00:30.  • You can stack what is referred to as the pull camp to ""pull your lane"". Basically you drag creeps out of the jungle to aggro your lane units. This pushes your lane back to the tower so that you have better positioning. There is a number of guides for doing pull camps on youtube and I would advise watching one rather than asking me to type out an explanation. It is simply easier to understand when you see it.  • There are a number of roles in HoN, but it does lack a few of LoL's roles. There are carrys (no AD/AP), semicarrys, hard carrys (these three roles simply have limits to what items they go for, imagine a hard carry as mainly pure damage items without much survivability), tanks, initiators (pk is their best friend), supports, hard supports (goes mainly pure wards, bound eyes, rev wards, dust, and does not get many if any items), suicide, and jungle.  • Warding guides can be found at http://www.nigmanoname.com/prodex.html You will see at the bottom that they have a ward guide/glossary. Click that and you can click the ward icons to see an ingame picture of the exact ward spot. While this is not every good ward spot in HoN, it is a good collection. I do not advise you use the hero guides on this site as they are terribly out of date.  • Try to carry a TP at all times. Recall does not exist in HoN, we have to instead get an item called a Homecoming Stone. Refrain from getting one at the very beginning of the game, but try to carry one later in the game once the laning phase is nearing completion. TP costs 135 gold and has a 60 second cooldown. You can carry more than one TP.   Assuming you actually took the time to read all of that, I thank you for giving HoN a chance and if you feel the community is too toxic PM me on reddit and I can go on a 1500 acnt to see how you are doing. ♥",♥

t5_2tkq6,SanctumXVI,1381175722,"Like Seinfeld said earlier, your economy is of extreme importance when you are fighting against a meching player.  Because he already covered most of it, I'm just going to explain my thought process on dealing with mech.  Upon scouting mech at around the 8 minute mark (or seeing blue flame hellions earlier), I immediately react by taking a fourth base, starting a roach warren, AND starting a spire.  The only units I will make between the 8-12 minute mark are 12 mutalisks.  This is where I will contradict what he said: making mutalisks is a fantastic idea when fighting mech.  Why?  Not because they are efficient, but because they force thors.  While you are harassing with them, you are building up missile and carapace upgrades, and transitioning into mass swarmhost.  I also slowly sacrifice my mutas in the later part of the game to swap them with thors (only if I'm ahead, otherwise I make a ton of spine crawlers and use the extra supply for the corruptors).  TL;DR - Economy, mutalisk harass, mass swarmhost/corruptor.  Cheers ♥",♥

t5_2tkq6,SanctumXVI,1381176365,"I'll just answer this as systematically as you proposed the question.  **Against any gateway expand:**  15H (you will be 95% certain it's a gateway expand if you don't see a scout enter your base on 14 supply) 16G 16P Double Queen Speed @180G 2 Evo Chambers Start +1/+1 Melee and Carapace  NOW, this is where things are *dependent* on your scouting information.  If it's a stargate, I chance a third base and tech into a big ling/hydra attack.  If it's 3 gateways or a robo in the front, I get a baneling nest immediately after (that's how I stop all gateway attacks) and move into mass ling until he either A) attacks or B) takes a third base (in which case I'll attack said base).  **Against an FFE:** 15P 16H 21H (Drones, drones, 3 queens) @6:10 3 Gases  Again, if my overlord scouts a gateway attack, speed/baneling nest drops down, and I only put 5-8 drones on my third (and then make all units).  If it's a robo all in, I put mass spine crawler (16+ spines) at my natural, tech to muta, and counter attack for the win.  If no all-in: Lair Speed @7:30 3 Gases + Fourth Base Spire  In ZvP, I go mass muta corruptor against everything.  Against an FFE, I go mass M/C right away, and against a gateway expand, I use a ling/hydra attack to deny bases, lower unit count (particularly phoenix), THEN move into mass M/C.  I hope this book helped ^^ Cheers ♥",♥

t5_2tkq6,SanctumXVI,1381176543,"I made a post about mech a few minutes ago.  But here's the brief way to beat it relatively easily.  Drone and spread creep agressively, make about 12 mutalisks to buy you time for missle/carapace upgrades and mass swarmhost.  Go on the offensive with said swarmhosts (at this point you're on 4-5 bases) and tech into mass SH/corruptor to deal with the raven transition.  The mutalisks force thors/give you any and all map control, and the SH's decimate thors.  With this strategy, Terran should never be able to take a fourth, and eventually crumble to your composition/economy.  Cheers ♥  ",♥

The porn industry likes to hire men I jokingly refer to as ""distance cummers""- your mileage might (most likely will) vary, so don't worry about comparing yourself to porn stars. As for your friends, well, people will always exaggerate sexual encounters to make them sound more impressive. I wouldn't consider what they tell you to be realistic/accurate.  As for the physical aspect, if you're legitimately that concerned about it, I'm sure you could see a doctor.   Maybe you should change your technique? When an ex took my virginity, I was unaware of just how inaccurate porn was- I rarely masturbated, silly me- and didn't understand that penetration itself isn't usually enjoyable on our end. I read that most women climax from clitoral stimulation. He blamed me for not enjoying myself, and assumed I was at fault, not him. Then I masturbated- it was DEFINITELY not me!  Best wishes.

t5_2r9vp,huffmanm16,1381191726,"Hi, 18yo here to answer some question.   I've been smoking for 5 years this New Year's Eve. I'm not sure if that entitles long term smoking.   I have a job, I make 9 dollars an hour at a chipotle Mexican grill. It's hard, hard work and I absolutely love it. Every payday I spend 100 on marijuana (about 1/3 to 1/4 of my paycheck) for the next two weeks. I probably finish it in 5-7 days, and I don't buy any more until my next check. I've always been a ""slacker"" and a bit lazy, so I can't blame that on my smoking habits.   Smoking before I go about my day, and chores and such doesn't affect me much. I can handle being high and doing what needs to be done. I especially enjoy smoking a bowl and biking up to the gas station or drinks.   As far as the health risks, I would much rather smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes or drink. If your son is smoking cigarettes, help him quit. Marijuana has *virtually* no effects on your body. It still contains carcinogenic product because you're burning plant matter, but not nearly enough to cause respiratory problems over a long term period. If you want to know the healthiest way to enjoy the herb, look into helping your son get a vaporizer. Ask him about them to know more.   All in all, if your son wants to smoke a few times a week let him have some fun. Of course, as long as it's not effecting his educational life or his responsibilities. If you're seriously worried, help him balance fun and duties. Remember, balance is discipline.   Also, good on you for being open minded and not ignorant. It speaks a lot about you as a parent. 🍍",🍍

t5_2qh4u,MarsSpaceship,1381192585,"This article could be written by me in 2006 when I switched to a Mac and your comment could be written by me today... 😃  I still use Linux (CentOS) on all my servers. I never used Windows anymore. The problem with Linux is that it is a truck with 16 wheels each one pointing to one direction. The OS is designed to serve everybody and lacks refinement. The interface is changed every year and is awful. It is basically a windows interface with OSX touches... or in other words, a hybrid, or a fridge with a toaster if you will. Fortunately I only have to deal with SSH to my linux servers.   Another problem with Linux is this. They change radically everything internally every version. A driver for one version will not work on another and as soon as they release a new version, they drop entirely support for the previous versions. If you have installed a version from six months ago and a new one was released in this time frame, good luck find drivers in broken repositories. I had this problem many times, so don't tell me it is not like that.  If you ask me what system I do recommend for servers my answer will be Linux, probably CentOS. If you ask me what system I do recommend for humans, my answer is OSX.  If I think Macs are overpriced, not necessarily. I have seen PCs with the same level of hardware costing more. The problem with Macs is that you cannot do what you do with PCs, that is, by just one item (graphics card, disk, whatever). When you buy a mac you have to shell out all the money at once and this gives you the impression that you are paying a fortune. Obviously you can buy a computer for $25 today and you cannot compare that with Macs or you will die. Compare two computers with the same hardware quality and you will see they are not expensive. In some cases they are cheaper.",😃

I hope it was before my post, since I would feel like a dirtbag if my posting the picture incited anyone to deface/steal someone's property.

(I still don't understand how a *Christian* *Nation*™ executes people. (John 8:4 and all that.))  If I can just pick one little fight: Your priest is not asking a legitimate question with, “Tell me about this God you don’t believe in.”  Perhaps, he doesn't necessarily phrase it like that and I hope he doesn't, because when I see it asked, it's usually with some kind of rhetorical trap in the works. At this point you might be shaking your head in a Reagan-esque  manner saying, ""There you go again."" because I've superimposed my own prejudices onto the statement. I suppose this could be a request to start a dialogue, without any agenda behind it. I just think a meatier dialogue could be initiated with ""Why don't you believe in God?""    ",™

t5_2tkq6,SanctumXVI,1381200455,"I'll post a build order since you mentioned forgetting an upgrade (suggests to me you don't have a refined order):  15P 16H 15O 15Q 18G Scout With 2 Lings Speed Baneling Nest + Spine Crawler  Now, this is where ZvZ gets it's notoriety.  If you scout a ton of gas taken (compared to you), just speed gas taken, or a very early baneling nest, drop 2 more spine crawlers, and hold the ramp with queens.  If all is well, keep droning.  @6:00 2nd Gas + Evo Chamber @6:30 12+ Zerglings/+1 Carapace @7:00 3rd Base + Lair  The 12+ zerglings serve as pressure to not only keep units from attacking you, but to allow your third base to go up faster.  This is very crucial, as the +1 carapace will put your lair behind (so you need gas advantage).  @7:30 Double Gas Drone Third  At this point, I'm spreading creep, and making mass zergling to defend any small roach or ling attacks.  When +1 finishes, stop making zerglings and use the ones you have to aggressively deny mining on the third/snipe banelings ALL THE WHILE droning the gases on your third.  Spire +1 Carapace If Also Muta, +1 Missile if Roach.  You can either make 12 mutas, deny the third, and tech to roaches yourself with a superior economy OR make a ton of mutas, get baneling speed, and deny the first few attacks with this army while you tech to ultra on 4 base.  If they go muta, you go muta.  DONT TRANSITION.  I know this may be a bit of a change, but this opening is extremely safe against any all-in, gives you a ton of mobility/map control, and even allows you tech into roach (something you mentioned up top) with a better economy.  Hope this helps - Cheers ♥",♥

t5_2sbyc,without_name,1381200800,"Hard to come up with explicit examples. Perhaps it was unintentional, but bias/message shows up in a number of scenes--the obvious critique of factory farming, guised in the cloak of focus on life and death, the prefacing of the orthodox jews at the wailing wall with the border posts to remind you ""Hey, don't forget, Orthodox jews are largely responsible for the right wing elements of Israeli society that impose discriminatory laws and practices on the Palestinians."" Further, the slow-motion used in the wailing wall scene highlights the grotesqueness of the emotional display. No such negative imagery was presented before the baptisms (to my memory) nor before the muslim at prayer. The other religions were also presented in a largely positive light. The only white family/people in the film to do the slow motion stare-into-the-camera scene were all holding guns, and not only that, the father was inappropriately coached on the whole show-no-emotions thing and the daughter, who is the center of the piece, appears unhappy while holding her bright-pink Crickett rifle (Crickett® My First Rifle, the rifle company devoted exclusively to making child-size rifles, and who, apparently, are quite happy to paint your child's rifle pink if it'll make it more palatable to her feminine sensibilities). The manipulative nature of photography of the white people in the film, a culture I largely understand, instills in me a distrust of the truth regarding the photography of the cultures I do not intimately know.  Note that I am not saying that I believe an inaccurate portrait was painted of that particular family, just that there was a very clear message in choosing to paint a portrait of that particular family.  I watched it a couple of months ago or so, so my memory is a bit fuzzy; please forgive me if I am not entirely persuasive.  closest I could find to someone who agrees with me to some degree  http://thefilmcricket.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/samsara/  Edit: multiple typos",®

The SPLC is Zionist subterfuge  &amp;gt;http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center &amp;gt;&amp;gt;The Southern Poverty Law Center (abbreviated as the SPLC) is an extortion racket and Europhobic hate group, promoting cultural Marxism and Jewish supremacism located in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. The SPLC has two primary purposes; it serves as a business orientated, money-making scheme for millioner Morris Dees. Secondly, it acts as a propaganda vehicle to attack opponents of cultural Marxism and Jewish supremacism in the United States and is particularly engaged in a racial campaign against European Americans, their social, cultural, religious and economic interests, as well as their represented leaders. The means in which it propagates this is through the mobilisation of Freudo-Marxian newspeak, developed primarily by the Frankfurt School– known as political correctness.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;It is almost identical to other cultural Marxist and Jewish supremacist milieu groups, such as the ADL of B'nai B'rith and American Civil Liberties Union. The SPLC has tried to put across an ambiguous image to its de facto Jewish group interest nature. It was founded by Morris Dees and Joseph J Levin✡–the former a cosmopolitan mercenary accused in court of child molestation,[1] the latter a confirmed Jew. The current SPLC president J Richard Cohen✡ is also Jewish, as is its main media representative Mark Potok.✡ The SPLC have positioned themselves as enemies of freedom of thought, speech, association and empirical inquiry in the United States.",✡

They started off as a web development and security firm in the wonderful world of IT. They began to fund starting game sites and take shares in advertising revenue.  Ever since this was successful, Curse™ turned themselves into a company ""comprised of a number of gaming communities, tools, databases, videos, guides..."" etc  They now still provide ""tools"" to websites to help them ""run successfully"". Let's not forget they have an ESPORTS side to them too.  So now we have two sides of Curse.  Curse - Website dev Curse - Esports  The icon on the solomid.net site is reference that Curse is helping them run their site. Nothing else.  tl;dr : Curse is not just esports. TSM is in no way associated with Curse Esports.  Soon™",™

t5_2ykwz,i-am-you,1381246656,"So I had recently won a Kellogg's® sweepstakes and now I have a year's worth of cereal and milk (I receive shipments every week). I'm a college student, so Kellogg's® really helps save me money by paying for my breakfast everyday. In fact, I feel much more energetic and alert now that I have a garanteed breakfast for me every day. My grades have improved, I was offered several internships, and I go to the gym a lot more now. My life was turning around thanks to Kellogg's®.   My roommate was initially happy for me. He was happy that I could get my daily serving of whole grains from Kellogg's® themselves! (They are our favorite cereal company). However, as time passed by, he seemed started changing. He no longer wanted to eat breakfast with me, and one time I caught him eating cinnamon toast crunch (is it fulfulling or just full of sugar?). We used to be such great breakfast buddies, but I think he started to grow jealous of my never-ending supply of Kellogg's® cereal. I never said he couldn't share my treasure trove, so i'm not sure what happened to him.  A couple days ago, the Kellogg's® marketing department that ran the sweepstakes read an essay I sent them about potential viral advertising. They loved it and immediately offered me an entry level position. I was so happy, I decided to take my roommate and a couple buddies out to celebrate at Denny's®, when my roommate said he didn't feel well and he took a cab home. I was going to call him an hour later, but I couldn't find my phone, so I had to drive back. I come home to find my entire Froot Loops® stash all over the kitchen, with milk everywhere. My roommate looked like he was crying or something, and he came up to me to apologize for everything. He and his girlfriend had sex in my Kellogg's® cereal in my bathtub! I know a complete breakfast does wonders for your libido, but this is some kind of disgusting fetish! Not only that, he sent some pictures to my boss with my phone pretending it was me! Now i'm probably going to get fired, and perhaps my cereal supply line will be terminated. I haven't heard from him since.  TL;DR: my roommate is a fucking Kellogg's® lunatic",®

t5_2qwx3,Tak3n,1381252621,"There is a post on steam forums about the subject of why it is a different game (I guess they get asked it a lot)   A while back the developers were asked the same question. This was their response:  ""We got a lot of feedback on Combat Carnage from both gamers and press, allowing us to make vast improvements to the sequel, Gas Guzzlers Extreme.   1. We've made many new improvements and updates to our engine for the new Gas Guzzlers Extreme.  We have improved on the visuals and details by breathing more life into the cars by way of deeper car customization, new metallic paint jobs, more realistic car damage and visual effects, such as radial blurring of the wheels, better depth of field control and weather progression. We have also improved the handling and physics of all cars, along with added compatibility with a ton of steering wheel hardware, including the great Logitech G27 Steering Wheel.    2. The biggest feature, and the one we’re most excited about with in Extreme, is team-play in multiplayer.  Gas Guzzlers Extreme lets you play as a four-man team so you can now call on your friends to take on the streets together(4vs.4). You can also tag team with a friend, and battle up to 3 other teams (total of 8) - which is a first for vehicular combat games! Players can also customize their vehicles to match their team-mates, with custom paint, decals, and whatever else you want to represent. We ve also added some very fun &amp; humorous paint jobs to mimic famous brands, like Monstr ♥♥♥♥, Buttwasser, Lucky Smoke and Red Neck to name a few.   3. Along with team play, Gas GuzzlersExtreme gives the player eight multiplayer modes to play.  You can now play a Tournament, Classic Race, Battle Race, Power Race, Knockout, Death Match, Team Death Match, Last Man Standing, and Capture the Flag, and all modes are playable as a team. The modes that are traditionally ‘shooter’ modes are really quite fun with cars, and especially cars equipped with guns! We even added an announcer to boot that will call out the action as it happens. From the technical side, we’ve minimized network lag, and have created bots to keep the servers populated for race action anytime.   4. We have included 16 all-new tracks and arenas. These new tracks are complemented by the old favorites from Combat Carnage as a bonus.  5. The level progression in Gas Guzzlers Extreme will be a lot smoother  Players will be able to upgrade and customise their cars a lot quicker than in Combat Carnage, which was an issue with that game.  6. Steam integration Since Gas Guzzlers Extreme will be on Steam, we ve integrated a lot of Steam specific features, not only the online play tools, but other features such as Steam Achievements, Big Picture Mode, Cloud Saving and Steam trading Cards.  7. New single player campaign	 Last but not least, we revamped the single player campaign to be better balanced so that players will be able to quickly get into the game and experience the meat of the fun a lot faster.   Gas Guzzlers Extreme will entertain the classic racing fan and will even tie over the hardcore player who just want to blow stuff up, either in an arena or on a race track.""   ",♥

In general, I do love interacting with the community (frequently hop into any sort of voice comms I'm invited into) about the game and gathering feedback, participate in conversations both in-game and out, and this thread in particular sparked my interest as I wanted to make sure all of our communication channels are in line.   Beyond orchestrating communications, we also do a great deal of sentiment monitoring and analysis - I've said it before and I'll say it again: DICE and EA are always listening and documenting what you people **(YOU PEOPLE?!)** are saying and feeling. We partner heavily with folks like Crash7800 and a team of social reps to make sure we're always listening, learning, and adjusting accordingly.   It's also important to note that we, as the team who represent the community internally, are responsible for not only representing the vocal portion of the community, but the community as a **whole** - [while one person may be extremely passionate one way, oftentimes there's somebody else who isn't on Reddit or Facebook who feels the opposite way.](http://i.imgur.com/Mbd36XJ.png) which does make our job rather interesting some times.

t5_2qhk3,MRB2012,1381256628,"&gt;Our recent troll infestation—which was conducted, as many are, by trolls who wait until a Friday night because they know that the moderators, unlike themselves, are probably offline socializing and maybe even having sex—was an unpleasant reminder that a lot of the angry, entitled dudes described in the post blame feminism because they can’t get all the sex they think they deserve.  You're assuming that trolls actually believe what they're saying. They don't. They just know it will piss you off. You are feeding the trolls when you write articles like this. That only encourages them. The best way to deal with trolls is to ignore them.   &gt;The recent Facebook page threatening-by-pretending-not-to-threaten sex positive atheist blogger Miri Mogilevsky demonstrated a similar obsession. In particular, there was a weird obsession with Miri’s sex life, the usual “jokes” about how a woman who is sex positive must be fucking everyone (but the person angrily freaking out about this, of course) and the suggestion that the penalty for being sexually liberated, for a woman, should be death. (The page appears to be down now, but there was, unfortunately, the initial tendency to take the side of angry dudes over feminists in the Facebook response at first.*) The sexual resentment of Miri is particularly noteworthy in this case. Since her online presence is optimistic and cheerful, even the most aggressive protests that it’s about her personality are going to fall flat.  Trolls trolling an internet personality. Why should I care?   &gt;Per usual, I am perplexed by the entire hobby of freaking out on feminists because your own repulsive personality makes obtaining sexual attention difficult.   Feminists are self righteous idiots who write posts bitching about how mean trolls are. Smarter people ignore them. Feminists get trolled because they're appealing targets.   &gt;I get that feminists sometimes make an attractive target: Having been told your whole life by conservative forces that feminists are haggard man-haters who are bitter because they can’t get a man,  Have you seen pictures of Andrea Dworkin?   &gt;finding out how many are actually well-adjusted people who are certainly doing better in the sex department than you can be disconcerting.   Sure Amanda, you've got a crazy awesome sex life and bench press 300 pounds and have an IQ of 150 and you're just perfect.  I believe you. Honest.   &gt;However, that doesn’t make the feminist hate rational, and since so many of the haters clearly think of themselves as rational men here to tell the little ladies, the fact that they don’t even pause to consider how irrational it is to dump all their bitterness on feminists is particularly comical. Feminists aren’t the problem.   You've written a massive article whining about how mean trolls are. For a troll it is perfectly rational to attack you. You'll feed them. If you were smart you'd ignore them, but you're not so you don't.   &gt;Feminists aren’t plotting to keep the hot young women of OK Cupid from responding to your emails explaining that you are a Nice Guy® and if they don’t respond, it’s clearly because they, like most women, are shallow, money-grubbing bitches.   Young hot women don't use OK Cupid. They don't need to. Ugly women with no personality (also known as feminists) do.   &gt;It’s not like, prior to 1964, men were just assigned a woman and she had to be nice to him and have sex with him whenever he wanted, no matter what. Even then, women were free to notice that you are repulsive and unattractive and move on. In fact, because of the forced economic dependency that was created by the cult of housewifery, a lot of women put more emphasis on men having the money that the haters believe is the sole reason they aren’t elbow deep in 22-year-old pussy right now.    The haters are right. Being rich makes you more attractive. It's not PC to say, but it's true. Rich guys never have a shortage of willing young women. Are all women gold digging whores? No. But enough are that the small percentage of the male population to be truly wealthy will always have a few around.   &gt;Feminism, if anything, made it so that men who don’t necessarily have money but have other attributes—charm, good looks, a sense of humor, intelligence, all sorts of stuff—have more of a chance, because women are more free to follow their hearts if they pay their own bills.  You're assuming women will follow their own hearts instead of their wallets. And that their ""hearts"" lead them to smart, kind, funny men instead of serial killers (and given that hybristophilia is a thing, we can say that this is totally false for at least some women). You're assuming a lot of good things about female nature. Female humans are humans. Plan accordingly.   &gt;As I’ve pointed out over and over again while wielding the banhammer, if the haters took the time they spent hating feminists and creating threatening anti-feminist Facebook pages, and instead put that time towards self-improvement, they might actually find their sexual prospects brightening.  It takes about 10 seconds to write ""lol ugly dyke"" in the comments section for one of your articles. How many hours did you spend writing this? One? Two?   They owned you. They made you their bitch. And you're not even smart enough to realize it.   &gt;Probably not with 21-year-old club girls, but there are a lot of women out there! Simply not being a repulsive choad and take you a long way. But the message isn’t sinking it.  The expression is ""sinking in"" and the message you've sent with this article is simple. You're an idiot who feeds the trolls. Congratulations on making yourself a target. ",®

t5_2qq2q,icecreamnoms,1381259883,"Sorry this took so long! I've had a crazy few days :)   &gt; As far as the weather goes, I believe I've experienced a taste of true California heat. We actually just got home from California last Saturday and while we were there we visited Temecula for the second time and it was damn hot. Not as hot as the first time we were there, which was early November. We picked the brain of a lovely lady who worked at one of the vineyards who just happened to be a transplant herself and she told us about the ""June Gloom"" which sounds kind of interesting. Fogginess for 3 months...is that right?    -Yes! We have what’s affectionately referred to as “May Gray” and “June Gloom”. Basically it stays cloudy all day (except for maybe an hour or so of sunshine during midday). This can last into July sometimes. It isn’t a big deal, and doesn’t mean rain. It just means the marine layer can’t burn off. That being said, the closer you live to the beach, the more you will see this year round. Also, fog.    &gt; From everything she told us and from what you've described about the typical yearly weather, it doesn't sound like anything we couldn't handle. I found it to be a bit chilly in the morning but still nothing compared to a September morning in NY (45 degrees this morning). The afternoons and evenings were lovely. The times we've been to SD were March, early November and last week so we haven't experienced summer or winter there, but from what you've described it doesn't sound like there is too much deviation. I'm glad to hear you get rain storms though. Rain I would probably miss. 90+ degree summers with 60+% humidity...I will not miss that. -30 degree winters with 3+ foot snow/ice storms (when it's warm enough to snow)...won't miss that either.  &gt;   -It’s suppose to rain tomorrow and I’m equally excited (rain pitter pattering on window panes! Rejoice!) but also annoyed (no one in this city can drive in rain.) People don’t check their tires enough, so they get bald and with rain it will cause A LOT of accidents. Also, it will flood.    &gt;  &gt; How you describe the traffic is a bit disheartening. Of course, as a resident I'm sure you know better, but driving on the highway, I thought that the other drivers were pretty courteous and respectful, even in traffic. They actually let you merge and there weren't any maniacs weaving or giving you the finger. But maybe I was just in vacation-euphoria. But the slow thing - definitely agree with that. Driving and pretty much every other aspect of life seems much slower, but like you said, not in a bad way. Not something I think I would be annoyed by.   -I’m probably pretty biased because of where I work/live. I work in what’s called the “Golden Triangle” and it is the intermingling of I-5, I-805, and the 52. All are notoriously terrible rush hour roads. Most likely as a nurse, I guarantee you wont deal with rush hour the way most of us do.   &gt;  As for our jobs - I noticed some hospital/medical centers being built while we were there...so that's encouraging. I have many (too many) years experience in psych so I hope finding a job won't be too hard for me, but my boyfriend is a mechanic. The problem is that he actually makes very good money here, but he hates it. Hates the work and doesn't want to do it anymore. He wants to get into the music industry somehow. He's not even sure what he wants to do, but he loves playing the guitar and he would like to perhaps get into making/designing them. Basically he really doesn't know, but if he has to take a job at an auto shop he will, if the money is decent.  &gt;   -This I am 100% unsure about! Haha sorry! I don’t know much about the music scene out here. There are a lot of bars that do open karaoke nights etc, so that could help him get his foot in the door!  &gt; We are currently living in a condo that is underwater and as soon as we can figure out a way to sell it and not take a gigantic loss, we're out of here. I believe I've heard that a typical 1-2 bedroom apartment might go for around $1500 a month. Of course I realize it varies depending on the town/area, but if that is in fact a fair estimate, that would be amazing. You can't touch anything around here for under $2000...and that's usually a studio. We are pretty open as far as what town we decide on. I've heard that La Jolla is rather expensive as well as Del Mar, so we've spent most of our time a bit north. I guess we're hoping it's like Westchester - the further north you go, the less expensive it gets...until you hit Orange County. Is this generally true or do I just have wishful thinking? &gt;   -Unfortunately, I don’t think it is like Westchester in that sense. More like, the further east you go, the cheaper it is. North County near the water is Lo Hud-like prices (think Scarsdale/Rye) and then once you go further inland you’ll start to see the drop (Port Chester). Anywhere in between you are probably looking at a decent apartment price in the White Plains area.   1-2 bedroom for $1500 is about right. Very nice, new apartments that have granite countertops and stainless steel appliances will set you back closer to $2000. Check out [padmapper.com](https://www.padmapper.com/search/apartments/California/san-diego/) . Your other option is going south of downtown. There are a lot of medical operations down in Chula Vista-area. It isn’t the nicest place, but it also isn’t the worst (providing you pick the right area of Chula Vista). But it will definitely be pretty cheap.   &gt; As for activities, we're not really party/bar scene people, but Temecula is right up our alley.  &gt;  -There are a lot of outdoors things to do! Definitely check out Julian, CA. Also, if you dare, you can go south of the border to any of the beach towns (Ensenada/ Rosarito). Ensenada is the wine capital of Mexico, and both places have a healthy seafood-appreciation. Also, there are bunch of cruises that leave from SD. San Diego County is fairly diverse, they have 2 Ren Faires, and a Viking Festival to demonstrate. Also, multiple  Oktoberfests, Day of the Dead celebrations, etc. And they all have a different feel. Some are more family-friendly, some are more college-friendly. Lots of outdoorsy things also. Rock climbing, Hiking, Surfing, Paddleboarding, Snorkling with fish, etc. The beaches are hit or miss… it sounds like you may have skimped on most of the crowds though! The good news is, there are so many beaches that you are usually fine. Very warm weekends and holiday weekends it will be busier. One of my favorite beaches is Solana Beach! Also, these are all things I do throughout the year ☺ no more 4 month windows! Also, there are quite a few Casinos in SD County. Harrah’s, Barona, etc. there are a few ☺  &gt; Do you find that you miss anything about home that San Diego can't make up for?  &gt;  -Nothing you wouldn’t expect to miss anywhere else. Food, Family, Friends etc. I do miss the weather/seasons. I don’t snowboard or ski, so going to the mountains to get my snow fill isn’t as appealing to me as it would be to have mint hot cocoa and stroll through the snow. But c’est la vie! The Pizza is comparable, the Bagels are OK, but the Chinese food sucks. Thai places have better fried rice than most Chinese places. It's strange. They make up for it in Mexican Restaurants :) I think theres a better sense of creativity in dining out here than in Westchester. Chefs are more likely to mix and mingle different types of cuisines.   &gt; We don't plan on leaving and never coming back to visit, and as much as we love it there and definitely want to move there, the prospect of packing up our lives and moving across the country is a bit daunting. We often ask ourselves if it's possible that we get there, land jobs and a place to live and find that we hate it. I'm sure that's always a possibility, and the risk of homesickness aside, we are looking to move somewhere bigger, better and prettier with nicer people, nicer weather and a more laid back atmosphere. I can't think of a place that better fits that description than the San Diego area so basically we're just hoping that we aren't chasing some unattainable dream and that the metaphorical grass is actually greener. It really is magical aout there. &gt;  -Don't kid yourselves, it is daunting! BUT with enough prep work, you should be fine. Also, it will relieve a lot of stress if you can secure job interviews (even better if they are offers) before you move out here. The less you have securing you down, the easier it will be. That being said, as you get older, I think it definitely gets harder/scarier to give up your comfort zone. When I moved, I had just graduated college and was pretty invincible. The reality of my gamble has only really set in in the last year or so, and I probably wouldn't blindly move across the country with nothing but suitcase again. That being said, it is important to remember that you can always move back. :)  Let me know what else you have questions on, and I will try to come up with more timely answers :) ",☺

The the usual features (cookies, javascript, etc) are erratic. Also, the screen is small, and you can feel that a lot.  However, as usual inputing text is very time consuming. And you have to often adjust the zoom level, which forces a slow redraw.  So yes, browsing reddit can be done with the Aura HD, but don't expect to be able to use it seriously.

Bolded text is mine for emphasis.  http://www.guildwars.com/events/press/releases/pressrelease-2003-04-22.php &gt; 	 &gt; &gt;Press Release - April 22, 2003 &gt; &gt;NCSOFT UNVEILS ARENANET’S HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED COMPETITIVE ROLE PLAYING GAME, GUILD WARS &gt; &gt; From the key developers behind Blizzard’s mega successes, Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo, Guild Wars will make its debut at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo &gt; &gt;SEOUL, South Korea/SEATTLE, WA, April 22, 2003 -- NCsoft, the world's top developer of online computer games is pleased to announce Guild Wars™, a **mission-based competitive online role playing game**, produced by its Seattle-based ArenaNet studio. Guild Wars will have its first major public showing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), May 14-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. &gt; &gt;**In the fantasy world of Guild Wars, players can engage in cooperative group combat, in single player adventures, or in large head-to-head guild battles.** Guild Wars is a game that will constantly evolve, using streaming technology to provide players with the latest updates while they’re online. In addition, gamers will be able to play Guild Wars without a monthly fee in North America. NCsoft will announce a variety of pricing options for gamers in other parts of the world in the near future. &gt; &gt;""We're excited to unveil Guild Wars,"" said Patrick Wyatt, the original producer and lead programmer for the Warcraft series. ""We believe that players are going to enjoy experiencing a game that offers technological advances that fundamentally improve the online role-playing experience, and the introduction of a groundbreaking business model for the genre."" &gt; &gt;ArenaNet was founded by key members of the creative teams behind the hit game series Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo, as well as Battle.net, one of the most successful gaming networks in the world. &gt; &gt;The game is mission-based, and while each combat experience will be different, achievements will be permanent, so that each character grows and progresses over time. Unique items, special abilities, and a wide variety of skills will add meaningful value for the players. Missions are not scripted adventures, but are tactical battlegrounds where victory or loss is determined by skill and teamwork. &gt; &gt;Mike O'Brien, the creator and architect of Battle.net, points out ""Our vision has been to create a game that rewards skill and inventiveness rather than hundreds of hours of play, so we've built Guild Wars from the ground up to be a balanced environment where players of all skill levels can compete for recognition and prizes."" &gt; &gt;Key Game Features &gt; &gt; * **Join in cooperative quests or unite in head-to-head guild battles.** &gt;  &gt; * Develop a unique character who can explore multiple professions and choose from hundreds of unique skills. &gt;   &gt; * **Enjoy fully-integrated support for guilds, including worldwide tournaments and ladders, guildhalls, special character identification and forums directly built into the game.** &gt; &gt; * Experience a changing world, where the entire landscape can be altered as you explore and conquer. &gt;  &gt; * Play in a secure server-hosted game environment that prevents cheating; ArenaNet's technology allows quick and seamless resolution of exploits. &gt; &gt;Guild Wars is expected to launch in the 2nd Half of 2004. Many additional details about Guild Wars may be found at the game site: www.guildwars.com.  EDIT: Before you say how it also talks about PvE and single-player and whatever (actually it really doesn't talk about the story at all), I would like to point out that the guild wars themselves play a very minor role in the plot of the game. It's clearly not a first choice for a title if you're going to name something after the story. ",™

I'm going to guess the admins are pressuring you even though they would never do this to SRS, because you'd never do anything like this if the admins didn't tell you to.  **This is really fucking stupid, because the whole value in SRSSucks is being a counter-brigade to SRS's backward ideology.** This basically means that SRS will be allowed to make their pseudoscientific ideology dominant on any subreddit while anyone who opposes SRS can't do shit about it.  tl;dr agree with SRS's definitions of rape/racism, theories on objectification and the effect that slurs/pejoratives have on the brain OR ELSE      13 comments     share  all 13 comments sorted by: best  [–]BestMan 3 points 4 hours ago  To be honest, I think the blatantly biased admins pulled most of SRSSucks' teeth a while ago, not you mods fault, but still.

The sub has been neutered beyond repair at this point. The mods should just say ""fuck it"" and tell everyone there that anything goes until the admins ban the sub. At least go out with a bang.      permalink  [–]MittRomneysCampaign[S] 4 points 4 hours ago  otoh where would you refute half of the dumb shit SRS says?  like they spread that ""we're anti-racist and the only people who are against us are racists"" bullshit across the whole website. where else would you say how untrue that is?      permalink     parent  [–]xinebriated2 4 points 3 hours ago  SRSS needs new mods fuck them they are a bunch of faggots implementing rules because one admin suggested it. no one made them do it they are getting trolled hard by SRS/intortus right now. they are so scared of being SBd or getting the sub banned they have totally lost their balls.      permalink     parent  [–]Puck_Marin 2 points 3 hours ago  That's essentially what I was saying. Time to clean house.  Why would you want to be part of a sub where you have to jump through a ton of hoops to post anything to begin with?      permalink     parent  [–]Laurelais-Hygiene 1 point 45 minutes ago  It's too late. SRSs is already dead. It used to have a window with potential about a year ago but the admins have entered the meta-reddit scene with their neutering device and cut off most of the non-SRS subs their balls.  SRD is still incredibly anti-SRS though, but the mods there are trying to do anything to influence this.  Ddxxdd was always an old skool a-srser who was more interested in discussing SRS than doing anything about it, he was never really fit to lead the SRSsuckers who mostly consisted of pissed off randoms.      permalink     parent  [–]Puck_Marin 2 points 3 hours ago      otoh where would you refute half of the dumb shit SRS says?  I think you burn SRSSucks to the ground and start over elsewhere. The sub is fucked as it is and no amount of new rules will change that so you let it go out in a blaze of glory, wait a week or two and start over with mostly new mods, etc...  What I don't understand is the kneejerk reaction that the SRSSucks mods always have when someone gets banned. ""Oh no! A few of our users (or in this case one of the mods) got banned. We better institute more rules.""

t5_2qh33,jubbergun,1381297503,"&gt; All I have to do to convince myself that we live in a patriarchy is to go watch a Hollywood film...  There are more than a few movies that focus on women as the primary characters or are female fantasies.  Everything from *Under the Tuscan Sun* to *Eat, Pray, Love* is practically its own genre.  Don't even get me started on the unrealistic rom-coms and other silliness women go to in droves wherein your asserted ""women are only two-dimensional characters that round out the man"" is fully reversed in the opposing direction.    Not every movie is a Michael Baysplosion of guns and testosterone.  Even when they are and a female character is in play, individuals like yourself write off strong female leads like Scarlet Johannson playing a well-rounded (clearly superior to some of her male counterparts) character as a ""token.""  The Black Widow character out-witted one of mythologies most well-known trickster gods, and to you she's a ""cardboard-cutout.""  The fact that you think every post that disagrees with the myopic view of the world that feeds your martyr complex is ""misogynistic"" and that it's somehow fed by this secret, unspoken agreement that we're all unknowingly party to is classic conspiracy nonsense at best and paranoid delusion at worst.  Just look at your view of Scumbag Stacy memes.  I can't remember the last time I saw one about blowjobs.  When they are about blowjobs/sex, it's generally not about a lack of blowjobs, it's about the abundance of blowjobs and how they're being given to people outside the relationship to which the Scumbag Stacy is allegedly committed.    Now, you could change your mind about what's wrong with the Scumbag Stacy meme and say it was ""slut shaming"" (another ridiculous idea from an overflowing fountain of absurdity) because people are deriding the Scumbag Stacy for her sexuality, but you'd still be wrong.  It's not the sex that's usually wrong in the Scumbag Stacy memes when sex is involved, it's the breach of trust involved, the cheating, the lying, and the double-standards.  None of those things are specifically female characteristics, but individuals like yourself, likely on the hunt for things about which to be offended, pitch a fit when the foibles being examined belong to anyone without a penis.  You can say you don't believe it's a conspiracy all you like, but your words betray you.  At least if you believed we were snorting coke off a hooker's ass at our weekly Patriachy!™ Meetings while planning ways to further oppress you we'd be able to take you along while we snorted coke off a hooker's ass to show you all that we were really doing wrong was feeding our terrible addiction and enabling poor Dakota to do the same.  Unfortunately, you've dreamed up this weird gestalt mind-link that we're all unknowingly (except for you and a few chosen others...classic paranoia/conspiracy thinking) party to that, much like God, we have no way to prove or disprove exists.  Under those conditions, you get to be right no matter what, and we're all the crazy ones because we're missing the obvious signs of ~~the lizard people taking over~~ the global Patriarchal Hegemony, or whatever the fuck you're calling it this week.  TL;DR: You're a delusional loon, just like all the other shrill harpies shrieking about this imagined secret oppression club set up by men for the benefit of men.",™

But I'd just say ""eww, don't do that"". That's definitely not a common deal-breaker. Contrary to popular belief, men are not clairvoyant. Your date cannot magically tell what you like, so you'll have to tell him what you like and what you don't. - Completely different social groups / interests: Acceptable deal-breaker. - Smokes: More than acceptable deal-breaker. - he tips poorly: Neutral on this; probably you live in the Land™ of the Free™ where waiters don't get paid so they have to resort to charity. - Lacks ambition and/or motivation: Acceptable deal-breaker. - Isn't intelligent: More than acceptable. - Is smaller than me: Never understood why people impose these kinds of limits, but oh well. - Is over the top religious, or has views the polar opposite of mine on certain social issues: More than acceptable deal-breaker. I'd hardly date a non-atheist.  So, answering your question: is that an unreasonable list? It is reasonable, at least to me. I have a similar number of deal-breakers and preferences.  I'm not a fan of the expectations on height or weight, but a lot of women have them, so they can't claim you're alone on this.

I personally haven't had much luck with Dell over the last few years, after being a big fan, so I can't speak as to it's internals' compatibility with *nix platforms, namely Ubuntu, but the Asus X models I use and have recommended friends/clients have all been plug and play with Ubuntu.   I travel a lot and do development work, the [X501](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/X501A/) **(Specs: Core i3, 4GB (upgraded to 8GB), Intel® HM76/HM70 Express Chipset, 15.6"" HD (1366x768) LED Backlight, 500GB 5400rpm, card reader, web camera, 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth)**  Is honestly the best laptop I have owned. Mind you it is not a high end Ultrabook, but due to it's design, primarily the fact that it opts out of carrying an optical drive, which is a winner in my book, it's quite svelte and easy to carry with one hand. The battery performs quite well, especially if you adjust the brightness and power settings. I run several flavors of Ubuntu currently [Elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/) on one and [PinguyOS](http://pinguyos.com/) on the other.   Running several browsers with multiple tabs, at least one VirtualBox VM and local terminals/ssh windows and the thing doesn't even stutter.   Yes, I could have spent more, but why. I actually bought this on a whim one day while at BestBuy, they had these on sale for $349 and I thought, yeah, I'll buy it, play with it over the weekend an return it, I used a Thinkpad at the time for my primary laptop and wasn't really looking for a new one. After loading up Ubuntu and finding that all of the devices where recognized right off the bat was a good feeling and the ride just kept getting better from there. This model has become my primary laptop and it continues to serve we well on a daily basis.",®

Even without that info, it'd be stupidly easy for SE to put a simple server-side check and catch people when your character starts sprinting across the map at ludicrous speed™.  All it has to do is check for the movement delta which you'd immediately fail regardless of system clock tampering because *you can't move that fast, ever*.  Also, as someone who used to use the hack (in my defense, I only used it to farm that one ENM item with the mountain puzzle in Attohwa, because fuck running up that thing for 45 minutes), you could also move in the Z direction, which has absolutely nothing to do with clock desync as you suggested.

t5_2rnve,spades1112,1381339882,"So after much thinking, I decided to change my build. I will still go with gigabyte, but there server board, which come with a wifi card so I removed the one I had. I got rid of the thermal paste since Seidon comes with it. Im going to go with a Xeon CPU for reliability and can take advantage of the ecc. [which the motherboard is compatible] I changed the memory to 8gb server memory that supports ecc. I cant overclock this xeon so that not an option, and decided that going dual if i cant afford both cpus together was not really a good decision. As for this CPU I decided to go with the E5-1650 [if I can get it] as it has basically the same spec as the I7-4930k [just .1ghz less]. If I cant get it, I was looking at the E5-2630 but it was 100$ more with less speed. Went with a mechanical keyboard, Cherry MX brown. Last thing I had to do was to switch the case so i could fit the new motherboard. All in all, it's slightly more expensive cause it's full workstation quality, but I think that will translate in to a much more efficient build for my use. Please let me know what you guys think.

t5_2qhwp,Inacio_,1381361078,"• Great worldbuilding. Morrowind was incredibly immersive, not because of its normal maps and blooms, but because it was deep, full of details and varied. Skyrim was bland, repetitive and boring in comparison.  • Spellmaking and enchanting, again, like Morrowind.  • Oblivion-level quests. Oblivion had several memorable quests, more so than Morrowind and Skyrim. There's a quest to save an artist who gets trapped by paint trolls inside his painting, there's one where you have to get into a party and kill everyone without being found out. Another one you use a spell to make everyone in a house get naked. It's great.  • Some better house management stuff. Owning a house in Oblivion / Skyrim is really boring. Hearthfire made it slightly better, but not much - some mods did it better than the DLC. Maybe something like upgrading your house in a more meaningful way, or breeding horses or something.  • **An actual new god damn engine**. We know ~CreationEngine­™(c) ~ is actually still Gamebryo, Bethesda. We care. Stop. It's buggy as fuck and really limited.  • Modding support. One of the best features in the TES games, and has to stay. Make it better, if possible.  • More equipment variety. Having 8 types of materials is not enough, imo. And having more than 2 types of swords would be cool, too!  • More depth to skills. If things keep going the way they are we're gonna have just HP/MP, Damage and Defense as TES6's skills. Morrowind was too much, but Oblivion was the sweet spot for me.  • More voice actors. Much more. It's really immersion breaking when a noble sounds the same as a beggar. Possibly with the same lines.  • Rebalance *everything*: Skyrim feels like it's more of an action game than a RPG. Sneaking is weird and unreliable, the game sometimes feels repetitive when you play a traditional sword+shield character even though the game appears to be centered in this playstyle, archery is often underpowered, aswell as magic, lots of perks are *very* specific and probably aren't picked too often... there's a lot of things about the gameplay in Skyrim that while I can't quite point out what don't feel too right.  • Birth signs and custom classes  • More open world. Less loading doors / screens, less walled cities, more fun.",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1381365204,"it's time for **RageChat™**  I really like this comic, and the main reason behind that is that it does a great job of using First-Wave Rage sensibilities on a RageFace™ that became marginalised during the Second Wave.  Forever Alone has been diluted over time due to significantly increased usage, and these days the face is just as likely to appear in a comic that has nothing to do with loneliness as one where that is the central theme. Additionally, the threshold for Forever Alone status has dropped a lot since the seminal days and the words have been devalued because at this point only getting 3 likes on a Facebook status is enough to justify the title. (If any of you found yourselves immediately disliking this RageComic™ this is probably why: we've got a negative bias against it these days due to its misuse).   This is a sharp &amp; concise piece of work that shows an often underappreciated aspect of living life when truly Forever Alone: that the world has certain expectations of you, and you have failed to meet them. Most single people will see something like this and feel temporarily saddened, but it won't last long; after all, they're not so socially inept that a partner is out-of-reach for them if they put the effort in.  Not the Forever Alone though. They legitimately feel like their relationship status is something they have no control over, because expending effort isn't enough for them due to their lack of sexual market value. They've tried and failed, so they know that simply trying won't work for them. This can serves to remind these people that there is something *wrong* with them, and that's got to sting.  For a 2-panel comic that amounts to little more than a copy/paste job, this really has the ability to dredge up some interesting thoughts. This has increasingly become a rarity in RageComics™, even with the explosive growth of the Third Wave movement which promised so much in the way of introspection &amp; analysis and has as-yet delivered so little. It's telling that a return to the more direct nature of the First Wave here has delivered some true insight into the human condition. The original RageArtists™ - long since gone - showed us that emotional depth doesn't require complexity, and it would behoove a lot of fledging Artists out there to keep this in mind.  **RageScore™**: 90  **RageChoice™ Nominee, October 2013**  ***RageBulletin™!!!***  RageChat™ has found a new home over at /r/RageChatInc, the new subreddit for RageChat™ Incorporated.

t5_2quts,thehippykid,1381366200,"I got this Naruto vs Goku-   All the two could remember was a flash of light and the sudden urge to fight to the death filled their minds. They were standing opposite each other, both knowing that they must display the power they have acquired over their lifetimes of hardships.  There is a faint breeze. Goku is happy to fight with a worthy opponent and Naruto is eager to test out some of his new abilities with Kurama. Kurama warns Naruto, ""This guy... I don't like him. It's a shame I have to waste some of my power to help you fight him"". Naruto smiled, glad that his fuzzy friend was willing to help.  Naruto and Goku continued staring at one another waiting for some imaginary announcer to announce the beginning of their fight. They could feel thousands of anime-loving eyes absorbing every detail of the fight to end all fights. Finally, the argument over who is best anime protagonist would be over and the ultimate crossover would finally occur.  The two smiled at each other, and the breeze ended, marking the start of the fight of the century. In that instant, Naruto had devised an elaborate sequence of moves that would lead his opponent towards the rubble, once there, two hidden shadow clones would distract his adversary while his real self created the first universal rasengan™. The plan was foolproof!  Back in reality, the two set there fighting stances and took deep breathes. However, Goku suddenly felt the uncontrollable urge to sneeze and told Naruto that he needed a second to sneeze. Naruto, being the nice protagonist, urged him to do it quickly, wanting to start the fight.  Impressed by his adversary's politeness, Goku let loose the worst sneeze he ever had. The powerful blast slammed against Naruto and his body was ripped to pieces, along with the surrounding area, and in one instant the greatest, ultimate, final anime crossover battle ever was over.  Honestly, this has been said many times, DBZ characters could annihilate entire anime universes in a second.   Characters that can blow up planets&gt; Characters that can blow up villages   ",™

Saying   &gt; With the PS Vita system, gamers will be able to play a range of PS4™ titles on the beautiful 5-inch display over Wi-Fi access points in a local area network.

Once one game is finished I pick another one to add so that I always have 3 games active. When I get bored/frustrated I jump to the next game and keep hacking away. Currently I have just finished Alan Wake (awesome!) and Serious Sam 3 (not quite as awesome), and Rage, Zombie Shooter 2 and L.A. Noire are the active games at the moment.  How I get the time; I game on a schedule, mostly in 1-2 hour sessions when my wife goes out shopping or early on saturday mornings before she is out of bed. I also usually get that 1-2 hour session before bedtime, as my wife likes to watch TV at that time. Oh, and I almost don't watch TV or movies, maybe 2 hours a week at tops.  How much the games cost; I usually buy when there are sales (this years summer sales I bought about 100 games), which means that the cost isn't all that. Accumulated over time of course I could have bought me something else instead, but I wouldn't have traded in my game time with anything. There are quite a few games out there though that are just too expensive for me, but with price drops and sales I'll eventually get to try them out. And no, I have no idea what my Steam account is worth, and a steam calculator website won't help, since that doesn't reflect previous sales prices.  How I finish multiplayer games; in short, I don't. Unfortunately there is no way for me to filter out the multiplayer games when creating the list without some heavy editing. Since many multiplayer games frequently gets updated then its a losing battle, although my main motivation for not attacking it head on (odds stacked against me motivates me) is basically that I like games with a story arch.  How I consider a game finished; when the credits starts to roll, basically. That doesn't mean that I rush through games though. Games like Oblivion and Saints Row 2 was gigantic time sinks, but in a good way. I don't simply play through all these games just to ""have played through all these games"", I am looking for those special games that makes me yearn to play more. I do rush through games that I consider bad though, partly in the hope of it getting better (which rarely happens when you rush through it though) and partly because I want to see it through.  Writing reviews; I got a couple of requests about writing reviews and I actually started on it. However I found that it was more time consuming then I thought, even for a quick review (I had problems shortening them). Maybe I'll do something like that somewhere down the road (when I've finished 1000 games?) but until then I'm sorry but it didn't work out. Feel free to ask me about any game I've finished though.  Marking games as finished in your Steam list; this was done in Photoshop, it is not possible to do in Steam itself. I wish it was though. Instead what I do is to create a category called ""Finished"" and add them there.",®

t5_2qh1i,MarsSpaceship,1381398374,"1. NASA uses public money and build things like Hubble telescope and other toys that the public don't have access. I suggest opening the minds and the tools to the public. What I mean is this: why not giving the public (amateur astronomers and or/any interested person) access to get ""live"" feed from Hubble and other toys? You can limit a quote of X hours per month to public access using a web interface/app and always provide the live feed of whatever the Hubble is seeing that is being used by an astronomer at that time. You guys close everything from public but when you need us to increase your budgets you don't have the shame to ask. So, open all toys to public. I know the hubble requires a software to decode feed and assemble the image. Provide that tool and a live feed. 2. There are a lot of conspiracy theories and bull crap on the web, about bases on the moon, whatever. I know NASA will not stop those conspiracies but when some theory develops about a base on the moon at a certain point, NASA could provide hires pictures of that point to prove there is nothing there beyond rocks etc... unless you guys are covering up something... 😃 3.

There are some good things, like a stable job and not moving back in / living with my parents. But unfortunately I live with some very messy people, and have to act like an adult and teach them how to do things like clean the kitchen or their rooms. Its really upsetting that I have to put up with their shit, but I don't make enough to live on my own.  I know most people would be psyched to have a stable job, but I'm being taken advantage of and not paid market value for the skills I bring to the table. I've interviewed for other jobs but got turned down because I'm not good enough to run with the Big Dogs™. Don't get me wrong, I'm good at what I do... but there is certainly room for improvement.  It's hard to set aside my anger about my job situation, to come home after work every day and work MORE to improve myself. It made it a lot easier to smoke a bowl, relax for a few minutes, and then hop back on the computer and start working on my own personal projects.  So yea... things will get better... eventually.",™

t5_2sokd,slendrman,1381424179,"I always understood the answer to this is at the cellular level, and according to the [national institute of general medical sciences](http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/insidethecell/chapter5.html#1), it does have to do with the degradation of cells:  &gt; Most scientists now agree that aging is, at least in part, the result of accumulating damage to the molecules—such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)—that make up our cells. If enough molecules are damaged, our cells will function less well, our tissues and organs will begin to deteriorate, and eventually, our health will decline. So in many respects, we appear to age much like a car does: Our parts start to wear out, and we gradually lose the ability to function.  Basically, parts of your cells become severely damaged (a large part of this is due to the way your body uses oxygen), and they cannot perform the basic tasks of cells (creating energy, waste management), and your organs cease to function.  In regards to reversing this type of entropy, I remember seeing a *Nova™* episode on how scientists are currently working on reversing this natural process. ",™

t5_2snuc,culpepper,1381429132,"&gt;As far as I understand, a person who considers themselves agnostic is one who may or may not believe in a higher entity (somewhere on a range of probabilities &gt;0 and &lt;100) but claims that they cannot *know* for certain.  Is this incorrect?Within the realm of deities, you are correct. However, your question implies, at least to me, that you are attributing their agnostic beliefs towards a god and applying it to the rest of the universe, which would be incorrect.&gt;So, I'm specifically referring to those agnostics who are very close to the 0 side for probability of a higher entity, but still choose not to call themselves atheist.  I'm asking them whether they are 100% sure of any fact (including shoes, cars, love, or anything really).This is where your question breaks down, because whether someone is agnostic about gods has no bearing on whether they are agnostic about anything else.Further more, agnostic and atheist are not mutually exclusive terms. You can be both.&gt;If you consider yourself within this class of agnostic, could you give me an example of a fact that you are 100% sure you know?(I'm not exactly because, you can be both agnostic and atheistic, I'll answer, maybe it will help you anyway.)

t5_2qlit,JalapenoTampon,1381430834,"By Julie Deardorff, Chicago Tribune reporter October 10, 2013  Like many runners, Brian Tolsma worries that once he starts feeling thirsty during a hard workout, he's in trouble: His body has started to break down.  That's why Tolsma will force down as much water as possible on the day before Sunday's Bank of America Chicago Marathon. During the 26.2-mile journey, he plans to be even more methodical: ""I'll likely stop at all 20 water stations, taking in at least a cup of fluid at each one, whether I'm thirsty or not,"" said Tolsma, 34.  Drinking ""ahead of thirst"" is a common hydration strategy that was widely encouraged for years. But many experts in exercise science advocate a simpler and surprisingly controversial method: Trust in your thirst, and drink water when the urge hits.  The supposed dangers of dehydration — such as heat illness and cramps — have been overblown, these scientists allege, a problem some blame on the sports drink industry. They say water loss is a natural consequence of exercise and is far less dangerous than overconsumption, which in extreme cases can cause serious illness and death.  Ingesting too many fluids can lower the blood's sodium levels enough that cells start to swell, a potentially dangerous condition called hyponatremia. When 43-year-old runner Kelly Barrett died after the 1998 Chicago Marathon, a doctor who treated her said swelling in her brain caused her to go into cardiac arrest. Relatives said Barrett had been drinking vast amounts of water.  Among marathon runners, the incidence of hyponatremia may be as high as 13 percent, according to one published study that looked at Boston Marathon participants.  By contrast, most marathoners are probably somewhat dehydrated, but that doesn't matter much, scientists say. Dehydration is unlikely to cause problems unless a thirsty person is deprived of fluids for a long time — not likely during a marathon where unlimited water is available.  Athletes also may think that aggressive hydration will help them avoid heat illness and cramping. But experts say hydration plays only a minor role in the root cause of heat illness — body temperature — and cramping is likely caused by neuromuscular fatigue. ""Hitting the wall,"" meanwhile, happens when muscle cells run out of glycogen, which is the fuel stored inside the cell.  ""Drinking to thirst is the ideal situation,"" said Dr. George Chiampas, medical director of the Chicago Marathon. ""The message, especially when running a marathon, is not always to drink more, but to make sure you drink enough according to your individual needs and the conditions on race day.""  With guidelines and philosophies on hydration changing dramatically over the past two decades, confusion still exists over what, how much and when to drink during exercise.  Back in the 1970s, runners sometimes passed up fluids altogether, for fear it would slow them down or make them look weak, said Dr. Tim Noakes, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.  Attitudes began changing in the 1980s, as ads for sports drinks warned about the dangers of dehydration. Gatorade also founded the Sports Science Institute in Barrington to conduct research on exercise science, hydration and sports nutrition.  By 1996, the American College of Sports Medicine was advising athletes to drink early and as much as they could tolerate in order to replace the sweat lost during exercise.  As the dangers of overhydration came to light, however, the organization changed its position in 2007. Like many sports associations and nutritionists, it now recommends customized fluid replacement programs based on an athlete's sweat rate. Even that method overestimates the amount of fluids needed, according to some experts.  Today many runners remain baffled about how to drink during exercise, and their choices often reflect advertising messages rather than the scientific consensus, said Dr. James Winger, a sports medicine physician and hydration researcher at Loyola University Medical Center.  Nearly half of recreational runners may be drinking too much fluid during races, Winger reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in 2010.  That might not be surprising, given the dizzying number of thirst-quenching options that have flooded the marketplace, including enhanced waters, sports and energy drinks, endurance formulas, and pills or powders designed to be mixed with water.  The marketing and research power of the sport drink industry ""has convinced the public that the products are a requirement for both sport performance and health,"" said exercise scientist Paul Laursen, a researcher and performance physiologist at the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand.  Asker Jeukendrup, global senior director of the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, said sports drinks can play an important role when performance is important and the exercise lasts more than 30 minutes.  ""There is no one-size-fits-all answer,"" he wrote in an email. ""For athletes, there are situations in which drinking to thirst is appropriate and others in which thirst is not a reliable enough mechanism because thirst is affected by so many other factors. The key is to be educated, know your individual needs and go into your race with a plan.""  Copyright © 2013 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC",©

RageChat™ - at least for the time being - is not meant to be impartial; it's meant to be a platform for RageComic™ criticism, and sometimes those criticisms will be coming from a subjective place. i have seen good genre exercises in the past, and i've given them some pretty good RageScores™. but a lot of the time, i just don't feel that such things are good enough to warrant being placed at the top of the pile.  this is part of the reason i am actively seeking to expand the number of writers on the RageChat™ staff. more people means more opinions, which means a better chance of covering disparate genres fairly.",™

t5_2t5ou,DreamingAboutLife,1381443905,"I heard that there is a drug that can be given orally for demodectic mange. Is that true? Yes, under certain conditions.  Ivermectins are a class of drugs that are approved for prevention of heartworm disease in dogs and cats. Milbemycin oxime, the active ingredient of Interceptor® and Sentinel® heartworm preventives, may be used to treat demodicosis in certain cases. Certain ivermectins are used to treat parasites on cattle. In the past, the cattle preparation has been used orally for demodectic mange in some dogs. However, it is a very strong drug that can cause severe side-effects, including death, if it is not administered properly. It is not approved for use in dogs, so we would only consider using it as long as you are willing to accept liability for adverse effects. Veterinarians do not generally recommend ivermectin usage in collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Australian shepherds, old English sheepdogs, or any other herding breed.  Here's the link. http://caribbean.merial.com/livestock/Products/Pages/ivomec_injection.aspx  Here's Amazon you can buy for $40 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0002APD1Y  If you decide to use this medicine please research first.

t5_2qqjc,jesset77,1381463048,"Oh, there is a heap more to it than that. Cooking is a counter-orthogonal, heterogeneous discipline. Put a different way, ""a whole can of worms"".  My current strategy is: visit grocery store weekly. Put items into cupboards/fridge/tiny freezer that we will need at least over the next week, that will remain usable until they are eaten, and that are either ready to eat or within my family's collective skill x time budget to be able to cook. When hungry, assemble meals out of this kitchen or order food elsewhere, depending on a variety of factors.  Were I to plug into the matrix and download Chef Skizzles™ into my brain, the only portion of this equation that would change are ""within my family's collective skill x time budget to be able to cook"". That doesn't offer as much wiggle room as it sounds because a majority of healthy dishes require as ingredients:  * Fresh produce which will not last the week, meaning you've got to visit the market, or more likely multiple markets very close to every single day.  * Meats that are prohibitively expensive unless purchased in volume and stored in freezers larger than my home has room for.  * Tubers that must be stored in cool and dry conditions no part of my house is designed to maintain.  * Pantry? Look, all I have is a 40ft^2 kitchen with 20ft^2 of countertops and cupboards.  * Many of the meats mentioned above must be thawed up to days ahead of time before being cooked. Combined with choice of recipes which weave together foods purchased minutes before they spoil, and cooking output sizes that your family cannot consume in one sitting this means you must plan in great detail and with flexible contingency every meal and leftover which you intend to consume over the next several *weeks* and circumscribe everyone's itinerary to meet those demands. Remember every sitcom or Hagar comic where the wife goes ballistic because the husband was not home on time for dinner? That comes from here.  Combine with this the consideration that while 1,000 hours of training to cook efficiently may sound like a major inconvenience to one person, it pales in comparison with the expectation of an entire society to tie up 1,000 man-hours per capita so that every biped alive can learn the skills needed to become independent industrial producers of the food they happen to consume, or suffer from bad nutrition and heart disease.  The economic import is obvious: cooking *is* an economy of scale. Requiring every individual to cook their own meals is approximately as viable as expecting them to spin and weave their own clothes from scratch or build their own automobiles from scrap metal. Yes, some people can do that but by far the most efficient societal approach is for specialists to produce these goods at high volume to distribute to the masses of customers.  Healthy, ready to eat food as a commodity. That is the promise our culture *tries* to achieve with fast food and tv dinners, they just can't get the ""healthy"" part right. :/",™

As in: if you don't want to ftp hundreds of megs of CSVs around, there are really nice high-performance alternatives.  &gt;Yes they do.  No. Parsing JSON or XML is complicated.

t5_2r4lw,superfoodist,1381464169,"Thanks.   Yes I found those instructions too by Myhill while researching Mutaflor culturing. However I'm allergic to both milk and soy so those options were out of the question for me.  In addition to that I'll attach here the reply from the manufacturer I got when I asked them about culturing.   Perhaps the reply should be taken with a grain of salt because they want to sell their cultures, but then maybe not. This is one of their scientists replying to me. You can read and see what you think.   Perhaps the addition of sugar by Myhill is the reason her recipe could work, as the reply below indicates Mutaflor can not use milk by itself as a growth medium.   &gt; Thank you very much for your interest in our microbiological drug Mutaflor® and for your interesting question regarding “Super-Mutaflor®” and its ability to grow in milk.   &gt; Milk is a complex mixture of molecules with a high energy content. It would be a good substrate for microbes to grow in general. But only some organisms like the Lactobacillales are able to grow on milk. One reason for this is the limited amount of free iron within milk. Iron is a vital trace element and essential for growth. Within milk nearly all iron there is bound to a special molecule named lactoferrin. Most organisms are unable to use this bound iron. The active ingredient of Mutaflor® is the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917. Escherichia is a genus of Gram-negative, non-spore forming, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae. Members of this family usually do not grow on milk, because they are unable to use the iron bound to lactoferrin.  &gt; A another characteristic for members of this family is the degradation of sugars via the Mixed Acid Fermentation, an anaerobic fermentation where the products are a complex mixture of acids, particularly lactate, acetate, succinate and formate as well as ethanol and equal amounts of H2 and CO2. I am sure, consuming the products resulting from milk, degraded via the mixed acid fermentation, are neither healthy nor tasty.   &gt; I am sorry, but I believe there is no way to grow “Super-Mutaflor®” on milk.

Please correct me if i am mistaken.  Yes, the Inspiron has better specs. But I already mentioned why the Latitude is more expensive. Alone the warranty is more than €200 worth.  &gt; i7-4500U processor (4 M cache, tot 3,0 GHz) vs i5-4300U processor (1,9 GHz, 3M, Dual Core)  You won't notice any performance difference as long as you don't run high demanding software like Matlab or do some video converting. An Intel i5 ULV CPU would run PS or any office suit as fast as an Intel i7 ULV CPU.  &gt; Windows 8 64bit vs Windows 7 Professional  The Latitude has both licenses. It's a business line laptop, so it comes with Windows 7, but you also would get a Windows 8 key if you want to upgrade.  &gt; 16 gb RAM vs 8 gb RAM + 256 GB SSD vs 128 gb SSD  You probably will never need 16 GB of RAM. The software you listed isn't really something that would need such an amount of RAM. As for the SSD storage: yes the Inspiron has a 256 GB SSD and the Latitude only a 128 GB one. But with the Latitude you would have the possibilty to add a second drive, which isn't possible with the Inspiron.  &gt; silver aluminum vs black aluminum and plastic  The Latitude is MIL-SPEC tested. It's much more durable than any Inspiron laptop. Spill-proof keyboard, a reinforced chasis, carbon-fiber backed display, these are features you can't get on a consumer laptop like the Inspiron 15 7000. Furthermore it's not as heavy as the Inspiron, which would it make more portable (1.6 kg vs 2.6 kg).  &gt; NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 750 M 2 GB DDR5 vs Intel HD Graphics 5000  Since you're not going to play any games, you won't need a Nvidia GPU. It would be just useless.  These are two different products. The Inspiron laptop is a consumer product. Shorter warranty and not as tortured and abused in R&amp;D as a Latitude laptop, which is a business line notebook.  In the end it's your decision, both laptops are good choices. You would just have to treat the Inspiron more carefully.",®

t5_2stnr,InquisitorVawn,1381488149,"My favourite example of DoS in my own game is The Day My Seneschal Stopped The Badguys With An Amasec Bottle™.  Basically RT and Seneschal were trying to infiltrate a bit of a naughty group of other nobles (we tend to crossbreed RT and DH a bit, especially as my RT decided to get friendly with an Inquisitor, but that's another story). We had a two-on-two situation, my boys were waiting for shit to go down, the people they were meeting thought they were being big and clever, counting on using a (relatively) unknown power to fuck their shit up.  Because everyone was trying to get the drop on everyone else, we rolled initiative and the Seneschal blitzed it. He was pouring drinks at the time. Drinks from one of those huge [old-style cut crystal scotch decanters](http://p2.la-img.com/634/18054/6115413_1_l.jpg). Which was full.  Given the circumstances and his stats, after penalties and bonuses it turned out he needed to roll less than a 55 or something to hit someone.  He rolled a 1.  With 5 DoS on an improvised weapon throw, given how well he'd reacted to the situation, I decided to give it to him as a legitimate attack. Figuring those decanters aren't light, especially filled at the time with amasec, I made a GM decision to allow him to roll to see if it stunned the guy.  In the end he ended up stunned for four rounds, with his eyesocket shattered and a concussion. The heretical plan was stopped in its tracks, and the RT took all the credit.",™

t5_2sokd,SummerV,1381502806,"1. We haven't had a dramatic increase in miltiary spending in a long time. The way the military spending works is we buy the stuff now, but pay for it over time later.  That 9 million dollar drone? We'll take that now, fly it for 5 years, and then have it paid off around that time. We aren't in debt because of military spending. That would imply all things that we spend money on are of equal value which brings me to  2. The military makes money. Those guns? They had to be manufactured, in the U.S.A by Americans for pay. Same with tanks and jets and the combat clothes, and the rations. You cut that spending, you cut a massive amount of money that is going to pay the little blue collar jobs that we still have left. Boeing and Lockheed get paid big bucks to make those planes. Colt gets big bucks to make those rifles.  Which they then use to protect the PetroDollar©. Only the U.S. dollar is easily liquidized into oil. Hence why gas is so relatively cheap ion the United States compared to the rest of the indutrialized world. The only reason why it is that cheap is because our military goes round the world protecting the interests/shipments and infrastructure of our oil reserves.  Think about it, if we really wanted to fight ""evil"" we would be fighting the Zeta's in mexico, socialists and neo-nazi's in europe, rapist militiamen in Africa, etc.  Instead we fight those who would be willing to blow up an oil platform.  3rd. As I said, not all spending is equal. Imagine you are a college student, but you have hit your spending limit. Would you be equally willing to cut the amount or quality of food you eat instead of your Xbox Live monthly fee?   **TLDR** We are in 16 trillion because we continually run deficits. We run deficits because we have imporant spending (the military, infrastructure, food safety) and less is not unimportant spending (Nasa,Obamacare,War on Drugs). ",©

Their money makes money for them, their businesses and investments pretty much run themselves or have people that handle that.    So they play a game of monopoly™. But they have been playing for decades. They learned the little known secret rules of monopoly™.     *if they're friends with the banker, they get special loans.    * if they buy a few of the rich politicians (but no where near as rich as them the super rich) that can change the rules of the game, they get to skip the ""go to jail""spot and the politicians can also work on removing the bad cards from ""chance"" and ""community chest"" for them.     Over the years owning politicians has helped them make ways to shelter money from taxes, reduce effective tax rates below the rest of the players on the ""income tax"" spot, and weaken the ""luxury tax"" spot.   Meanwhile we go round and round landing on their properties every damn time, only own one shitty ass property that got devalued after we bought the card, and it generates no fucking revenue.   So, why would they ever give that game up?    Edited for formatting and to make sure I followed the rule of threes. ",™

t5_2wk6c,jeztwopointoh,1381505438,"The way people think 'Real Ale ©' is different to craft beer shows how much damage CAMRA has done or how little they have done. To save one style of beer is fine, its ok, but to coin it 'real' is just immature. People will always make cask ale in a craft beer world. So many other styles of beer have been returning to our glasses purely because of the craft beer 'movement'. Its the blinkered eyes of CAMRA that can't see that. Their generation will die out with no fan fare if they don't see this soon.   Greene King is as someone else roughly said on this post, making carbon copy pubs with no personality. Its just another wetherspoons but it brews n Wetherspoons serve craft beer.   Its depressing buying beer here in the U.K. after spending near enough a year in the states. There's no real choice be it of styles or breweries. I get bored very easily and love doing different things so having a mere 15 different beers to buy in a shop (not including piss) is frustrating to say the least.   Has no one ever approached big shops in the u.k. with a distribution deal of beer or are they just not open to it or does carlsberg etc have them under contract?

t5_2qqjc,droivod,1381513363,"That's a really short list of hearsay and innuendo. Here are actual convictions:  **Tom Ganley**, former Republican Congressional candidate, and current ""Family Values"" hypocrite, is facing three felony charges of gross sexual imposition, and single counts of kidnapping, abduction, solicitation, and menacing by stalking, according to Ryan Miday, a spokesman for County prosecutor **Bill Mason. No arraignment date has been set. Mr. Ganley allegedly groped a woman in his car dealership and attempted to insert his fingers in her vagina after sticking his hands down her pants. See the original complain here.  **Alan David Berlin**, 40, a longtime staffer for a Republican state lawmaker, was charged on May 29, 2009 with a first degree felony for unlawful contact with a minor. He is also charged with criminal attempted sexual exploitation of children, criminal solicitation to commit sexual abuse of children, all second-degree felonies, and other offenses. authorities say Berlin suggested dressing up in animal costumes during online sex chats with a 15-year-old boy. During a search, agents found wolf- and cat-type costumes in his home.  Republican sex offender &amp; former Regent University law school assistant dean **Stephen L. McPherson**, who was indicted June 7, 2008 on 13 felony sexual assault charges involving two girls, has entered a guilty plea to two counts of forcible sodomy and two counts of object sexual penetration.

Republican sex offender and former North Country assemblyman and current state Parole Board member, **George ""Chris"" Ortloff**, 61, was arrested on Monday, Oct. 13, 2008 on federal charges that he used the Internet to solicit sex with minors.

'' The New York Post reports that he had child pornography and sex paraphernalia in his possession when he was arrested. State Police reportedly searched Ortloff'''s home in Plattsburgh and a computer had been seized from his Lake Placid real estate office, officials said.

Republican Delegate **Robert McKee, known as an advocate for children's rights, is the focus of a child pornography investigation after officers searched his Hagerstown, Md home. McKee is not facing any charges right now, but as of today, Feb 15, 2008, he has resigned his position as both a state Delegate **and as executive director of the Big Brothers Big Sisters Club of Washington County.

Someone from McKee's home called the Washington County Sheriff's Department to tip off authorities and provided them with printed images from a computer.  Republican sex offender &amp; Department of Children &amp; Families press secretary **Al Zimmerman**, 40, was arrested Friday, Feb 1, 2008 and charged with eight felony charges of using a child in a sexual performance. According to an arrest report, Zimmerman offered two teens money in exchange for photographing them in sexual acts. The victims were ages 16 and 17 at the time of the crime, and at least one may have been in the care of DCF at one point, according to the report. Authorities believe some of the images date back to December 2005, the arrest report showed. Zimmerman is suspected of taking photos as recently as Friday, the report showed.   ",™

t5_2qqjc,fatcharlie24,1381517969,"Just FYI, I'm only talking about the U.S.  Some things are true everywhere, but don't assume that.  So traditionally there are 4 basic types of IP:  Copyright: Copyright traditionally protects any creative work stored in 'a medium or expression.'  So a painting on canvas, music written down, music recorded, poems written, etc.  As soon as the work is 'fixed' you gain protection immediately (you don't have to register).  Copyright has both federal and state protections.  It lasts for (usually) 120 years before going into the 'public domain' meaning anyone can use it.  We have copyright to give people incentive to create creative works.  If you could copy someones work without fear, you could sell books for the cost of the paper, freely distribute ebooks, and music.  If there is no financial incentive to create, many won't do it.  Patents: Patents protect inventions.  The invention has to be non-obvious in light of the existing state-of-the-art and actually workable (you can't patent things you can't yet do, generally).  To get a patent you have to file an application with the Patent and Trademark Office.  Part of the deal for getting protection is that you have to write out in your patent application how to make/use the invention.  You get 20 years of exclusive use starting from the day you created the invention.  After that, anyone can use your invention.  Patents are exclusively federally protected.  The give incentive to spend lots of money doing R&amp;D.  If it took you $1BB to create a new drug to treat cancer and tomorrow another company can copy your formula and sell it for just above cost of production, no one would ever spend money to develop useful inventions.  Trademarks: Trademarks work quite differently.  A trademark is a symbol, name, color, shape, etc. that identifies a product as belonging to a certain brand (e.g.: CREST toothpaste, Coke's unique bottle shape, pink for Owen Corning insulation).  The purpose of trademarks is not to give a benefit to the company, but to protect the purchasing public.  If there was no brand protection, counterfeits would be ubiquitous and there would be a race to the bottom to make the cheapest, crappiest stuff.  But with brands, you make a quality good and associate it with a mark so people can rely on the quality.  You can register a trademark with the Patent and Trademark office if you have used your 'mark' in interstate commerce and can prove that the market associates your 'mark' with your product in a particular geographical area (or everywhere) for a particular type of product (you don't automatically get use of the name in all areas of commerce, hence Lexus cars and Lexis-Nexis database aren't related).  Trademarks are also usually protected under state law and you don't have to register.  So if you see ® it is a federally registered mark.  If you see 'TM' it's not registered.  You keep your trademark for as long as your brand and mark remain unique.  If someone starts using your mark, you can sue to protect your brand, but the goal is to protect the public from fakes and counterfeits, not to give the company some benefit.  Trade Secrets: Finally there are trade secrets.  This is how Coke keeps its formula secret.  Trade secrets are covered under state laws that differ, but basically, if your secret is unique, you protect it as well as you can, and it's valuable, if someone leaks it, you can usually prevent it from being used.  But the laws vary.  Whew.  I hope that was helpful.  This is a bit above the 5yo level, but hopefully easy enough to understand.  I'm happy to write more.  Also, keep in mind that it's much, much more complicated than this so there is necessarily a bit of oversimplification.",®

If you wanted to achieve a fuller look with less wrinkles, but still wanted to get all 'Willis on a fool', that's your option. [And I quote:](http://www.classicface.com/skin-rejuvenation/botox.cfm)  &gt;BOTOX Cosmetic is a purified protein derivative that temporarily relaxes certain offending facial muscles that cause negative wrinkles. Unlike injectable fillers like JUVÉDERM®, it does not fill in wrinkles; it just relaxes the offending muscle that forms the wrinkles.  If you want the best of both worlds (less wrinkles with facial expressions) go with a dermal filler :)",®

t5_2qpp6,Gelatinousgelboy,1381521899,"So it's been eating at me that the leveling in SC2 ends and leaves no opening (other than MOAR levels and specific achievements) to earn more rewards. I decided to sketch up some ideas on how they could organize a token (in this case minerals®!) based unlocking system. Once you cap out in xp, you start earning minerals®, which you can use to unlock a specific group of rewards (which aren't unlocked in other ways). With this system in place, microtransactions/etc. could easily be added if Blizz wanted. At its core, though, this would not change the leveling system and raising the level cap wouldn't break its implementation.  I am aware of the work that would be involved, etc. etc. etc. and I'm pretty sure I have some sort of neurotic need to make these every so often.  EDIT: any feedback, ideas or photoshop battling is totally encouraged. I could make the psd available if anyone wantss it.  UPDATE: [Here's an updated mockup with vespene as the money-resource.](http://imgur.com/a/ZfLpR#0)  UPDATE2: So if we assume microtransactions, I think it'd be really important to support the custom map community with a system like [TF2 Map Stamps](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Map_Stamp). So you can send vespene® (or something) to the creator of a map through its arcade page. An extra tab shows a leaderboard of the greatest donators per map. Being at the top of a map leaderboard temporarily unlocks a special portrait/decal which tells people you're awesome (or somesuch). The map creators get the money that is donated to their maps. This would not limit who can PLAY maps but rather reinforces and supports the most awesome of maps and their makers.",®

t5_2vizz,jackpup,1381524507,"&gt; Women in tech have, or so they may believe, much to gain in being perceived as “one of the bros.” Much of the critical networking, decision-making and team bonding important to career growth occurs in male-dominated spaces, cemented by heteronormative male bonding. Gaining access to these spaces — or simply achieving the level of comfort and camaraderie that white men in the industry share as the foundation for their work relationships — may, or may seem to, open up career opportunities. Being “one of the bros” is only possible by presenting a non-threatening persona that is aligned with male privilege and emulates the bonding techniques of straight, masculine men… and often its attendant misogyny (such as participating in casual denigration of women in the workplace).  Speaking as a shitlord in the engineering/IT field, I don't give a shit about women needing to prove they're ""one of the bros"", wishing eternal damnation upon the rest of women as long as ""they got theirs"" so I can masturbate to my own privilege. The tech sector demands results, period. Don't blame the tech sector for outside factors that discourage girls from programming and engineering. Lobby school boards or something to introduce it in schools. [This comic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7SAZN.gif) illustrates the disconnect pretty well, I think. It's not an issue of guys hating women or squeezing women out. Ours not a male space, it's a results-driven space. We don't go home and fantasize about marginalizing women in the workplace. I don't have children, but if I have a daughter, I will be thrilled to offer her metaphorical MechaBlox™, because we need more engineers, period, for our future endeavors.",™

t5_2s5gk,Ivebeenfurthereven,1381535396,"Heh, I know.  I used to drive my car a lot for a student (UK average annual mileage is 12-15,000, iirc - and that's for employed families - I was doing 30k in a year at one point).  Twelve months ago, I switched universities, and moved to a new city. The new place wanted £420 a year residential parking fees. I was actually prepared to pay it without much question or forethought, ""it's only £10 a week""... until they wanted it all in one lump sum.  Something clicked in my head that day as I prepared to part with a major chunk of change for *residential parking alone*. I left the car sitting at my parents' house and just took my bike.   What a difference it makes when you can't wimp out. Before, I cycled on a sunny day, but anything from running late to a chilly breeze sent me scurrying to do short journeys by car.  Presented with no alternative but to just get on with it in bad weather, you quickly harden the fuck up™.  And then you start to love it... and then a little later, you see your car for what it is. An expensive headache that's keeping you overweight.  I mentioned a change of car. Yeah, I've got a newer one (away from university, I live in the middle of nowhere!) - but with a completely different goal. To keep the annual mileage minimised and costs down.  I'm glad they tried to take £420 from me all at once, best thing that ever happened to me. I've lost loads of waistline inches, seen my new city far more intimately and personally, but most importantly - realised what BS the costs of driving are, and noticed my wallet's consistently a lot less empty!",™

t5_2qstm,bobsmithhome,1381537294,"There are three things to consider regarding the ""safety"" of disclosing your login credentials to a third party.   1) The one typically addressed here has to do with Mint's security protocols. You'll see many comments, like the one above, which proclaim that, ""Mint uses the same, if not better, security measures that your bank uses"". Maybe that's true. Maybe it isn't. You will need to decide whether you are willing to place your trust in the security protocols of the Intuit Corporation.  2) Mint is a free service. They have no fiduciary duty toward you. If something goes wrong, you're on your own.  3) And finally (and this is what most people fail to consider), if you disclose your passwords to a third party you are probably voluntarily waiving any guarantee your financial institution provides regarding unauthorized/fraudulent transactions. IOW, you are electing to assume 100% of the risk should your account be compromised. Vanguard's policy, for example, is pretty clear on this: **""Our commitment regarding online security is simple. If assets are taken from your account in an unauthorized online transaction on Vanguard.com®—and you've followed the steps described in the Your responsibilities section below—we will reimburse the assets taken from your account in the unauthorized transaction.""**  They go on to list those responsibilities. This is the relevant line:  **""Never share your user name, password, or other account-related information with anyone.""**  https://personal.vanguard.com/us/help/SecurityOnlineFraudPledgeContent.jsp  So... lets say you have disclosed your login credentials to Mint and your assets at Vanguard go missing. What do you think Vanguard is going to do? Well, they'll probably check the logs and see that an IP address owned by Mint has been accessing your account regulary, and their legal department will send you a nice note ""apologizing for the inconvenience"" and telling you, very politely, that it's not their problem.  So is it ""safe""?  I suppose that depends on how much you have to lose. I sure as hell wouldn't do it. It simply isn't worth any risk, IMO. I spent a lifetime building my assets, and there's no way I''m going to let Vanguard off the hook, should something go wrong, in exchange for a little convenience.  There are many ways to track finances that don't involve disclosing passwords to a third party.  I hope this helps.",®

At first I had them sleep on opposite sides of the crib and I would find them face to face when I would look in on them. I don't know how they did that as newborns! I finally had to separate them at 5 months because the one twin liked to sleep on top of the other one. At 6 months old my daughter Bridget climbed out of her crib, crawled across the room &amp; climbed in her sisters crib. I know it sounds unbelievable but it's true. Lots of fun coming your way. ♥",♥

t5_2qk72,short4bob,1381542736,"I have a pretty big climbing library, but most of these are from the ""vanilla"" section. Check the end of my post and I can make some more specific recommendations.  Anything by John Long. He can make me laugh hard and cry hard. ""The Green Arch"" is an all-time classic and cracks me up when I even think about it. I think it's in *Rock Jocks, Wall Rats, and Hangdogs.* Probably in a few others as well. His non-climbing adventure stories are delightful too.  Anything by Joe Simpson, if you like getting introspective about Why We Climb™. Every time a friend of mine dies climbing (not that it happens constantly, but it's happened enough that I've been through the book a few times) I read *The Beckoning Silence,* which is about Simpson trying to make sense of his friends dying and why he continues to climb.  *The Endless Knot* by Kurt Diemburger, about his attempt on K2. Rips my guts out every time I read it. His other books are lovely reads as well. Great writing, great love for the Alps, the Himalaya, and high places in general. Great attention to regional detail, down to lichen and flowers.  *The Accidental Adventurer* by Barbara Washburn, Mrs. Bradford Washburn's autobiography. A nifty look at mountaineering in the early part of the 20th century from a point of view readers don't normally get to see.  Check out the Boardman-Tasker prize winners. You can't go wrong with most of that stuff.  Read some, see what/who you like, and I'll recommend you some stuff based on what you enjoyed. I can tell you what *I* like all day, but it'll be easier to recommend stuff for you once you try a few things and figure out what *you* enjoy. What kinds of climbing do you like to do? What kinds of places would you like to explore? What kinds of personalities appeal to you? ",™

t5_2ve1u,7r1993rWarn1n9,1381562588,"Not really. If you believe the myth of the evil, manipulative, entitled ""Nice Guy™"" you fell for feminist BS. Yes, there's probably some guys who describe themselves as nice but have grown bitter and mysogynistic after years of rejection, and some that have always been like that and never actually were nice. But they are a tiny minority among the ""Nice guys"". There simply are a lot of well-behaved Betas who act like they've been told to act their entire lives and get nothing from that, and after a lot of rejection start to wonder out loud what they've been doing wrong, and why those who don't kiss up to women, and even full-blown assholes, seem to be much more successful. This is a dangerous heresy to feminism (and women who like having orbiters around), because if the idea that women like assholes spreads, those ""good boys"" they liked having around might get a little more disobedient. Also being asked why they prefer somebody who mistreats them to somebody who treats them nicely must be absolutely extenuating for their hamsters. Lucky for them, they managed to reframe the whole thing into the infatuated betas being manipulative (because, as we all know, supplicating is a great seduction strategy, that's why nice guys insist on it no matter how many times it fails) and entitled (because feeling sad about being turned down by the girl they were pinning for or wondering why they keep getting friendzoned means they consider unrestricted access to every woman's body their birthright).  So these guys, instead of being told that the way they act makes them terribly unattractive and that they should be confident, dominant, masculine, [insert entire red pill here], just get shouted down whenever they dare ask what they are doing wrong, and told to be even more subservient and pussy-whipped, because even their terribly Beta selves are awful woman-hating almost-rapists.  Just look up ""nice guy"" or ""friendzone"" in any angry-feminist site like Jezebel. That is the kind of people pushing this myth, and quite successfully.",™

t5_2qv2r,chaseizwright,1381585015,"Our D line needs to bring the heat to Mettenburger and I fully expect that they will. fowler is playing like an all-American and its because of 'Champs scheme that allows the weak side end (fowler) to come through seemingly unblocked in many situations. He will be critical to get hits on their qb and stop drives, force fumbles, etc.  TM is going to ball out as you said because of LSUs garbage secondary and his propensity to remain calm and deliver strikes to his open man. I still can't believe we are all turning into Murphy lovers but this game will solidify him as the first QB we have loved since Tebow. I really liked Driskel last year but he never had the composure that TM has shown us so far. If he can maintain it in Death Valley, we gone be goooood.   I'm honestly not sure if our D line combined with our secondary is going to allow LSU to break any home run or explosive pass plays I just don't think they are going to have time for those type of plays to develop unless they can break a few tackles.  I feel like they really should get Ahmad Fullwood into action against these little corners and throw some jump balls in the endzone.. Kids huge.  As far as tight ends... Yeah Clay might be the best we have right now until Kent puts some wait on (and then oh god watch out for him) but I think Clay deserves some looks because he would add another fold to our offense and make it even more difficult to defend. He can catch a football I've seen him do it.  Lastly, WILL SOMEBODY GO SNATCH MATT JONES BY HIS DREADS AND TELL THAT MOTHER FUCKER TO RUN ARROOUUUNNNDDDD THE DEFENDER AND STOP DROPPING HIS HELMET AND RUNNING LITERALLY DIRECTLY INTO THE ONLY S.O.B.

But not my first.  ◾I don't give up answers easily.  ◾Your reality is a game to me. And I like games.  ◾I bet you're wondering who I am.   Also, there was capitalized letters spelling- My Name Is Bill  3.) [Old man McGucket wrote the books. This is because of a leaked photo of him writing the book when he seems younger and has six fingers](#spoiler)  4.) Fingers. People have different number fingers, and many people have created theories for that. Some think the fingers represent a level of innocence. [Also, it seems as if the police's number of fingers have changed from four to five](#spoiler)  5.) SFTBE. Have you heard of it? I know it isn't exactly Gravity falls related, but it has lots to do with this reddit. The site appeared before the last episode with the cipher and when you clicked below the Bill GIF, it said October 1st. It later released a forgotten tale, which we are still investigating, and there appears to be a new part of it every week. Anyway, nobody knows who created it, just that they seem to have inside info.  6.)

Their flag is the anarcho-syndicallist flag painted yellow, the ""V for Voluntary"" was taken from V for Vendetta and the Voluntaryist symbol looks a shit ton like the Ingsoc one too.   The other right-libertarian symbols all come from ""patriotic"" origins that are usually associated with Conservatism and general american populism (Gadsden Flag, Tea Party and frequent appeals to ""*LIBERTY!*®"" the most obvious ones).",®

t5_2qiel,staalinthefamily,1381604935,"Pierre has a history of sort of...latching on to players. Before Sidney came onto the scene he was Dion Phaneuf's Biggest Fan™. Since his drafting, Pierre will take any excuse to talk about Sid...even while not actually commentating on a Pens game.   Player on RandomTeam scores a goal? Pierre will chime in that Sidney Crosby has a billion times more goals than that player ever has, and he scored them more beautifully too. Player on the bench drinking Gatorade? Did you know that Crosby's favorite flavor of Gatorade is the blue kind? Also hey, did you know the Pens are playing a game right now? Pierre bets Sid has had like five--no *ten* highlight worthy shifts by now.  The jokes largely come from how hilariously creepy and obvious his crush on Crosby is, in addition to how aware and creeped out Sid is of Pierre's stalking.   Another thing I enjoy is his hatred for Alexander Semin because Semin once claimed that Patrick Kane is better than Sid. He has been Pierre's Number One Enemy since and that shit is *amazing*. You could tell that the only thing that would have made Pierre happier during the period where Semin was unable to get the Caps to resign him would have been if Sidney finally caved to Pierre's demands and gifted him with his [lucky jock](http://youtu.be/KHdNU3CRdjg?t=1m20s).",™

t5_2ulfn,Fascion,1381615586,"There is a difference, yes.  Whether or not it will be a noticeable one depends a lot on what it is you are doing with the knife and your experience with truly sharp knives.  Comparing a legit strop to, say, a cheap JCPenny belt, you will find two major differences.  First and foremost is the tanning method.  Any serious strop is going to be vegetable-tanned, whereas cheaper leather is most often chrome-tanned.  They™ say that the vegetable tanning process leaves behind more of the natural silicates in the leather, which is what allows leather to... well... strop.  The playing field is leveled a bit when you start talking about adding compounds to the strop, as you are effectively one-upping the leather's natural abrasives.  Even then, a real strop will usually maintain an advantage, as they are often made with the more expensive ""full grain"" leather.  If you're using a cheap belt, odds are it's probably ""top grain"" leather, which doesn't accept the compounds quite as well.  Honestly, a good strop wont set you back too much.  No reason to deprive yourself of such a valuable tool.  With proper stropping and care, you shouldn't have to break out the serious hardware (Lansky, Edge Pro, Wicked Edge, stones) but once in a blue moon, greatly extending the life of your knives.  Fun fact: you can also strop on things like cardboard (such as that found on the back of a pad of paper,) glossy magazine covers, post-it notes, and newsprint.  This is because of the clays used in the production of these papers.",™

I haven't read it all yet but I'm still taken aback by this:   ""The intended use of Curcumin C3 Complex® in the above mentioned food categories, is estimated to result in a **maximum daily intake of 180 mg** curcuminlperson (3 mg/kg body weight/day for an individual weighing 60 kg).""  So I'm not sure how much they recommend for a serving. If you only take 180mg or some similar amount, then you're probably fine. But personally, considering curcumin's poor bioavailability, I'm interested in taking daily servings of ~3 grams. That's part of the reason I am being especially cautious with all this.  I just noticed they say they use acetone and ethyl acetate. So that's good news, assuming that document is 100% accurate (it's an FDA document, right?). Don't know why they couldn't just tell you that when you asked. Thanks again.",®

It's painful to read someone's assertion that a BA in history makes you an expert on histories Allwhere And Everwhen.™  One of the things a good BA will do is teach you how much you don't yet know, but more importantly, how to develop that knowledge in a responsible way.  Of course, if you slid through with a barely-passing grade from Southwestern Fucknard State University or Reverend Dingdong's Bible College, you may not even really understand what a historian is or what one really does.  I can tell you that I was prepared for analytical reading and writing by my hons BA in history, but I was NOT prepared for theoretical discussions or historiographical analysis adequately at that point.  When I hit the ground in my MA program, I already understood this, and worked in a panicked frenzy to correct those basic deficits.

It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.  ----    *I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F1obuix ""Confidence: 1.00"").

I'll be back soon!  **NEW STUFF** A quick clarification:  I use the word “Tick” to describe the unvoluntary movements and noises my TS causes me to make.  “Tick” is not the proper spelling, it ought to be “Tic”, but I use Tick for 2 reasons: 1.	 Tick in my personal onomatopoeia of the sound I hear in my head when I tick. 2.	I use words like “Ticky” and “Tickish” when I describe the rate at which I’m ticking, or how I’m feeling.  So for consistency’s sake, I spell the word “Tick”.  **Ticks:** I can usually feel a tick coming.  It feels just like the “Point of no return” when you sneeze.  Sometimes I can stop it from happening right away, sometimes I can’t, or don’t feeling coming. When I stop it, I can still feel it there.  If feels similar to when you REALLY have to pee, but can’t get to a bathroom right away, so you have to hold it.  After a few minutes my whole body is SCREAMING to let the ticks come out.  I feel much better after a tick happens. A tick for me, is a way to “fix” or “release” an uncomfortable sensation that has built up somewhere in my body.  I don’t tick to feel good, I tick to make an area feel normal again.  *Ticks I exhibit:* I have both motor and vocal ticks.  To be diagnosed with TS you much have motor ticks and at lease one vocal tick. I jerk my head at my left shoulder. My right arm flails up, sort of like an odd salute. Sometimes my head jerk and arm flail happens at the same time. A leg will “kick out”. I flex the muscles in my arms and leg. I furrow my browns. I stretch my eyes very wide and they stick that way for a bit. I clench my jaw. I wheeze out all the air in my lungs and hold it. I make a small “Hm” sound in the back of my throat. I repeat words or phrases people say to me, or anything that gets stuck in my head.  **TS and other issues.** It is common for people with TS to also have ADD, ADHD, OCD, Schizophrenic, or be slightly autistic. (Like Aspergers) It’s common for us to experience anxiety, insomnia, and depression. I have TS, there are things I’m OCD about.  I can have anxiety here and there, I’m definitely an insomniac, and I have depression issues.  **Being in public.** I usually have a good handle of my ticks so I can suppress them or disguise them while I’m in public, but when they do happen, and they are noticeable, I either explain to any strangers who look worried/confused/interested, and if nobody looks worried/confused/interested, I just let it go.  I go to the movies.  I only have a few vocal ticks, and they’re pretty quiet, so I don’t think I’ve even been a disruption. The only time I’m ever really embarrassed is when young children mime my ticks when they see them.  They’re just being kids, but it still kinda makes me feel sad.  *School* Nobody made fun of me in high school. I tried to go to college, however the stress of being on my own and un-related medical issues made my ticks become debilitating, and I could not commute because it was not safe for me to drive.  The school was not accommodating, and I failed out.  I probably could try to go again because my symptoms are much less bothersome now, but I don’t want to.  *Personal Life* It has never affected my friendships or my ability to find a boyfriend.  All my friends have learned to ignore my ticks, just like I do, and when a tick is funny, they laugh right along with me.  I currently have a GREAT, supportive, loving, and understanding boyfriend.  We live together, and I don’t think he really notices my ticks anymore, unless he ends up getting hit by one.  **Sex** Yes, I can have sex. Yes, sometimes I tick during sex, but since my man loves me for me, he has learned to ignore it. If I ever tick enough to ruin the moment, we take a quick time out and then get back to the fun stuff.  **Treatment** I currently do not take any kind of medicine.  Medicine is available to me, but it has a bunch of bad side effects, and I don’t want to encounter them if my current symptoms are minor. On sparse occasions I have used THC recreationally.  THC stops all of my ticks.  I am currently not planning on using THC for medicinal purposes, as it is still illegal in Ohio, but I think that it should be legalized, that way it is an option for me, and many other people, if I need it in the future.  **Supression** I don’t have a way to describe or advise how to suppress ticks.  I just… Do.  I wish I could find the words to describe it, but it’s like describing a color without using colors.  **Videos** My identity is not really a secret, but I prefer to not be forthcoming, as this is the internet, and you are all strangers. I don’t think I will be posting a video, as it will be primarily watched just for people to see me tick, and I don’t want to make a spectacle or a sideshow of myself.  I might consider it in the future, but not today. As for a picture of myself, I guess that’s okay.

t5_2cneq,worldsmithroy,1381688338,"tldr;  * The technology a modern farmer uses depends on a lot of other technology * Technology depends on a society to develop and maintain * The modern farmer is only able to farm so efficiently because of the society he is a part of * Society depends on people working together * 1 asshole with a torch &gt; 1 farmer with thousands of acres * Videos!  /tldr;  The problem is two-fold - the modern farmer has technological dependencies and social dependencies.  The farmer's technology needs other technology to create and support it, which in turn has other technological dependencies.  The tractor needs a factory to manufacture it, fuel to power it, and mechanics to maintain it.    The farmer's social dependencies are equally complex.  He needs people willing and able to pay him to farm for them (which means he must be part of a society complex enough to allow subsistence via industry (which requires a larger society)).  He needs transportation infrastructure to get his products to far enough markets that it is profitable for him to farm ""thousands of times more land than individuals with ancient equipment,"" which also requires a society to implement.  He even depends on the society to lend resources back to protect him and his acreage from all manner of disasters, both natural (e.g. storms) and man-made (e.g. invaders).  Heck, he even depends on society to help ensure that he has the water he needs to power his fields (either due to competition from other water-users, or due to contamination of ground water).  His technological dependencies also have the same long chains of dependencies stretching out from them - there need to be enough farmers in the society for the tractor making business to start up.  There need to be enough people using fuel for the fuel manufacturers and refiners to survive as a business (or subsistence) model.  There need to be enough educated people to perpetuate the knowledge of how to build and maintain the tractors, the factories that run them, and the refineries and wells that power them.  All of these people - the farmers, the tractor makers, the oil refiners, the produce consumers, the water drinkers, and the water-drinker regulators - all of them need to have a reason to work together.  The mechanic can actually be a full-time mechanic only because he is buying his food from the farmer, but he needs enough demand for his services that his craft-specialization can allow him to subsist.  The farmer has to have a reason to spend the resources working thousands of times more land growing crops for everyone.  People have to be able to specialize in their crafts for long enough to promote development of the state of the art.  All of these things require people to be willing to work together.  This means that society has to give enough of its citizens enough of a reason to stay working within the system, to permit the system to keep working.  Otherwise people will stop being part of your society, which historically has been a Very Bad Thing™.  [The interconnections of technology were discussed very well by James Burke in his hallmark series 'Connections'](http://youtu.be/WgOp-nz3lHg).  [The importance of groups of people needing other people to maintain modern society was also discussed very nicely in a TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html)",™

Which, in any other forum, would be an odd thing to say, since asking reasonable questions is how we learn, and is supposed to be a good thing. Part of growing up is learning to judge the answers you receive. We know though, that where we come from, asking certain types of questions is seen as a bad thing. We're told that information from 'apostates' is from the devil, as though there were no doubt that the devil even exists.    Really though, real truth (not The Truth©) should have nothing to fear from facts, no matter where they come from. In fact, attacking the messenger is one of the [logical fallacies]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).   I learned how the bible's flood story is only a myth, and completely physically impossible, [here]( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html), but only after I gave myself permission to look at sources other than the WTBS. For me, that was the beginning of the end. If they'd gotten that so wrong, what else are they wrong about? That site has good basic information on how evolution works. Study it, you'll be amazed and shocked at how you've been lied to.  I started my journey to intellectual freedom much later in life than you, so well done for getting started now. I wish you all the best on your search for the REAL truth. ",©

t5_2qh4u,oculus42,1381714017,"1) I've had very few freezes on my MBP. It's pretty stable. As everyone says, it is usually only power cycled for system updates. I've had a few small issues I've spent some time tracking down; mostly relating to unapproved Time Machine drive (networks shares and the like). I did have a motherboard replacement (covered) due to the faulty graphics chip.  2) My MBP is from 2007. In that time I've upgraded the RAM (4GB Max) and swapped in an SSD. It will apparently run Mavericks, which I'll probably install but, really, an upgrade is pretty much in order at seven years. My PowerBook G3 (Pismo) lasted seven years before I upgraded, as well.  3) High prices? It is a world of thousand-dollar computers. Almost all Macs are in the $1k+ range. In my opinion, they are very much worth it, but out-of-warranty repairs can be costly. Check out iFixIt for a sampling of repair procedures and costs if you think you'll beat up your laptop.  4) The interface is not very customizable. There are apps and tweaks for the OS to make it a little more as you prefer, but I've mostly stuck with the interface as-is for the last decade. I think some of that is my desktop support background; it's very convenient to sit down at another computer and know where things are and how the work, even if it isn't exactly how you would like them.  Having a Real, Honest Terminal™ is really nice. I've used Linux a bit since 1996, and it's nice to have command line tools. A single line of ipfw can provide throttling to a shared network connection for downloading Windows updates without sucking down all the bandwidth on a slow connection.

t5_2qh6c,MilesBeyond250,1381714159,"Unfortunately, the issue boils down to this. Whether or not you're free to criticise a song has nothing to do with heart attitude or anything spiritual, and everything to do with whether the people you're with like that song or not. Find someone who attacks you for criticising worship music, saying things like ""Your heart just isn't in the right place,"" or ""How dare you be critical of something the Spirit of God is using to encourage so many!"" and just keep criticising a variety of songs and hymns from different genres or traditions. Sooner or later, no matter how much pseudo-piety they exude, you will hit on one that will make them say ""Oh man, I know! I can't believe that gets played in churches!""   When you try to point out this double-standard to them, they will immediately backpedal and draw a distinction between worship music and TrueWorshipMusic™ and how it's okay to criticise the former but unthinkable to criticise the latter, but it's too late. They've already shown their true colours. They'll claim that there's a need to tear down ""harmful"" worship music and promote ""edifying"" songs, but a little questioning will reveal that their definition of ""harmful"" is ""something I dislike/disagree with"" and their definition of ""edifying"" is ""something I like/agree with.""   Either nothing is open to criticism, or everything is, and the statement about how ""You shouldn't be tearing down the things God is using to build up people"" is just vapid blathering that fundamentally attempts to say ""Stop making fun of things I like!"" in a more pious fashion.",™

But when I finally talked to him, he immediately acknowledged me and turned out to be one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He was not pretentious or antagonistic in any way at all, he was extremely personable and seemed to genuinely enjoy any sort of conversation.

t5_2tcpq,aufleur,1381757643,"If someone being trans* isn't a deal breaker in a relationship then why even bother to argue an opinion you don't even hold yourself?   Also, if you can generically use ""I"" as a means of expressing yourself without referring to yourself, then why am I not allowed to use ""you"" in a generic way?   Listen, /u/Othello you've made it crystal clear that you don't hold these positions yourself. If I've offended you, or upset you, or made you feel alienated during this discussion, I apologize.   ---  &gt;Transgender people are often the target of harassment and discrimination in various forms. Likewise, being in a relationship with a transgender person can lead to harassment as well.... being transgender is an incredibly difficult thing in and of itself, and when you toss in discrimination or the potential for such, things get even worse.  This isn't any different then it was for interracial couples 40 years ago. Truth is, if you love someone, it doesn't matter. If I had to tell you I'm trans* on a date because you didn't know, then you don't have a lot to worry about because no one is going to notice anyway.   &gt;Maybe I am (once again) someone who is in a delicate place mentally/emotionally and I feel that it is best for me to avoid getting into a relationship with someone who is potentially in a similar (if not worse) place than I am.   Don't worry, I wouldn't date someone like this. If you're in a delicate emotional state you shouldn't be dating anyway. Besides, an emotionally unstable partner isn't going to be someone anyone would be able to form a healthy relationship with. If I'm out and about dating, then my mental state is under control. Additionally, anyone with a poor mental state is going to be someone you and I both would avoid when considering a relationship–and that's reasonable. If because I'm trans* you instantly assume my mental state is ""unstable"" then that would be unfair.  ---  anyways, I hope you accept my apology and actually I hope that you respond to the answers I gave to your examples. I'm interested to hear what you had to say.   ♥  ",♥
t5_2s7cl,cypher_chyk,1381758777,"Wow if its not one thing its another eh hun?I agree with Jen_Snow. You can't control your mothers emotions, just focus on yourself. If your sister is motivating you not to be a deadbeat like her then don't be a deadbeat, but focus on yourself and not your mom.Talking to counseling is a good idea though, because it sounds like you are freaking out. Stick to your guns and original plan. Nothing new is changing for YOU right? Your baby is still healthy, and daddy is doing what he needs to do? Good, then let it be. Both your mother and sister are grown adults (your sister is by Canadian standards anyways) and can figure it out.I really hope you feel better soon. I realize that this is a stressful time in your life in general, but just like your mom had to come to terms with you making your own decisions and not being able to control you, the same is vice versa. That's not to say you can't do something nice for her though to show your appreciation for this lady 😉",😉

t5_2qn5f,branewalker,1381768612,"L1 Judge here.  Sometimes the IPG is harsh. Many of the lower-level infractions come across as fairly severe for a few reasons:  1. Potential for abuse is a factor in penalties. This is why things like Drawing Extra Cards carries a game loss. Investigating *what* happened is hard enough. Investigating *why* the player did it is even harder. When the action has a high enough potential for abuse, it's best to treat everyone equally. Yes, it does catch ""innocent"" mistakes, but it also helps prevent cheating.  2. Would *you* trust your opponent at Competitive REL to give you the correct oracle text on a card? What if the page were out of date, or had been modified, etc?  3. If we had to investigate *everything* for intent before providing a ruling, judges would have to be human lie-detectors and rules infractions would take a LOT longer, which isn't fair to the rest of the players in the tournament who are waiting on you to finish your round with a time extension. It doesn't matter to THEM why it happened, but many of them traveled hours to get to the tournament, and adding 10 or 15 minutes to every round adds up. Plus, judging staff would have to increase, which either pays us less for more work, or means TOs have to increase their entry fees, etc. etc. Anyway, some things just have to be hard-and-fast rules, with an emphasis on fast.  4. As an extension of 3, judges have the entire tournament to worry about. We're kind of the parents of the event. While we love all of our children, sometimes they do stupid things without asking us first. We have to concern ourselves with smoothly running the tournament *over* the needs of the individual player. So, yes, a match loss seems harsh from a player perspective, but from a judge's perspective, it's a small issue in a larger event.   All that said, the head judge *can* downgrade penalties when the potential for abuse isn't high. However, that's at the judge's discretion.  From the MTR,  &gt; **Judges** will not generally assist players in determining the current game state but can answer questions about the rules, interactions between cards, or **provide the Oracle™ wordings of relevant cards.**  (emphasis mine)  TL;DR It may seem harsh, but judges have to keep the needs of the tournament in mind, and not just the individual player. Your friend would have been better served if he'd called the judge to get the Oracle text.",™

t5_2qpp6,Gelatinousgelboy,1381774273,"Hey guys, I'll give you some explanation of my intentions and response to critiques:  This is an expansion of my [Minerals® mockup](http://imgur.com/a/BjGRe#0), which was focusing on giving a way to earn rewards beyond the leveling system (specifically you earn 'minerals' when you hit a level cap, which you can use to unlock rewards). It followed that microtransactions could also be used to unlock this content. Microtransactions can be sketchy, so it's important that content which can be bought is also unlockable by playing the game (enter Minerals®), doesn't affect gameplay (never pay2win), and is very specifically a BONUS (added separately from an expansion release).  In this case, Vespene® is the microtransaction resource that you buy to unlock rewards.  Now about the map marketplace: I'm really leery of a system that could block custom maps behind a pay gate (not necessarily Blizz's intention). Maybe I'm being idealistic, but I'd prefer something that let's you PLAY any map to your heart's content *and* allows you to support map makers as you see fit. One is encouraged to contribute with cool rewards (portraits, decals, skins, etc.). Map makers are encouraged to continue generating awesome content for SC2 because they have an official revenue source.  The idea of making SC2 multiplayer free is *potentially* a really cool idea. I want to make sure **IF** Blizz goes for it, they do it right.  I'm sure Blizz doesn't need these mockups for the ideas, but I'm hopeful I can give a different perspective and engage the community in a discussion of what we actually want out of the game.",®

When you finally get into the country, be prepared to wait for 2-3 hours at customs so that they can take your fingerprints for the *n*-th time and ask you *again* if you have any intentions on murdering the President. And you'll have to stay in line the entire time. If you go to the restroom you'll likely lose your spot (unless you can convince someone to defend your space with honor).  Now that you're in the US, it all goes downhill. You'll have trouble getting a proper place to stay without being ripped off, because you don't have a Social Security number. You'll probably purchase a bicycle because public transportation is **HORRIBLE** in many parts of the states. Then you realize you probably shouldn't have purchased your bicycle at Target, because one component breaks every week, leaving you with no brakes and crooked handlebars. You'll fix these things every day before your bike ride, and they'll break before you get home again.  So now it's time to buy a car, obviously, since you've tried public transportation and biking. You'll buy a used car you found on Craigslist because you simply don't have $5000 in cold hard cash as a foreigner, it'll be sold as-is and will be a rip off. Even if you *do* pay $5000 you'll still get ripped off. The good thing is that once you have a car, gas is cheap and everything is a lot smoother. The bad thing is that there are all these hidden fees and things you have to take care of as a US car owner. There isn't just *one* yearly car inspection and regular servicing, there's emissions inspection, state inspection, and probably a whole lot of other bureaucratic regulatory hoops to jump through.  So, **great**, you're finally in the US, with a proper form of transportation, you realize that there are [Xenoestrogens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoestrogen) in almost all the food you'll eat. You have to either buy Organic™ food or Regular™ food, with the former option being about 5-10 times more expensive (and often more difficult to procure or acquire). All right, you can still get by, one organic meal a week and cheapskate chicken breasts, mac &amp; cheese and other low-quality food for the other days. Eventually you'll stop cooking every day. You'll go out to Five Guys, Panda Express, Chipotle or Chic-fil-A (at which point you'll indirectly be supporting anti-gay movements, but you *will* feel conflicted because their sandwiches just taste so ##cking good). Eventually you'll start going to McDonalds too, and now you're really living the [American life](http://funny-pics-fun.com/funny-compilations/funny-america-american-dream).   Eventually you'll get acquainted with the dating and social situation in the states, and that'll make life a little bit more bearable. You'll still have lots of crime, ignorance and bureaucracy to deal with, though, so the fun's not over yet!  Take it from me, pal. I moved to the states and I've gotten to terms with it, but the grass really is greener on the other side. Your side, the side from which I came, the better continent, the one without America. I hate to be a hater, but the states make it way too easy.  On the plus side, Amazon doesn't have tax here. I guess that's kind of good. Oh but wait, [here's why you shouldn't shop at Amazon](http://stallman.org/amazon.html), if you look around on that site you'll find a bunch of problems, many of which are caused by the US.  Now, read some of the other positive reviews before you let this negative one affect you, you will need to weigh the good and the bad when deciding whether or not moving to ""America"" is a good idea for you. Maybe you should try Canada first?",™

The IPG is quoted by the OP, and all of Outside Assisstance that would apply is there. A ""Oracle™ page"" seems fairly clear, but it could cause some confusion.  Looking a bit further into the Magic Tournament Rules gives us  &gt;Players may refer to Oracle text, either electronically or in paper form, at any time. They must do so publicly and  in a format (such as gatherer.wizards.com, other official Wizards of the Coast sources, or printouts of their  sources) which contains no other strategic information.   Which makes sense.  Players are allowed to pull up Gatherer on their smart phones during a match, and it would be awkward for the rules to create a situation where a player could be punished for scrolling too far.  What could cause this sort of thing to be deserving of an Outside Assisstance penalty?  Still in the hypothetical, having any sort of writing on the page other than the printed text from Gatherer, or having the oracle text on a non-gatherer page (which might also include other information) is a big no-no.",™

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1381798070,"Some ayurvedic preparations are *supposed to* contain heavy metals. Others aren't.  Quality control in India sucks.    The claim that ayurvedic medicine is nothing but woo is interesting. If you mean that it hasn't been investigated and validated by western science, than yes, but 100 or so years ago, most of Western medicine was woo as well.  One of the big problems in investigating Ayurvedic practices using science is that practitioners often believe that the practices were devised by Enlightened Masters™ who were directly inspired by the gods of medicine and that Western science simply can't measure the subtleties involved.  Leaving aside that issue, which also pervades the GMO controversy in India (see: [The Trials of Genetically Modified Food -BT EGGPLANT AND AYURVEDIC MEDICINE IN INDIA](http://artsci.wustl.edu/~anthro/research/stone/Kudlu%20and%20Stone%202013.pdf) for more info), quality control of both ayurvedic preparations AND ayurvedic practitioners is all over the place, so it is hard to adequately test claims because you can't be sure what you are actually testing.  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his Transcendental Meditation organization, many years ago, attempted to start a revival of Ayurveda in India by bringing together the most famous ayurvedic physicians and scholars to create a modernized practice.   A few studies on consistently prepared ayurvedic concoctions marketed by the TM organization's ayurvedic branch have been published, but of course, the usual caveats about biased researchers apply. Even so, the preliminary rodent studies are suggestive that there's something of value in at least [SOME ayruvedic preparations](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22Maharishi+Amrit+Kalash%22).",™

It seems we meet again.  *Questioning look*  Because you are in one of my traps.   *Disapproving glance*  It seems like you suffer from Stockholm Syndrome and I'm just the doctor to treat it!  *Perry shrugs shoulders*  What? Why are you looking at me like that?  *Maintains look*  You don't know what Stockholm Syndrome is?  *Shakes head*  Do you want me to explain it to you?  *Shrugs*  No. Now I have to explain it to you otherwise my evil monologue prefacing my imminent victory at the hands of my Seismic Oscillate-Disruptinator Cannon^©Doofenschmirtz^Evil^Incorporated won't carry as much meannnning.  Ugh, fine Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon which can develop out of interactions between two people, usually a hostage situation, where one continually harasses, captures, beats, or hurts the other. The victim then comes to not hate the captor but rather feel sympathy for, or even, develop strong feelings for the captor. It was named after a particular robbery case in Swe--  *Perry is struggling with his bonds*  What are you doing?  *Perry stops*  You were using that incredibly long-winded explanation as an opportunity to escape weren't you?  *Perry nods*  You knew what Stockholm Syndrome was before I explained it didn't you?  *Perry proceexs escapes his bonds, throwing his hat towards a button labelled 'Do not press, will engage Seismic Oscillate-Disruptinator Cannon^©Doofenschmirtz^Evil^Incorporated'*  That seems destined to be pushed. Why did I put this here?  *Seismic waves start shaking a crane causing a crate containing a hive of bees to drop into the falcon aviary enraging both the birds and the bees*  Seriously, what was I thinking? Have I even used bees in a plan ever? Why do I even have falcons?  *Falcons escape proceeding to chase Doofenschmirtz into a bear enclosure*  CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS! Hmmm, I really need a shorter nickname to scream out at you when my plan falls horribly.  *Screams of pain ensue while Perry looks on, heartless and perfectly aware of the damage he hath wrought like a vengeful god pissing from Olympus itself. He waits until the flame of Doofenschmirtz' existence eventually flickers away, the fading light following Perry into the cold night.*  *But yet, the knowledge remained that somehow nothing will ever be the same without the continuous game of cat and mouse....without him.*",©

I thought it was bricked for a moment but a soft reset cleared it up. I'm not going to say that Nokia hardware is bulletproof, there have been many users here with issues, just stating that MY experience with Nokia hardware has been bulletproof. My phones have been dropped, more than once before I got my case. They've even gotten wet a couple times, both of them. I work in a commercial kitchen in temperatures often exceeding 100F for the entire shift and I always keep my phone on me. My L900 is still kicking after almost 3 years of abuse, I've kept it in case the worst happens with my 920. 😊The thing about WP is that its still a young platform, and it is still kind of ostracized by major devs especially Google. I'd wager the fair majority of what one would call ""essential"" apps on WP are third party, so make sure that we have the apps you need, or ones that will serve your needs. It can take some searching, but there are plenty of hidden gems to be found from 3rd parties.I'd also like to say that my buddy just got a Note 2, and my 920 is faster than it, and it's brand new. Faster boot up, faster interface, faster keyboard (should check out a recent thread here about the WP8 keyboard) etc.Edit: Also, Edge Browser is coming, and it's beautiful.

t5_2qhrv,die_igel,1381818532,"Hey, let's paint a world where she's not the Evil Bitch™.  She's a law student.  Maybe she's a law student at a top law school.  That means she's smart.  As a woman, especially an attractive woman, she's used to being judged on her appearance rather than her intelligence.  Because she's intelligent she *sees* when this is happening and sees that it has given her advantages, but part of her resents it.  She can use it and she knows she'd be better off if she *did* use it, but it feels like a compromise. She wants to succeed by dint of her competence, not her beauty.  Most successes in her life came with an implied caveat: ""HB10 is successful (but mostly because she's pretty).""  Watch this video of Dustin Hoffman talking about his role in Tootsie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPAat-T1uhE  Now, with that picture of Evil Bitch™ in your head, rethink what happened.  She walked up and gave you a hard shove, metaphorically.  What is she doing?  In this world, she's probably testing you to see if you'll let her get away with it.  Why?  It's a way for her to test how you see her.  If you let her walk over you that's consistent with you being in the bucket of all the men in her life who let her get away with murder or cut her an (undeserved) break because she's pretty.  It's also verbally challenging, so how you respond will tell her a lot about your intelligence.  Maybe she's doing something so over the top because she's thinking to herself, ""I'm going to do something so inappropriate that no intelligent man could possibly think I was being serious.  If they accept what I'm doing at face value, they're either letting me get away with it because I'm hot or they're a dunce.  Either way: bzzzt.""  In this world her behavior was actually an invitation in disguise.  Spot the disguise: you win and we have a fun conversation together.  Miss the disguise: I win and I have a fun conversation at your expense.  So, win-win for her!  Game on!  **Note**: I'm not saying this is what was happening.  I'm just trying to pain a world which is consistent with the one you actually experienced but different than the one in which she's just an Evil Bitch™.  The follow-up question is then, ""Why do you think your story is more likely than mine?""  For example, you said her friend was nice and normal.  Maybe she's a doormat, or maybe she is friends with her for different reasons and this is just her annoying ""party personality.""",™

t5_2qh8e,TheNossinator,1381848110,"&gt; *""Yes. And labor will continue to build things until we run out of debtors. Greece is a cautionary tale to me, a utopian state to you.""*  I agree that there is a point where you're borrowing too much, but we're nowhere near it. Our teensy debt is the envy of the developed world. When was the list time you heard Joe Hockey or Tony Abbott talk about the *Budget Emergency™*? Probably immediately after the election, and then nothing. You know why? It's because *there never was* an emergency, it was bullshit. Hockey has admitted that ""things look better from inside government,"" funny that!  And you can fuck right off putting words in my mouth about Greece. If you can't have a sensible discussion without [resorting to painfully obvious logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman), you should probably not be having the discussion. It instantly discredits what you're saying.  &gt; *""The coalition knew, through common sense, that encouraging boat people was enouraging death.""*  Is your brilliant plan to ""stop the boats"" also to stop reporting them? It's not pull factors that force people onto boats, it's what they're running from. Yes, a small percentage of people are economic migrants just wanting to live in an awesome country like Australia, but it's a lie to say it's a majority. Is the Coalition's plan to ""reduce the incentive"" to turn Australia into a place no one wants to travel to? Because that's about the only part of their policy platform that makes sense to me.  &gt; *""...accepting boat loads of people, who have passed through multiple safe countries, is enouraging unnecessary death.""*  And that's why we need a regional solution, which, believe it or not, is *not* the sole intellectual property of Abbott. But when people come knocking on the door you can't just turn them back - not only because it's dangerously irresponsible, but because Indonesia is going to be sorta pissed with us. Again, notice how Abbott has massively ramped down his rhetoric; suddenly it's not ""turn back the boats at any cost!,"" now there's a focus on co-operation.",™

In many cases that's a highly counterproductive idea, and worse, it distracts the impulsive from better ways to help.    When I was in university, I was part of a student group made of really bright, good-hearted people.  One day someone decided to do a fundraiser, similar to the Komen stuff.  The positive message was contagious, and nobody questioned the wisdom of the idea.  I went as far as to join the event (which consisted of doing laps around a big field and spending small cash that would supposedly go toward donations) and guilt-trip relatives into contributing.    Only later did I realize what a colossal waste of time it was, and how much good will I had risked in my eagerness to get money that would barely be used to fight cancer.

t5_2rxrw,succube-eprise,1381861358,"&gt; How on earth did you get ""hostile cult"" from Judaism of all things?   It's a fairly horrid religion if you look it in the face.  A holy scripture that is basically a litany about a pet god held by some desert runners that ""gives"" The Chosen Few™ all other peoples around them to freely enslave and kill; male circumcision; a Religious lineage based on inheritance, not choice; the way women are treated in orthodox Judaism; the scriptural imperative not to respect worldly authority; the institutionalized blackmail of secular authority it shares exactly with scientology and Islam; bla bla bla, I could go on and on.  All those things are - as I said - hostile to either basic human rights *or* (and) to a democratic constitution.   Yes, I know what argument comes next: Christianity incorporates the old testament which makes it almost exactly as bad - but Christianity is mitigated by the more peaceful New Testament that a couple of Roman nobles invented; plus more importantly Christianity was forcefully emancipated by Enlightenment and Secularization and so had to jettison its most abject superstitions to survive [in Enlightened Europe].  And no, I'm not ""anti-semitic"" (I don't believe in that silly race crapola), nor ""anti-jew"" (I don't hate ""jews"", as in individuals), I just find the Religion one of the worst on the planet.  I know, Judaism has gotten this ""cute pet"" status, like Hindooism, or Vajrayana, where people close their eyes and refuse to look at the ghouly truth, because it's ""cute"". But if you examine that ""cute pet"" closely...whew.",™

t5_2ve1u,someonewrongonthenet,1381874839,"Live reactions while reading:  1) He was too shy to express his feelings when it mattered.   &gt;One of the final straws was me being in stuck in an LJBF with a person whom i had mad loving feelings for. One day i confessed to her how i felt and told her the pain was just too great for me to bear and i needed a YES OR NO answer. She only wanted to be my friend. I said “you are going to lose that friendship… why not take the chance and give it a try?”  You can't blame ""feminism"" for the fact that you have feelings for someone but just decided to *not fucking tell them* and just let the feelings grow and grow until they are too big to hold...and then drop an ultimatum on the friendship them. From this I presume that the primary problem was that he was *too shy to ask for what he wanted*, not that he was too nice. I'm betting that he was repeating this pattern...getting crushes on women in his life and waiting months or even years to tell them. It's understandable - being open about your feelings takes guts - but it's not anyone else's fault.   2) He discovers that he is able to express his feelings when it *doesn't* matter.  &gt;I was in such a foul mood for having been there and just feeling miserable. So i told the cabby to go to the strip club i was familiar with. Inside i watched a sweet thin Polish girl dancing so i went to perv row. Since i was so angry at the world inside i must have subdued my NiceGuy™ really well, because i went full Dark Triad on this girl, and i had no clue that that term existed at the time.  3) He didn't need *sex* (he didn't even orgasm!) He just wanted validation that he was desirable .  &gt;i actually had to fake my orgasm. I could have kept going. I couldn’t explain it, and i didn’t care to. My confidence level shot up to over 9000.   So he keeps doing this, and now he's built up confidence that he's desirable. He's done this by manipulating insecure girls into bed using ""Dark Triad"" techniques.   4) He's mastered picking up insecure girls, and this unsurprisingly lands him a relationship with his insecure ex-girlfriend.  &gt; ex-girlfriend who later became my wife. She seemed to enjoy quizzing me every so often as to how she compared to those ‘Ladies of the Night’ as she called them, always seeking validation that she stacked up and cut the muster.  5) He delves into the internet.  &gt;That’s when i finally delved into the realm of the internet and discovered about Game, dominance, attraction triggers, evo psych, mra’s, pua’s, the manosphere...**I am not ruled by pussy**  This is the first **positive** development. Everything before this point has been shit. He's finally learning not to tie his self esteem to external validation. I'll go ahead and credit it to TRP  6) But he still feels unfulfilled and angry at life.  &gt;Reading the Rawness made me realize i will not heal my soul by going on a pump n dump spree nor make me a better person. No bandaids on fatal wounds. So now you know where my cynicism and rage comes from.   7) He still hasn't found a fulfilling relationship   ...and...well shit. He's using a mating strategy which attracts insecure women. Married women seem to live him - I'll just *assume* that they aren't polyamorous, so his mating strategy attracts disloyal women. Despite this long story, he's still *never experienced what he actually wanted in the first place - a fulfilling relationship.   &gt;&gt;Let’s just say, the cute chaste and loyal good looking girl i’m looking for, is easier to spot when you **play yourself as the devil** and they don’t fail. This is what i want most.   So...he thinks he's gonna keep doing the dark-triad stuff, and *that* will land him a fulfilling relationship, not like all the other un-fulfilling ones he's having.   Right. Let's just try doing the *same thing we've been doing* and hoping for a different result. I'll give you that TRP-strategy gave him *confidence*, but really *any* serious intellectual attempt at self improvement could have done that. The strategy that TRP advocates is counterproductive to achieving his ultimate goal.",™

Swanson, 4/24/2013""  (http://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/glyphosate/NancySwanson.pdf  The USDA estimates that in 2012, 93% of all soy, 88% of the corn and 94% of the cotton grown in the U.S. was genetically engineered. The USDA only collects GE data on these three crops. The figure below shows the percent change of GE crops planted since 1996. (1996-1999 data: USDA Agricultural Economic Report No. (AER-810) 67 pp, May 2002 2000-2012 data: USDA:NASS National Agricultural Statistics Service http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aer-agricultural-economic-report/ae... &amp; http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID...) (pg. 4)    *Contrary to claims made by the chemical industries, glyphosate use increased 6,504% from 1991 to 2010 according to data from the USDA (http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do;jsessionid=...): National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). States participating in the USDA surveys reported applying a whopping 91,200 tons (1 rail car holds approximately100 tons) of glyphosate on corn, cotton and soy crops alone in 2010 (see graph). Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup™, the herbicide used on Roundup Ready™ crops genetically engineered (GE) to withstand glyphosate. Glyphosate residues of up to 4.4 mg/kg have been detected in stems, leaves and beans of glyphosate-resistant soy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14971683), indicating metabolism of the herbicide. This means that the Roundup Ready™ plants are absorbing the herbicide and you cannot simply wash it off. (pg. 5)   *DATA TRENDS SHOW CORRELATIONS BEWEEN INCREASES IN ORGAN DISEASES AND GMOs...There are many scientific studies showing that glyphosate and the additives in Roundup are toxic to human cells. Below is a list of those most pertinent to this discussion.  *In 2004, Marc et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15182708). reported that GLYPHOSATE-BASED PESTICIDES CAUSE CELL-CYCLE DYSFUNCTION THAT LEADS TO DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER.  *In 2009 Gasnier et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19539684). published an article in the journal Toxicology citing evidence that GLYPHOSATE BASED (G-based) HERBICIDES ARE ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS IN HUMAN CELLS. They reported TOXIC EFFECTS TO LIVER CELLS “at 5 ppm [parts per million], and the first ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING ACTIONS at 0.5 ppm, WHICH IS 800 TIMES LOWER THAN THE LEVEL AUTHORIZED IN SOME FOOD OR FEED (400 ppm, USEPA, 1998). ... In conclusion, ACCORDING TO THESE DATA AND THE LITERATURE, G-based HERBICIDES PRESENT DNA DAMAGES... ON HUMAN CELLS.”  *In 2012 Koller et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22331240). reported that glyphosate and its formulation (Roundup) is TOXIC TO CELLS, PARTICULARLY ORGAN CELLS, and exhibits DNA-damaging properties “ AFTER SHORT EXPOSURE to concentrations that correspond to a 450-fold dilution of spraying used in agriculture.”   *What is often overlooked is the role of “inert” ingredients in glyphosate formulations like Roundup, which have been found to amplify glyphosate toxicity.  *In 2005, Richard et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257596/). reported that “glyphosate is TOXIC TO HUMAN PLACENTAL JEG3 CELLS within 18 hr with concentrations lower than those found with agricultural use, and this effect increases with concentration and time or in the presence of Roundup adjuvants. Surprisingly, Roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredient. ... We conclude that endocrine and toxic effects of Roundup, not just glyphosate, can be observed in mammals.”   *In 2012, Mesnage et al(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X12003459). reported, “This study demonstrates that all the glyphosate-based herbicides tested are more toxic than glyphosate alone ... The formulated herbicides (including Roundup) CAN AFFECT ALL LIVING CELLS, ESPECIALLY HUMAN CELLS. Among them, POE-15 clearly appears to be the most toxic principle against human cells, ... We demonstrate in addition that POE-15 induces necrosis when its first micellization process occurs, by contrast to glyphosate which is known to promote endocrine disrupting effects after entering cells.”' (See Graphs &amp; Charts on pp. 8-14)  DATA SOURCES:  *Diabetes incidence data: CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/incidence/fig1.htm)  *Diabetes prevalence data: CDC(http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figpersons.htm)  *ESRD data: U.S. Renal Data System(http://www.usrds.org/reference.aspx)  *Blood pressure data: CDC (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/brfss/display.asp?cat=HA&amp;yr=2009&amp;qkey=4420&amp;stat...)  *Obesity data: CDC (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/brfss/page.asp?yr=2004&amp;state=UB&amp;cat=OB#OB)  *Acute Kidney Injury: National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse (http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/kustats/index.aspx) (NKUDIC) a service of NIH (public domain).  *Cancer data: National Cancer Institute-Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2009_pops09/browse_csr.php?section=14&amp;pa...)

(http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID...)(pg.15)  *Mounting evidence that GMO crops can cause INFERTILITY AND BIRTH DEFECTS The endocrine disrupting properties of glyphosate can lead to reproductive problems: INFERTILITY, MISCARRIAGE, BIRTH DEFECTS, AND SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT (see notes). FETUSES, INFANTS AND CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE because they are continually experiencing growth and hormonal changes...There are increasing reports of glyphosates and glyphosate formulations causing SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, FEWER BIRTHS AND STERILITY IN LAGABORTORY ANIMALS, FARM ANIMALS AND HUMANS (see notes).  *A Russian study found that feeding hamsters GMO soy resulted in COMPLETE STERILITY AFTER TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS (http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/04/16/6524765.html/). (pg. 16)  NOTES:  *INFERTILITY AND LOW BIRTH RATES:  *Laboratory animals: In 1995 Yousef et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7797819). reported on toxic effects of glyphosate on semen characteristics in rabbits, “Pesticide treatment resulted in a DECLINE IN BODY WEIGHT, LIBIDO, EJACULATE VOLUME, SPERM CONCENTRATION, SEMEN INITIAL FRUCTOSE AND SEMEN OSMOLALITY. This was accompanied with increases in the ABNORMAL AND DEAD SPERM.”  *In 2002 Markaverich et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240732/). found that, “Housing adult rats on ground corncob bedding IMPEDES MALE AND FEMALE MATING BEHAVIOR and CAUSES ACYCLICITY IN FEMALES [not according to regular cycles].”  *In 2008, Austrian researchers found that mice fed GM corn produced FEWER AND SMALLER BABIES than those fed a non-GM diet (http://www.biosicherheit.de/pdf/aktuell/zentek_studie_2008.pdf).  *In April 2010, a Russian study (http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/04/16/6524765.html/)found that after feeding hamsters GM soy for two years over three generations, most were STERILE BY THE THIRD GENERATION.  *2011 Siepmann et al(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353476). reported, “HYPOGONADISM [functional incompetence of the gonads especially in the male with subnormal or impaired production of hormones and germ cells] and ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION associated with soy product  *In 2012 Antoniou et al(http://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/glyphosate/NancySwanson.pdf). published a review of the evidence of the reproductive toxicity of glyphosate herbicides and concluded that a new and transparent risk assessment needs to be conducted.  *In 2012 Irina Ermakova (http://www.regnum.ru/english/526651.html)reported low birth weight and a 55.6% mortality rate in the babies of rats fed GMO soy compared to 6.8% in the control group.  FARM ANIMALS:  *An Iowa pig farmer reports sterility and false pregnancies in pigs fed GMO corn (http://gaia-health.com/gaia-blog/2012-01-23/former-agribusiness-farmer-l...).  *A Danish pig farmer reports birth defects, infertility and low birth rate in pigs fed GMO corn.

They haven't got any such information. They have no inside information about these ""craft"" and what information they present is cobbled together from rumour and pure fiction.    The disclosure project is a scam. This is an unpleasant truth that many people don't want to hear, and in particular sends True Believers™ into a rage, yet it remains a fact.    Greer, for instance, promised the revelation of a working free energy device in 2003 to start manufacture in 2004. Took money from investors, apparently. Where is it?  None of Greer's claims has ever come to fruition or proven to be anything but [grandiose fabrication](http://www.ufowatchdog.com/steven_greer.htm). Steven Greer is, quite simply, a charlatan.  It would absolutely be in the economic interest of a major political power to use free energy technology if they had it. A state actor that controlled such technology would just as surely rule the world as if it had access to weaponry or weapons platforms far in advance of its competitors.   The arguments for the suppression of such technology fall apart on examination, mainly because they are illogical, and also because they come from unfounded sources with no evidence, little apparent understanding of science, and proven hoaxers.   Greer is all of these.",™

That's part of it, but not the whole story... and it's not just minorities. Lots of people want to keep their jobs and privileges even if it undermines society and liberty.  &gt; Are you sure it's not because such a world would be terrible for anyone not already in a position of privilege or power?  That's another part of it, and it's one of the main reasons why I'm a geoist - I want to eliminate privilege (the kind which comes at the expense of others, not the ""fuck you"" kind I listed above). So long as position can't be leveraged to obtain privilege, I suspect inequality will reduce over time.  &gt; Do you think there might be a reason minorities struggle and need things like food stamps?  Yes, and it has to do with the way the state and certain private property norms exist.

If people don't want *Sugar Crusted Rat Feces™* for breakfast that doesn't mean you get to re-name rat feces as ""flavor nuggets"" to trick people into buying it.  Labels should be accurate.  Choice is paramount.  If you have to lie to sell your product then your product has no real demand.  If education is necessary to sell your product get going on the education and watch your sales increase over time as that education is effective.  Don't start by lying and then later try to blame the victims of your deceit for being ignorant.  Educate first and then when people still don't buy rat feces breakfast cereal you can go out of business like the rest of the 99% of businesses that fail.

I also really recommend buying some black acrylic paint so that it doesn't smear after you've done all that work. ,😉

t5_2rrlp,DCNE,1381953004,"either I don't understand what the author is saying, or he is wrong. the relevant bits:  &gt;If you purchase a game on PSN right now with your PlayStation 3, anyone with access to the console has access to the game. The purchasing system on the PS3 is fairly open, allowing you to have the game on multiple consoles with your account setup. This system used to allow for up to five locations for the game to exist, but has since been limited to two. It looks like the PSN on Sony’s next console will decrease that number from two to one, and will also bind the game specifically to your account... &gt; &gt;It also causes a unique new problem for PSN purchases, which will be bound to the account of the user making the purchase. You’d have to either buy the game twice or share your account in order for anyone else to play it. &gt; &gt;This is identical to how the Xbox 360 currently operates, and will be similar to how the Xbox One operates, but is largely a step back for PlayStation users. The Xbox One family sharing system will provide a more functional experience for how things are shared across Xbox Live users, but since those you share with won’t have access to the whole game it’s not a big enough difference to clearly say it is better than Sony’s implementation.  This line, *""This is identical to how the Xbox 360 currently operates, and will be similar to how the Xbox One operates""*, is wrong. You can game share on the Xbox 360, it just takes more forethought to set it up than the PS3. You get two licenses when you buy a download on Xbox 360. One is for the console that downloads it first, and the other is for the account that downloads it. So if you buy a game on your friend's console with your gamertag, and then go home and download it on yours, you can both play it at the same time, each with your own gamertag. You don't have to buy it twice. This may break the terms of service, and Microsoft might not like it, but nevertheless it is how the system currently works on the Xbox 360.  As for PS4 DRM, I sounds like it is either going to work the same as the 360's as I outlined above, or just like the PS3, based on the update of the source article:  &gt;As we reported last night, Knack is now available to pre-order through the SEN Store, and if you look further into that – in the description – you’ll notice a bit of small print regarding how many accounts you can play the game on. &gt; &gt;&gt;One-time license fee for play on purchasing account’s designated, primary PS4™ system and other PS4™ systems when signed in with purchasing account. &gt; &gt;So that means you can’t share the game with your friends or family members, as you were able to on PS3, at least not unless you want them using your account to play the game, but you will be able to play the game on any PS4, just as long as you’re signed into your main account before you do so. &gt; &gt;Essentially then, you’ll only have one system able to play the game on all accounts, rather than the current two you have with PS3, which was recently reduced from five. It’s actually quite similar to how the Xbox 360 currently works in this regard. &gt; &gt;It makes a lot of sense, though if you’re planning to buy two or three PS4s for different family members, then you might have to rethink things when it comes to sharing – you’ll all have to use the same account to play these games. &gt; &gt;What do you think? It seems that this new system is great in certain ways – as you’ll be able to play your games on any PS4 – but also a hinderance if you’re planning to have multiple PS4s in your household. &gt; &gt;UPDATE: Oddly, it also says “One-time license fee for downloads to up to 2 console systems that are associated with the purchasing account.” which could mean that you’re able to use the game on all accounts on two systems, or it could just be leftover terms from the PS3 era, as it contradicts the previous part, and this same section appears in the terms for current games including Tomb Raider.",™

t5_2smr1,longmvu,1381954547,"* Career Mode: - Career Mode is now open! Although still very much under development, you can now start new Career saves. - Sandbox mode, of course, is also available from the start.  * Research and Development: - Added the Research &amp; Development Facility to the Space Center. - R&amp;D allows players to unlock parts (and later other stuff) by researching nodes on the Tech Tree (In Career Mode).  * Science: - Researching requires Science, which must be earned by performing experiments during your missions. - You can now collect surface samples while on EVA, and process them to do Science. - Science experiments return results, which are different for each situation in which the experiment is performed.  - Experiments can (as all proper experiments must) be repeated over many different situations across the whole Solar System.  - Added a new dialog to show the results of experiments when reviewing the collected data. - Added a new dialog to show a breakdown of all scientific progress made after recovering a mission.  * Parts:  - Added new scientific parts, like the Materials Bay and the Mystery Goo™ Canister. Also added experiments to many existing parts. - The old science sensors now have a purpose. They all have their own experiments which enable them to log scientific data. - The antennas are now functional, and can be used to transmit science data back to Kerbin, if recovering the physical experiments is not an option. - Antennas consume massive amounts of power when transmitting. Make sure you have fresh batteries in. - Added a new deployable antenna, which is an intermediate model compared to the two original ones. - Completely remodelled the Communotron 88-88 Comms Dish. The new mesh uses the same placement rules so it won't break ships that have it. - Nose Cones now actually help with improving stability during atmospheric flight. - Revised a lot of part values and descriptions, in preparation for them actually meaning something in the near future. - Overhauled the landing legs and gears, they now have proper shock-absorbing suspensions.  * Editor: - Added a system to allow saving and loading of Sub-Assemblies. - Subassemblies are subsets of spacecraft, which can later be attached to other designs and re-used.  * Space Center: - The KSC Facilities have all been revised, and feature new ground meshes and many other graphical improvements. - Greatly improved the Island Airfield.  - Added lighting FX to several facilities. The Runway (among many other things) is now properly lit at night. - Added a new backdrop and soundtrack for the Astronaut Complex Facility. - Added a new music track for the R&amp;D Facility.  * Flight: - It is now possible to recover a flight after landing/splashdown on Kerbin without going through the Tracking Station. Look above the Altimeter. - The SAS system was again largely overhauled, based on all the feedback we've gotten from everyone. It's now stabler than ever.  * Solar System: - Celestial Bodies now support Biome Maps, which are used to create different conditions for experiments.  - Biomes are currently implemented on Kerbin and on the Mun, more will be added on later updates.  * Launcher: - We've got a new launcher application for KSP, featuring a news bulletin, patcher management, and also allows you to tweak settings from outside the game.  * Windows and OSX Installers: - The KSPStore version of the game can now also be downloaded as an installer wizard on Windows, and as a .dmg image on OSX.  * Bug Fixes and Tweaks: - Fixed an issue that caused a stream of errors to be thrown after planting a flag and opening the map. - Fixed several minor and not-so-minor issues with scene transitions. - Greatly improved the scene transition times. Loading delays between scenes should be significantly reduced. - The SAS indicator on the UI now changes colors to indicate when your input is overriding it.",™

t5_2qi0a,dcfedor,1381955764,"First of all, I want to say kudos for digging into the data, and giving it an honest shake. (Upvote for your rigor!) You're right that good data is hard to find on the subject. As an industry, we have a really poor grasp of measuring productivity, so it's hard to prove or disprove whether overtime affects productivity.  The Revay Report (i.e. ""meta report"") is probably the closest in message to your comment, as it primarily finds that productivity decreases ""some amount"" over time when working overtime. They cite numerous sources of data, but caution that the data isn't rigorous enough to quantify.  There are other studies from more established sources, which may be more like what you're looking for:  [Effect of overtime work on cognitive function in automotive workers](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40966520?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102784784393) Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health © 1996 &gt;""The findings support the hypothesis that overtime work results in impaired cognitive performance in the areas of attention and executive function...""  [Investigating the Associations among Overtime Work, Health Behaviors, and Health: A Longitudinal Study among Full-time Employees](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-010-9103-z) International Journal of Behavioral Medicine December 2011 &gt;""The relation between overtime and ill health is partly accounted for by the unhealthy lifestyle in which overworkers tend to engage. However, a direct longitudinal effect of overtime on health suggested that the effects of overtime on health may also partly be due to the sustained physiological activation that results from working overtime. Whereas working a moderate amount of overtime does not usually entail major health risks, these will increase with increasing overtime.""  [Impact of Overtime and Stress on Software Quality](http://www.iiis.org/CDs2008/CD2008SCI/MEI2008/PapersPdf/M205IP.pdf) 4th International Symposium on Management, Engineering, and Informatics: MEI 2008 &gt;""The overtime hours were seen as a reliable indicator of stress on the project team members and the level of defects was seen as an output of the stress on the project team members.""  [Voluntary or involuntary? Control over overtime and rewards for overtime in relation to fatigue and work satisfaction](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02678370801984927#.Ul70t1B6aXE) Work &amp; Stress: An International Journal of Work, Health &amp; Organisations 2008 &gt;""It can be concluded that control over overtime and rewards for overtime are important for well-being. Moderate overtime work may not be a problem if it is done voluntarily. Moreover, the negative effects of compulsory overtime work may be partly offset by fair compensation for the extra work.""  Full disclosure: I haven't purchased nor read these entirely. They're just an hour's worth of poking around for more sources.  Also, you're right that not all jobs are created equal. Construction and auto industry workers are going to see different results from overtime than an IT worker. However, it seems that even the auto industry study suggests a diminishing in cognitive performance, and not just physical fatigue in making widgets.  I still intend to champion more responsible use of overtime, to the extinction of ""crunch."" Mostly as a result of my first-hand experience (i.e. anecdotal). However, I welcome any solid data that can be brought to bear, including that which disproves the ""crunch is bad"" hypothesis!  EDIT: ""exclusion"" to ""extinction."" I meant to say that I want ""crunch"" to go away (i.e. sustained, unpaid overtime)",©

We got married!  ##We never would have imagined waking up this morning that we’d be husband and wife by the end of the day, we were planning the whole ceremony for next summer. But life works in unexpected ways, and sometimes an opportunity comes along and you just have to go for it. We were sitting around on Skype chatting with the minister who we were planning to have perform our wedding ceremony next summer, bemoaning the financial issues we were struggling with surrounding the guests and catering, renting a tuxedo (Twi’s wedding gown was already taken care of), the rings, and everything else that goes into planning a wedding. We weren’t sure how we could ever possibly pull it off on my college student budget, and then Twi once again (as she had done several times before) reminded me that she didn’t care about having a fancy dress or a big event with lots of fanfare. The only thing that was really important to her was that we’d always be together, and making that commitment to each other was all that really mattered.  ###At that point the minister brought up that if we wanted he could actually perform the ceremony over webcam rather than having to travel from his home country of Sweden to America to do it, the doctrines of the Universal Life Church do allow him to do that. Then before I even had a chance to think about the matter Twi blurted out “Then lets do it!”. I just grinned at her and said “You really want to?”, to which Twilight replied “Of course! It’s much more financially efficient than having an extravagant wedding ceremony and I’ve already told you I don’t care about all the trappings. My family in Equestria isn’t going to be able to attend anyway. All that really matters is that we love each other and know we want to spend the rest of our lives together”. I didn’t even have to think it over, she was right.  ####And like that, the ceremony began. The minister gave his speech, I held Twilight’s hooves in my hands, and when the time came we each said our “I do”s and kissed. It all went by so fast I could hardly catch my breath, and before either of us knew it we were husband and wife. Not in a way that would be recognized by the state, nor in a way that would be recognized by most of society, but under the authority of the Universal Life Church and, most importantly of all, in our hearts we were now married. The official wedding rings and the honeymoon will come later, but for the ceremony our engagement rings served just fine and we’ve still got most of a semester of college to go before we can take a honeymoon. Besides, our official wedding rings are going to be custom machined from a meteorite and those will take quite some time to craft. We should have them by the time our honeymoon comes around though. But for today those weren’t needed. Today all that was required was that we make a joyous commitment to each other in witness of our minister, and for him to recognize and validate that commitment. Our marriage certificate will be arriving in the mail in the not too distant future.  #####This wedding turned out absolutely nothing like either of us ever imagined it would be, completely non-traditional in every way. And yet, we both feel exactly the same way we always knew we would feel afterwards. Absolutely elated! I don't think either of us could possibly feel any happier than we do today. Best day of both of our lives, hands and hooves down!  ######I write to you now not just as someone on the internet named Matthew (or Jin as many have come to know me), but as Twilight Sparkle’s husband.

[See Rule 1.4] - See more at: http://www.cfp.net/for-cfp-professionals/professional-standards-enforcement/compliance-resources/frequently-asked-questions/fiduciary-duty#sthash.ffdV58tz.dpuf  Note that the definition of ""providing financial planning services"" is somewhat vague, the best way to ensure your CFP has fiduciary duty to you is to ask.  Regardless, even a CFP who is a fiduciary may still have a conflict of interest if they work on commission. This [WSJ article on choosing a financial planner](http://guides.wsj.com/personal-finance/managing-your-money/how-to-choose-a-financial-planner/) is a good place to start to understand how advisers may have conflicts of interest.",®

If we can get the MacBook Pro retina display shrunken down to the size of the oculus rift display (possible in a few months maybe?) then we should see a huge improvement.

t5_2ss5b,onetwotheepregnant,1381975015,"Lol. I had better not light a cigarette, otherwise all that straw you have might catch on fire. And here I thought I was having a discussion in good faith, sillie me. Or were you planning on citing sources for   &gt;a woman who has ingested any amount of alcohol is no longer able to consent to anything therefore you raped her.   I'm quite sure that it's nothing myself or any of the intersectional feminists I am good friends with believe. Remember that thing I said about people having agency? So, yeah, you're a joke already, fighting monsters that only exist in your own head. Besides that, I never said *I* kissed *her.*   &gt;And because you were friends first, that shows you're obviously a ""nice guy"" creep who only wanted to be friends with her so he could have sex. If you hadn't been friends beforehand, you would've just been a creepy pervert who wanted sex. Welcome to feminist thought.  A Nice Guy™ is not someone who has friends of the opposite sex. A Nice Guy™ is a person (usually male) who expects that just being nice will get them the girl of their dreams, and then acts like a petulant child when they find that women are not vending machines that you can just insert niceness into, and receive sex from. In other words, they aren't nice people at all. Their niceness is insincere because they expect something in return.   And it's quite easy to approach women you don't know without being a ""creep."" Try respecting people's boundaries and social norms, it's really not that difficult. ",™

t5_2s453,Fire_in_the_nuts,1381975895,"Hi! I'm the resident SCD whack-a-loon!  No secret handshake; it either works or it doesn't. [Some data](http://www.mdheal.org/crohn%27s.htm) to suggest its utility:  &gt;RESULTS: All 20 patients demonstrated a decrease in symptoms and reduction in medication use. Six patients have entered complete clinical remission, discontinued all medication, and maintained remission for five to 80 months. The most rapid response in this category belongs to a 28 year old male who presented with daily fevers of 40 degrees C, bloody diarrhea six times per day, a serum albumen of 2.6 g/dl, ESR of 90 and oxalic acid excretion of 164mg per day, despite the use of azathioprine 100 mg per day and prednisone 40mg per day. This patient achieved complete clinical and laboratory remission during the first 60 days and has maintained remission for three years. For the remaining 14 patients, reduction in symptoms scores were from 90 percent to 40percent (mean reduction of 65 percent). Mean prednisone dose (6 patients) decreased from 17 mg to 5 mg, mean dose of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (3patients) decreased from 100 mg per day to 33 mg per day, mean dose of5-aminosalicylate preparations was reduced by 33 percent, mean ESR decreased from 66 to 32, mean serum albumen increased from 3.2 g/dl to 4.1 g/dl and mean intestinal permeability index (differential lactulose/mannitol absorption) decreased from 0.275 to 0.074. Eleven patients responded to the initial SCDand nine proceeded to other dietary interventions. All nine returned non-glutenous starches to their diets. Yeast illumination was the diet of choice for five, complete milk limitation for five, and elimination of nuts for four. Sixteen patients received fish oil supplements, 9 received glutamine and MPS supplements.  Similarly, there's a new pediatric study out- still only [E-pub ahead of print.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24048168)  &gt;Seven children with Crohn's on the SCD™ and on no immunosuppressive medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from five months to thirty months, with an average of 14.6 ± 10.8 months. Although the exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review, all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit three months after initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, C - reactive protein, hematocrit and stool calprotectin, either normalized or significantly improved during follow-up clinic visits. This chart review suggests that the SCD™ and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn's disease. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD™, or any other low complex specific carbohydrate diets in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.  I personally favor a low-carb diet with lots of SCD-type yogurt. See also Lutz's ""Life Without Bread,"" including the chapter with charts on its efficacy in managing colitis.  That said, plenty of books are out there with suggestions as to how to use diet as a complementary approach to managing IBD; I have heard good things about Hunter's ""[Inflammatory Bowel Disease,](http://www.amazon.com/Inflammatory-Bowel-Disease-Essential-Controlling/dp/0091935083)"" but have yet to read it. Similarly, there are a handful of ""Paleo"" diet books, all of which exclude grains much like Gottschall's SCD. I would opine that fermented foods would be good to add to *any* IBD diet, and Katz's [Art of Fermentation](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Fermentation--Depth-Exploration-Essential/dp/160358286X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381975696) would be another useful reference.  There are also vegetarian/vegan approaches, about which I know much less.  As of December, I'll have been on 100% diet-controlled Crohn's (biopsy-confirmed) for 6 years with no meds. No symptoms, blood panels and fecal calprotectin are all well within norms.",™

Take for example the many tablet-pcs that are Wacom enabled. I'm using an HP-TM2 at the moment, which doesn't offer as many levels of pressure as a Cintiq 13HD, but it has what I need to do some light graphics work and some handwriting recognition. The Wacom digitizer on my HP TM2 recognizes 512 levels of pressure compared to the 13HD's 2048 levels of pressure.  Or consider the Samsung Galaxy Note series of Android Tablets and Phablets, all of which have Wacom digitizers.

The Tab model also has .5 GB less ram and a dual core processor instead of a quad core. So it would seem that the Wacom digitizer doesn't account for the full $100 price difference.

t5_2qh21,edwardog,1381979442,"&gt;I have spoken to a couple of companies using Ruby/Rails and they said scaling and performance have to be designed into the application.   Yes, but I’d say that’s the case for anything WebScale™  &gt; They say I have to use a lot of caching and non Ruby back end services to get any kind of scale and performance.   It depends. I once watched some programmers look at a Ruby program that was parsing some input, and say “Oh man, the slow part here is in the regex parsing bit. Let’s rewrite this in Go to make it faster!”  What happened was that they rewrote it in Go, and then found it to be the same speed. Why? Because Ruby uses a compiled C-based library for its regex engine, which was the same thing the Go program ended up using.  That having been said, Ruby can be pretty slow at some execution paths of programs. In those cases, you will typically do one or some of these things:  * Not care; if it’s 10x as fast, it doesn’t really matter * Rewrite the slow part in a compiled language or one with a kickass JIT compiler and call it from Ruby via FFI or a network layer like HTTP (which involves a server/client, etc.) * Reframe the problem so it can be solved with a concurrent algorithm and spend CPUs until your performance problem goes away  &gt; In addition, I will be doing a lot of data analysis and rule based actions on inputs. What are experienced Ruby developers using for these kinds of back ends?   This is still pretty general, but you might want to look into something like SciRuby.  &gt; What are the integration points? Do I route requests using a reverse proxy or are there better ways to integrate with Rails/Ruby. I know there must be some good articles on building a scaleable well performing Ruby app, any suggestions?  * You only need Rails to build an MVC web application; look at Sinatra or just Rack if your web-interaction needs are not a big deal * It sounds like you are probably going to spending most of your time writing analysis libraries; you won’t need Rails there other than to display results * You will only need reverse proxies if you need to serve more than one request concurrently * Some Rails web servers like Passenger will perform the reverse proxy pool thing for you  Godspeed and please write tests.",™

t5_2qhhk,crank1000,1381989217,"The problem is there isn't a genetic marker that says ""Lab"" or ""Boxer"" etc. If they even do the tests, all they would be able to tell is descriptors like ""brachicephalic nose"" and ""short hair"". They can put together a best guess based on all the markers, but it's never going to be accurate. In fact, their website states they won't even test pure breeds.   &gt;Will Wisdom Panel® 2.0 mixed-breed analysis test for purebred dogs? &gt;No. Mars Veterinary’s current focus is the development of a state-of-the-art mixed-breed genetic identification test for dogs. Mars Veterinary has completed over 19 million genetic marker analyses and has typed over 13,000 dogs from the American Kennel Club (AKC) registered purebred dogs as well as mixed-breed dogs. This process gave Mars Veterinary the ability to distinguish between a purebred and a mixed-breed dog as well as the capability of identifying breeds present within a mixed-breed dog.  &gt;However, in order to identify a dog as an official or registered purebred, the DNA collection, analysis and development of the test would be much different. A purebred is defined as a canine that is bred from members of a specific or registered breed over many generations. Validation of purebreds and what constitutes a purebred is a job for kennel clubs such as the American Kennel Club (AKC).  This is also super suspicious:  &gt;Why doesn't my dog look like the breeds detected by the Wisdom Panel® 2.0?  &gt;Physical appearance is largely controlled by a small number of genes. These genes can have both recessive and dominant variants and the variants that are present determine the visible effect on physical traits seen. As a result the presence of various breed signatures does not guarantee that the dog will look like all detected breeds - a wonder of genetic inheritance can be seen as much in people as in dogs.  Lastly, if they even do run the test, this would be extremely easy to test for:  &gt;Can Wisdom Panel® 2.0 determine the sex of the dog tested?  &gt;Wisdom Panel® 2.0 is specifically designed to look for the combination of ancestral breed(s) in a dog utilizing the non-sex chromosomes, and therefore, it cannot determine the sex of a dog at this time.",®

Or just squat with a dumbbell (either normal stance or goblet). But excluding that, it sounds like you are wanting to increase your calf size which the other poster addressed.

t5_2sdu8,VegettoEX,1382014788,"&gt; I know the creator of DBZ was quoted in saying ""power levels were only introduced to show how pointless they are""  Err... actually, that was me :). I mean, Toriyama might say a similar thing, but the way you phrased that statement is almost verbatim from the statement I made and was quoted in during ScrewAttack's Goku vs. Superman video.  For what it's worth, here's just one portion of the explanation I provided to them, which in turn helps answer this question:  &gt; The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were. The villains kept underestimating the heroes because the numbers meant diddly-squat and they didn’t realize it yet. And what exactly are they measuring, anyhow? Do they take into consideration the person's speed, courage, friendship, tenacity, genius, etc.? You know, all the things that make our heroes overcome all the obstacles in their way? ☺  Reducing Dragon Ball down to ""Number VS Number"" does a complete disservice to the message that Toriyama is trying to deliver with the stories he tells, and does so by way of Goku himself: there are always obstacles to overcome, you are capable of overcoming them, and don't let anyone tell you differently.",☺

t5_2th52,utahphil,1382017730,"You might want to see this.  You recently listened to a webcast on Inovio Pharmaceuticals. We appreciate your time to learn more about Inovio and our vital role in advancing the field of DNA vaccines and immunotherapies.  Inovio’s vision is to expand the significant medical benefits of the 20th century’s vaccines by creating synthetic DNA vaccines and immunotherapies to not only prevent challenging diseases but treat cancers and infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.  Our SynCon® vaccines, in combination with our proprietary electroporation delivery, are generating best-in-class immune responses, with therapeutic T-cell responses exceeding other technologies. Inovio's lead immunotherapy, VGX-3100, is a therapeutic against HPV-caused pre-cancers and cancers. Data from this study indicated that the T-cells VGX-3100 generated were able to kill targeted diseased cells. We expect top-line efficacy data from our phase II study of this immunotherapy in subjects with late stage cervical pre-cancers in mid-2014. This will be the first efficacy data from our platform and could be transformational not just for Inovio but for the whole field of DNA-based therapies.  Inovio has also reported best-in-class T-cell responses from a human study of a DNA vaccine for HIV, in which our vaccine achieved a seven-fold increase (7% to 52%) in response rate of CD8 T-cells when delivered with electroporation. This type of data has never been previously reported by anyone else.  Our best-in-class T-cell responses have attracted the eyes of Big Pharma. We recently announced a partnership with Roche, a global leader in innovative cancer drugs, to develop and commercialize Inovio’s prostate cancer (INO-5150) and hepatitis B (INO-1800) immunotherapies. Roche’s stated aim is to find first-in-class and best-in-class therapies that may become next generation treatments for patients with different types of cancer. This partnership provides validation of Inovio’s novel technology for treating and preventing diseases, provides non-dilutive funding, and allows us to accelerate our product development pipeline.  In September, 2013, we announced that a new application using Inovio’s DNA technology to produce monoclonal antibodies achieved excellent results compared to conventional monoclonal antibody technology, while offering various advantages by being DNA-based.  In the next quarters, Inovio plans to start phase I and phase I/IIa clinical trials for immunotherapies designed to treat prostate cancer, breast and lung cancers displaying the antigen hTERT, other HPV-caused cancers, HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B, most of these studies being funded by third parties.  We are excited about Inovio’s results and potential on its path to revolutionize vaccines. Please let me know if you have questions.

I drew it late at night, sleep-deprived.  **Hands.**  Tutorial clearly states, that *balls* can't have hands, but the ones I drew don't belong to balls. Limbs [were](http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1h2deo/japans_ghost/) pictured before. But mostly: I wanted to show interaction with a God, and there's no ""right"" way to show that. Not many comics tried to do that, and there is no ""canon"" way. A popular approach in world's modern media is to show God as an abstract being. For countryballs, hands may be abstract.  **What's happening.**  Unrest around the Globe is pictured. Tibet doesn't engage in the drama. There are military, economic and religious conflicts &amp; races to power. Tibet doesn't care… up to some point, when it looses its shit and shouts at everyone. Then, God appears, and chooses Tibet to be the best™ country, the first (but only?) to attain *ascension.*  Interpretation of my picturing of ascension – I leave to the readers.  BUT: I certainly was influenced by one of visions of a technological singularity, one in which Humanity, or a part of it, merges together psychically and/or physically into one, superior being, possibly far different from today's life – a God?  One, more alien, vision of such a merged being is *a thinking liquid or aerosol* – an example of media picturing such vision is Japanese animu, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, with its *LCL* (which by chance also happens to be an orange liquid).",™

And  &gt;Airsoft Silencer Laws  &gt;The GCA defines the term “firearm” as: A.) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; B.) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; © any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or D.) any destructive device.

t5_2vlui,invincible_spleen,1382021322,"Dungeon World is fantastic and I will gush about it every opportunity I get. What's really important to remember if you're used to D&amp;D is that the fiction is everything. Mechanics simply facilitate the fiction.  Say you want to use the Hack and Slash move:  &gt; When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+Str. ✴On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. ✴On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.  You don't say 'I use the Hack and Slash move on the goblin', you'd say 'I raise my shield and charge the creature, swinging my sword at its head!' - which would trigger the mechanics for Hack and Slash. Think of it like this: In Dungeon World, to do it, do it.  Fiction's primacy applies to more than just moves, though. Monsters and items have descriptions and tags, which are descriptive words that may or may not have direct mechanical effects, but affect the fiction in a big way. Your shield isn't just +1 Armour, it's a shield! You can block arrows with it! You can push people around! Your dwarven warhammer has the messy and forceful tags, but they don't add dice to your rolls, they mean your warhammer splatters small enemies into giblets and knocks larger ones flying!  A great example that illustrates how this works is [the story of the 16 HP dragon](http://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/) that nearly wiped a party.  The book is [available online for free](http://book.dwgazetteer.com/), but [a hard copy](http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=18774) is well worth the $25.",✴

The overwhelming majority of Nice Guys probably aren't even aware that their reasoning and what they're doing is flawed and disrespectful. It starts with men simply being intimidated by women. Many of these guys don't know how to effectively approach women and they aren't assertive or interesting, so they fall back on the fairy tale script that ""as long as I'm an amazing and great friend who is always there for her, she'll eventually see how wonderful I am and we'll live happily ever after, etc. etc."" It's pathetic and undesirable, but not necessarily malicious. It's when this plan fails again and again, that frustration and resentment builds up and the guy begins to think that he's entitled to a woman's love as a transaction for being the target of his affection and care. He isn't aware of the sick flaw in his reasoning because in his mind it's innocuous: ""I'm a nice guy, why don't women like me?"" and ""It's so true, nice guys do finish last."" But he really does behave as though a woman's rejection is a breach of contract. The Nice Guy is delusional and wrong, just not consciously so.""",♂

t5_2r6bz,bakhtiyar_bbb,1382027882,"There you go - a readable font  ▶I mean, I’m a fan of Eminem. I’m a fan first and foremost. Maybe before I wouldn’t have challenged him, but I’m contemplating it now. - Rick Ross  ▶He rhymes about rhyming. He rhymes about how well he rhymes, and he rhymes about bragging about how well he rhymes, because, well, he can. - HipHopDX  ▶Eminem’s rhyme patterns are super dope and he can squeeze a million words in a couple bars. Crazy creative. His voice changes alot though. - Chamillionaire  ▶Who is the best rapper ever? I’ll probably have to say Eminem. I would definitely say Eminem. He came from a whole another culture, literally. Mastered it, outsold everybody and he did every kind of record imaginable. He could take any topic and make a song out of it. I haven’t seen any artist do that yet. - Akon  ▶Come on out. I’m not calling you out to diss me because I can’t fuck with you. But come do a song. Please…with three e’s. - Lil Wayne  ▶Eminem = Greatness. - Drake  ▶I was obsessed with Eminem when I was younger. When he first came out I was about 12 and fanatical about his ‘Slim Shady’ CD. I think he’s a genius. - Robert Pattison  ▶Everytime I listen to Eminem I fall in love with music all over again. - Hayley Williams  ▶Why would I diss Eminem, the illest lyricist on the fucking planet? What the fuck do I stand to gain by dissing the biggest rapper in the country? How could that help me? And for the record, I do think Em’ is a better rapper then me, but he ain’t writing no record about me, because regardless of what goes down, trust me, Em’ knows what I am capable of lyrically. - Royce da 5’9  ▶From the start, I’ve always admired Eminem’s thinking. That’s the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked. Eminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. That’s very necessary today in America, with people being muzzled and irony becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just aren’t many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome. - Elton John  ▶I am still in shock. I never really thought you’d do a record with me. I didn’t even think you’d know who I was. Thank you for your passion. Thank you for getting on the phone with me and treating me like your peer. I didn’t expect that at all. You have no idea how much that means. You are the most down to earth and humble artist of your caliber I’ve had the pleasure of working with. God bless you and your family. And happy belated B-day. - Nicki Minaj  ▶You notice out of everyone I’ve ever talked about I NEVER fucked with Em’ and I NEVER will. When he’s pissed off, he ain’t gonna punch you in the mouth and he probably can’t beat you up, but he’s gonna fuck you up. You don’t fuck with that crazy white boy. - The Game  ▶I started off thinking Eminem was a flash in the pan, a kind of hip-hop Hanson brother. How wrong I was. Recovery is sometimes funny, sometimes terrible, always painfully honest. The matching of Eminem and Rihanna on “Love the Way You Lie” is pure genius. “Not Afraid” is pretty great too. - Stephen King  ▶Some of Eminem’s rap songs kind of have the teenage love songs like the Fifties love songs. It’s kind of like domestic drama set to music. He is really good storyteller. - Bruce Dickinson  ▶The great thing about Eminem is, he’s just hysterical. You forget, people like Eminem because he is riotously funny. And he’s a great actor. - Judd Apatow  ▶You know the world is messed up when the tallest man in the NBA is chinese, the best golfer is black, and the best rapper is white. - Chris Rock  ▶He(Eminem) has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy. - Seamus Heaney  ▶He’s (Eminem’s) the best comic sort of writer or storyteller that has come around in memory. - Randy Newman  ▶Rap to me is a modern blues. But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it — and thank God. - Stevie Wonder  ▶What is the big deal about Eminem? Since when is offensive language a reason for being unpopular? I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect. At least he has an opinion. He’s stirring things up. He’s provoking a discussion. He’s making people’s blood boil. He’s reflecting what’s going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do. - Madonna  ▶If anyone takes it too seriously(Eminem’s lyrics), it’s not too cool. I like Stan. - Paul McCartney  ▶Toronto, I want you to make some motherfucking noise for the Greatest of all time, Eminem. - Drake  ▶Em’ reminds me of one of my friends from back home. It was just so natural. I forgot in two seconds that he was the biggest-selling artist of the decade. He knows what he’s doing. - Alex Da Kid  ▶I feel like it’s not fair, because [Em] can do so many different things with his voice. Everybody did they verse already. Em did his verse first, Royce heard it first, did his second, then Crook did his, and then Em rewrote his…Joell’s is done — but I think he might be rewriting his…It wouldn’t be as difficult to do a song with Jay-Z, because he’s just an incredible rapper. Eminem, he can give you 20 different voices, he can to 20 million different things in a verse. It’s not really about incredible rapping with him. It’s more than rapping with Eminem. - Joe Budden  ▶He (Em’) fucked him (Jay-Z) awfully on that record. (Renegade) Completely. Like DAMN! I don’t want Eminem on my album. I’m cool. - Snoop Dogg  ▶In a time like this, when records are not selling, he’s the only one that is selling. You know, Drake and all the other ones [did well], but Em did [close to] 800,000 his first week, and he’s #1 for the fifth week. It’s incredible. I think he has a faithful fan base of people who have been following him for years. They’re not going to stop following him and not stop listening to his music. Em’ said he didn’t like his last album as much as this one. You can hear the difference. I like both of the albums. ‘3 a.m.’ is one of my joints. But Eminem has followers that’s gonna mess with him until the day he dies. - Tony Yayo  ▶I don’t know how this is possible because I’ve been listening to Eminem since I was, you know, 3, and Usher is my mentor. This is big. - Justin Bieber  ▶Where’s Eminem? I’m in love with him. Eminem. Couldn’t relate to this song (Talking To Myself) more some days. - Lindsay Lohan  ▶I am a huge Eminem fan and find it flattering that he would rap about me. Personally, I’m honored. - Kim Kardashian  ▶Wow. He(Eminem) is a genius. I love how his music tells a story. His music means something. He is a living legend. - Miley Cyrus  ▶If he keeps doing what he does now, he will be bigger than Michael Jackson. Some of the hardest nikkas I know think this little white boy is great. Em’ is an incredible artist. - Dr.Dre  ▶Nobody wants to fuck with him(Eminem) when we talk about music. - P. Diddy  ▶He(Eminem) is the most exciting rapper out there. - Missy Elliot  ▶As if the song(Airplanes II) couldn’t get any better. He just slays me, he’s such a genius. - Hayley Williams  ▶Eminem is like the godfather of rap. - Tony Yayo  ▶Technically, Eminem is the most skilled rapper I’ve ever heard. - DJ Khalil   ▶I think he’s [Eminem] a very intelligent rapper. I couldn’t imagine being that successful. I mean, he’s a guy who loves rap and wanted to be successful his whole career. Then he finally gets it. - Jay-Z  ▶(I love Eminem.) He is one of my favorite artists. Absoulutely. - Rihanna  ▶I think he’s (Eminem’s) one of the most poetic, ballsy and hilarious people this industry has ever seen. - P!nk  ▶Out of all the artist i worked with he was the most involved. - Nicki Minaj   ▶I think he’s one of the greatest lyricists around. I think the guy’s a freaking lyrical genius! - Queen Latifah  ▶To be able to break into an African-American game, I would have to take my hat off to him for that. - Master P  ▶His (Eminem’s) wordplay can’t be matched. If you listen to him; it’s sick! It’s ill, it has cancer [and] it has AIDS; that’s how sick it is! - Tech N9ne  ▶You dont fuck with the white boy, Jay knows, everybody knows. I love Em’. He’s dope hes always been dope and as far as any type of lyrical war the guy, I dont think anyone can beat him. - The Game  ▶I think that’s one of the most exciting things hip hop can look forward to. He (Eminem) contributes so much lyrically and musically, he’s amazing. - Nas  ▶I can’t fuck with Eminem. - Lupe Fiasco  ▶Eminem is the greatest, ever. - Akon   ▶Nobody’s﻿ gonna be bigger than Eminem. - Kanye West  ▶Air Jordan. Tiger Woods. You know how a person is made for something? Eminem is made for hip-hop. The best rapper is a white man. - 50 Cent ",▶

t5_2qmd0,justdionysus,1382034353,"I agree with the original paper -- the source accounts for this but it's hard to see due to the organization of the two different platforms groups (win and everything else).  I took a quick look at the Windows binary for the ""TrueCrypt Format.exe"" and it appears to work according to the source. That said, I only took a quick look during my lunch break.  For anyone that cares, I'll point out what I saw in the source for each platform.  I was using the latest source (7.1a) and the referenced Windows binary (7.0a).  **For Windows:**  `Common\Volumes.c`      1019 BOOL WriteEffectiveVolumeHeader (BOOL device, HANDLE fileHandle, byte *header)  This doesn't write any excess above the effective volume size.      // Writes randomly generated data to unused/reserved header areas.     // When bPrimaryOnly is TRUE, then only the primary header area (not the backup header area) is filled with random data.     // When bBackupOnly is TRUE, only the backup header area (not the primary header area) is filled with random data.     int WriteRandomDataToReservedHeaderAreas (HANDLE dev, CRYPTO_INFO *cryptoInfo, uint64 dataAreaSize, BOOL bPrimaryOnly, BOOL bBackupOnly)  This writes random data (by encrypting zeros with a random key, I think) to the reserved areas of one or both headers.  I found this function hard to read.  That while(TRUE) loop, for example, seems like an odd way to do it.  That said, I've written worse code.  `Common\Format.c`      558         nStatus = WriteRandomDataToReservedHeaderAreas (dev, cryptoInfo, dataAreaSize, FALSE, FALSE);  This calls the above after doing the effective header write.  This is what is called from the format wizard.  **For Linux:**  `Volume/VolumeHeader.cpp`      45     void VolumeHeader::Create (const BufferPtr &amp;headerBuffer, VolumeHeaderCreationOptions &amp;options)  This writes the entire header to headerBuffer including the zeroed reserved area.

t5_2r9po,Armchair_Tycoon,1382035320,"QAs have direct interaction with the developers (generally).I think this may be a case of awful testing, even perhaps blind testing without much documentation, even perhaps not enough scenarios. (I really did not want to conclude to this :/) I say that based on the list of bugs accumulated...For example, a bug or new feature is completed; the ""Bug"" or ""Story"" would generally have the changes made.  -Depending on the complexity a smoke test is needed, even perhaps a full regression is ensued. If over all changes are also made, then test cases are supposed to be written; or at the very least key scenarios that would affect most of the players.In the case of the Engineer turret, if the (hypothetical) damage is buffed to 33% and/or additional features are added, and say with a 45-sec cool down.. I imagine most QAs would test the damage increase under normal situations -- with buffs (say Might from Eles), with banners (from Warriors), under different Armor/Trinkets/Weapon stats, including runes/sigils etc.If there is a cool down, then you also need to make sure it is happening correctly, not earlier or longer.A video game is much harder to test against a web application (like blogging). The game may have so many scenarios, but it should not be terribly hard to at least verify the happy paths plus some negativity behavior.Obviously they have their own methods, and for the players sake I'd imagine they would have different environments to verify said features &amp; bugs, including a copy of ""Production"" to test against prior to deployment.Those are my 2 cents 😶",😶

t5_2s30g,LemonFrosted,1382036543,"The trouble with the question is that a lot of the mental issues that boys go through with puberty won't apply because you have the benefit of almost a decade more life experience and perspective.  The sort of shame, confusion, egocentrism, hostility that generally come with puberty are as much a product of the kind of world 12 year olds live in as it is a product of the hormones. Your peer groups as an adult are (hopefully) vastly different from middle school, and you've (again, hopefully) realized that high school is not the Defining Moment of Life™.  With that in mind, you'll probably find yourself trying to brute-force problems and generally being more physical with people around you.

Display resolutions up to 1920×1200, multi-core processors, Windows® 7, and anti-aliasing in 3D planetary battles are now fully supported.  - Extended soundtrack means you’ll hear more than 15 completely new musical themes specially created for deeper immersion into the amazing Space Rangers universe.  - Other improvements include more than 10 new text adventures, 15+ planetary battle maps, 20+ government missions, unique non-story events, new equipment and micromodules, access to all hyperspace engagements from the main menu and more!",®

Naturally make sure your dorfs are wearing/equipped with full armor; helm, chest, gloves, pants and boots AND a cloak.

t5_2yfr0,Jirni,1382046516,"Sorry for the delayed response, tis the season to get pummeled by a cold or flu.   I have a few issues with the ""Color Run"" and it's not all on a racial level I promise. While a portion of proceeds may be given to charity, one has to wonder, how much is a ""portion""? In some cases, it's as low as 2% of the total take from registration and merchandise sales. No matter how you slice it, The Color Run LLC is a strictly for profit organization. For the same reason I could never donate to one of those TV 'save the children' charities, lining these people's pockets when they're throwing change comparatively at the causes people THINK they're helping... it just makes my stomach turn.   Now, I realize not everyone will agree with this because as others have said elsewhere, there's many types of desi experiences and whats not okay for me is perfectly fine for someone else. That said, [this](http://thecolorrun.com/faqs/) is their FAQ and this just ... gets me a bit:  &gt;What is the inspiration behind The Color Run™?  &gt;The Color Run 5k is the first paint race of its kind and was inspired by several awesome events, including Disney’s World of Color, Paint Parties, Mud Runs, and Festivals throughout the world such as Holi.  It does bother me to see Holi in a list with Disney's World of Color. It does bother me that they acknowledge that yes, this is basically Holi only we took out that silly ""culture"" business and made it fun and meaningless for the whole family to enjoy!   Holi has always been my most favourite of holidays, the celebration of spring and renewal, the celebration of love... It just makes it much harder for me to share my culture with those that I cherish who may not be desi or have a understanding of Holi.   Chances are pretty good, the more these runs go on, the greater the chance that someone will say to me ""Oh Holi! This is just like the Color Run I did back in 2013, it was SO much fun."" Do I sit them down at that point and tell them that they might look the same but this fond memory they have is a bastardization of something that means a lot to me? Something they PAID to do... and have no idea how much of that actually went to someone in need. The whole thing is sad. And wrong.

t5_2se5q,imyourconscience,1382049587,"I'm an anxiety/stress biter! And while I've managed to grow my nails I STILL put the damn things in my mouth! It's hard to beat - but a method that worked for me is when I felt myself wanting to bite my nails, instead I'd rub in cuticle oil or put lotion on my hands! By the time I'm done with the oil or lotion (a greasy one works best because I rub my hands longer) the urge to bite has passed.  Ad her nails grow out, instead of biting she can file them also. Granted, that's something she might only want to do once a week but it helps - at least for me!  I started doing my nails A LOT as a way to be discouraged to bite...but instead what happened is uncontrollable urges to peel it and bite it off! Which itself was causing me anxiety! :( so for the past few days I've gone polish free (except for a nourishing basecoat and things are going ok.  SO THAT BEING SAID- ultimately my advice to her is to work on turning her bad habit into a good habit. She should work on recognizing when she has the urge to bite before he fingers go into her mouth (if she hasn't already) and instead apply oil or lotion. Keep bottle of lotion or oil at work, at home, in her purse at all times! Because being stuck without it when you need it only worsens the anxiety (oh god, I can feel it building up just thinking about it!).  Hope that helps. :) And good luck to her! ♥",♥

t5_2va9w,Reeiiko,1382056915,"Luckily I have it saved for copypasta:  Today Twilight and I did the most spontaneous thing either of us have ever done in our entire lives. We got married!  We never would have imagined waking up this morning that we’d be husband and wife by the end of the day, we were planning the whole ceremony for next summer. But life works in unexpected ways, and sometimes an opportunity comes along and you just have to go for it. We were sitting around on Skype chatting with the minister who we were planning to have perform our wedding ceremony next summer, bemoaning the financial issues we were struggling with surrounding the guests and catering, renting a tuxedo (Twi’s wedding gown was already taken care of), the rings, and everything else that goes into planning a wedding. We weren’t sure how we could ever possibly pull it off on my college student budget, and then Twi once again (as she had done several times before) reminded me that she didn’t care about having a fancy dress or a big event with lots of fanfare. The only thing that was really important to her was that we’d always be together, and making that commitment to each other was all that really mattered.  At that point the minister brought up that if we wanted he could actually perform the ceremony over webcam rather than having to travel from his home country of Sweden to America to do it, the doctrines of the Universal Life Church do allow him to do that. Then before I even had a chance to think about the matter Twi blurted out “Then lets do it!”. I just grinned at her and said “You really want to?”, to which Twilight replied “Of course! It’s much more financially efficient than having an extravagant wedding ceremony and I’ve already told you I don’t care about all the trappings. My family in Equestria isn’t going to be able to attend anyway. All that really matters is that we love each other and know we want to spend the rest of our lives together”. I didn’t even have to think it over, she was right.  And like that, the ceremony began. The minister gave his speech, I held Twilight’s hooves in my hands, and when the time came we each said our “I do”s and kissed. It all went by so fast I could hardly catch my breath, and before either of us knew it we were husband and wife. Not in a way that would be recognized by the state, nor in a way that would be recognized by most of society, but under the authority of the Universal Life Church and, most importantly of all, in our hearts we were now married. The official wedding rings and the honeymoon will come later, but for the ceremony our engagement rings served just fine and we’ve still got most of a semester of college to go before we can take a honeymoon. Besides, our official wedding rings are going to be custom machined from a meteorite and those will take quite some time to craft. We should have them by the time our honeymoon comes around though. But for today those weren’t needed. Today all that was required was that we make a joyous commitment to each other in witness of our minister, and for him to recognize and validate that commitment. Our marriage certificate will be arriving in the mail in the not too distant future.  This wedding turned out absolutely nothing like either of us ever imagined it would be, completely non-traditional in every way. And yet, we both feel exactly the same way we always knew we would feel afterwards. Absolutely elated! I don't think either of us could possibly feel any happier than we do today. Best day of both of our lives, hands and hooves down!  I write to you now not just as someone on the internet named Matthew (or Jin as many have come to know me), but as Twilight Sparkle’s husband. For as long as we may live and in any life that may come after this one, I am hers and she is mine. Always and forever. Best wishes to you and yours. ♥ ",♥

t5_2rbms,Sileni,1382066792,"You have a mighty fine system there.  With:    &gt;GIGABYTE motherboards feature GIGABYTE DualBIOS™, an exclusive technology from GIGABYTE that protects arguably one of your PC's most crucial components, the BIOS. GIGABYTE DualBIOS™ means that your motherboard has both a 'Main BIOS' and a 'Backup BIOS', making users protected from BIOS failure due to virus attack, hardware malfunction, improper OC settings or power failure during the update process.      So here is the explanation of why your boot information is doing what you don't want it to do.  I really don't know how to get around this (many have pulled out their hair over it).  There is a way, but it means feeding the program files.  The program I am referring to is on a chip on your motherboard.  It maintains the partition where your boot records reside.  It is not meant to be written to.  It is a product of the hardware vendor and Microsoft to keep boot viruses out of your computer (cough, cough).  If you are not running windows, you don't need it.  Only people wiho are going to run disks larger than 2tb and multiple partitions and mega memory really need the new GPT partition table and the UEFI that goes with it.  Personally, I would revert the machine to 'legacy boot' (use a master boot record) and use grub2 and lvm.     I did not look up how to get into the real bios for that machine (usually the escape key or F10 or tab when the machine is booting-the splash screen show have the key with 'setup' beside it)  but that is where you would make the change.    If you have it working now, you can just ignore the erroneous boot information.  It really won't bother you too much.    You did say you wanted to redo it.  So what you would do is google how to get into bios, change the disk setup to legacy (not GPT) and install the linux (non-uefi enabled) and be sure to install grub2  to the master boot record at the end of the install.  That way you will not be bothered by the machine messing with your boot loader all the time.      I know this is massive, so sorry, but one last thing.  Instead of trying to explain it better, I copied this page from the web just for your information (for when you partition your disks):     &gt;Technical Note: Why You Should Use Both an HD and an SSD  An SSD works best for files that are often read (ie, opening up a document or video, or starting a program) but not written (ie, saving or downloading a file) for two reasons:      Reads are generally faster than writes (ie, saving a file) for SSDs.     Writes will wear out your SSD much faster than reads compared to a regular hard drive (over a long period of time, anyway).  So basically you don’t want to download stuff onto your SSD, or use it for system temporary files or browser caches. Your old magnetic platter HD is ideal for low demand downloads and such like where disk latency is unlikely to be greater than your actual down bandwidth. And assuming you have a modern system with 6GB+ of RAM you can use RAM for temp and cache files to keep your system blazing fast without wear and tear on your SSD.    ----From:  http://www.mysolutions.it/linux-ssd-solid-state-drive/      TLDR:  Your fancy MB will not let you fix the boot menu, you can live with it, or reinstall after changing the machine from GPT to legacy boot.

Il computer B é un altro computer della VPN (che, come ho detto, é una sorta di ""lan via internet"", nel senso che puoi avere 2, 50, millemila® computer connessi come se fossero tutti nella stessa stanza ma in realtá sono sparsi per il globo).  Potrebbe essere piú sicuro perché nel paese in cui risiede quel computer la giurisdizione é meno restrittiva, oppure semplicemente puoi farti i fatti tuoi senza che nessuno nel tuo paese ti faccia storie. Oppure banalmente ti serve un computer che faccia le tue veci in un paese straniero (ad esempio: il tal sito pretende che tu abbia un IP statunitense, il computer B é fisicamente negli stati uniti, il sito accetta la richiesta dal computer B senza porsi problemi)  &gt;in altre parole come hai scelto il computer B? è un pc aziendale? l'idea è che il tuo traffico figura come aziendale e quindi è più difficilmente riconducibile a una persona fisica (tu)?  Il computer B te lo devi affittare/comprare nel luogo che ritieni piú opportuno (esempio: affitti un server per qualche dollaro al mese negli stati uniti).  Il traffico non risulta come ""aziendale"", risulta come un flusso di dati cifrato. Alcune aziende forniscono un servizio VPN per uso, appunto, aziendale. Puoi essere a casa, in aeroporto o sulla spiaggia ma grazie alla VPN hai a disposizione tutto quello che serve per lavorare come se fossi materialmente in ufficio (che culo!).

t5_mouw,coffeeismyonlyfriend,1382108450,"actually, that's not true. if you read the book Eating in the Dark, the author talks about Starlink™corn, and how genetic drift from GM corn in the US has ruined strains of corn that were developed over hundreds of years by Mexico. these strains were used during drought years or damp years, or what have you, to ensure a crop no matter the weather that year. but genetic drift changed the characteristics of the corn, causing crops to fail and people to go hungry.     I'd like it to be noted that we are driven by money in America due to our capitalist system-and for that reason alone we should be wary! More money might be the company X's goal instead of curing a disease-as the people in the lab would like to believe as they are working.      People who speak out against GMO have every right to be cautious, let them speak and listen to their concerns. If they can be addressed, address them.

t5_2t5xf,OutOfNiceUsernames,1382110846,"Regardless of what EY’s intentions on this were or are, I agree on this point:  &gt;(If it IS a wordless intuitive leap that can't be adequately explained, what is it doing here, in this particular story, a story that's supposed to introduce concepts about how to think to a broad audience?)  The same thought had occurred to me several times during *my* reading. The story presents itself as a guide and tool to fostering interest towards rationality solving problems with it. However, as the book moves on, the “rationality” part gets smaller and smaller and is being replaced by a usual adventure plot that is only covered with the Rationality merchandise. Harry uses Ratioality™ and quickly discovers how to partially transfigurate, he uses Ratioality™ and quickly discovers how to slay dementors or upgrade the Patronus charm etc.  I get that it’s a story and as that should not be taken so seriously, but I feel like ii it would’ve been much more interesting if the MoR elements where primary in the story and the story plot elements about “who wins the fight?” and “who’s awesome?” where given much less importance.  I agree with [Yxoque’s first bullet-point](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1onz1c/dont_believe_everything_you_think_where_do_harrys/ccu8qsa) though: human intuition *can* work in uncontrollable ways—I’d just like it to be portrayed a bit more realistically still and for it to have more inner-story examinations (be more frequently discussed by characters, perhaps?).",™

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1382113188,"&gt;###SWTOR Holiday Update  &gt;##10.18.2013  &gt;Hello everyone,  &gt;With the Summer of SWTOR officially behind us, and some big announcements about our upcoming free Digital Expansion now released, I wanted to just share in one place a summary of the things we are working on for you in the months ahead. Some of this is a recap of information we have already released, but there are some new pieces here too!  &gt;First up is Game Update 2.4.2, which is currently targeted for launch on October 29th. This biweekly update contains the usual bug fixes and minor tweaks, but it is notable for two very important features: the start of Ranked PvP Season One, and the launch of web-based Ranked PvP Leaderboards!  &gt;Have you ever been frustrated trying to find an available name when making a new character? We currently have many, many millions of character names across all the servers, some of which are no longer in use, and as has been frequently noted here on the forums it is difficult to find any good names. We want to flag some 36% of those characters for rename, many of which were created in the early days after launch, and free up a lot of name options for our current players. Get ready to snag that name you always wanted! Exact details are forthcoming, but here’s what you need to know now: Current Subscribers will not have any characters renamed, regardless of activity or level on that character. Period. Even on inactive accounts, the bulk of characters renamed will be under level 10, and no character level 30 or higher will be renamed. November 12th is our current target date for this.  &gt;Speaking of November 12th, that will be the start of the next Bounty Contract Week, which we’ll continue to have every month. In other event news the mysterious Gree Starship will be returning in December. As you’ve seen, we continue to update and improve these events and add new Galactic Reputation rewards.  &gt;As Thanksgiving Season approaches, you are at the top of our list of things we are thankful for. We receive a lot of support from you, the players, and it’s really because of you that we are able to continue development on this game we love so much. We’d like to show a tiny measure of that thanks with a Double XP weekend starting November 27th and continuing through Thanksgiving Weekend until December 2nd.  &gt;The no-longer-super-secret space project has been revealed at last! We are working hard to bring you the Galactic Starfighter™ free Digital Expansion in February, but on December 3rd we are planning to open it up to Subscribers with Game Update 2.5: Galactic Starfighter Subscriber Early Access. Also in Game Update 2.5 we’ll have continued class balance updates and an all new PvP Warzone Arena, the Makeb Mesa Arena.  &gt;We will have individual blogs and updates on each and every one of the above items, stay tuned to SWTOR.com and these forums for updates! This isn’t an exhaustive list, and we are also working on some (very exciting) longer term stuff and some shorter term surprises we aren’t ready to cough up just yet. As always the dates listed above are the dates the teams are shooting for, and though we are working very hard and feel like we can hit them there is always a chance something will have to slip if it’s not ready. I’ll let you know as soon as we know if that happens.  &gt;We here at BioWare would like to say thank you for your continued support. I was going to say ‘keep your feedback coming’, but I don’t think you need the encouragement - you’re a vocal lot! But we love to hear it, and we wouldn’t rather have any other community than you. See you in game!  &gt;Bruce Maclean   Senior Producer",™

t5_2rww2,Only_A_Username,1382113646,"What I'm using:  [Ecotools flat foundation brush](http://www.ecotools.com/flat-foundation-brush)  [Ecotools Airbrush Concealer Brush](http://www.ecotools.com/airbrush-concealer-brush)  [Concealer Twins 2-in-1 Correct and Cover Cream Green/Light](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod560248)  [L'Oreal True Match™ Super-Blendable Compact Makeup n3](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/products/makeup/face/foundation/true-match-super-blendable-compact-makeup.aspx)  First, I put on my morning moisturizer/sunscreen. Then I use the airbrush brush to put the green Physicians formula on the more prominent red spots on my face, a lot of the complaints in the reviews is that it goes on way too thick and I've found that using a very, very small amount with this brush negates that and blends really well. After that I use the foundation brush and the foundation to even everything out. One of the things that I was really worried about is that it would be obvious that I'm wearing makeup, but even I can barely tell it's there.   Special thanks to TheKittenButcher's tutorial on how to cover blemishes. I've never really considered wearing makeup before this point, and I gotta say it's really given me the confidence to go out without constantly being self-conscious about how I look.   Thanks again, everyone :)    Edit: I've also found that the moisturizer keeps the foundation from drying out and getting powdery/cracked throughout the day, and it seriously helps with making everything look natural and non makeup-y.   Edit 2: I really wasn't expecting this to blow up as much as it did, thanks everyone! There are a lot of comments about how well I put it on, if you guys'd like I might be able to make a video or something. I was also asked for a ""before"" picture so I'll put that up once I get home from work.",™

t5_2r0gj,brownbearclan,1382128649,"Thanks for your kind words. I will be speaking at the funeral and have decided to just talk about how close we had become these past couple months. I'm going to share a story that happened the morning after he passed that has given us a lot of comfort. In fact I'll share it right here with you now:  I'd like to share something with everyone that has helped to bring me and my family peace and could be called a sign or miracle. Although I'd say I'm an atheist if I had to call myself something I now have to add the word agnostic to that term because of something that happened the morning after my brother passed that rocked my beliefs to the core. My mom, sister who found him and I were sitting in the living talking about how peaceful the house felt, not creepy at all, like a huge burden had been lifted and that we felt like my brother was completely at peace. Right then, there was a knock on the back door, 3 light raps of knuckles. My sister was standing maybe 6 feet from the door and my mom instantly said, grab the door and my sister opened it within 3 seconds and nobody was there. Nobody was outside and nobody was anywhere near the house besides us three. My brother always knocked just like that, 3 light raps with his knuckles on my sisters door every time he needed to talk to her or wake her up. It was like he was trying to tell us that yes, he was at peace and to not worry, that what we were saying was exactly right. I even went outside and tried to find something, anything that could explain it, there was nothing. So needless to say, I'm seeing things very differently all of the sudden. I'm open to the possibility that there may be something out there we have yet to understand. I'm not about to start going to church or anything but I have a whole new perspective because of this. This small thing has brought us more comfort than anything anyone has said or could possibly do and maybe, just maybe I will see my bro again someday.  Again thank you for your advice, all the responses here have been exactly what I needed, I feel the love. ♥",♥

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1382130796," &gt;###Galactic Starfighter Development, Introduction: Part I &gt;##10.18.2013  &gt;##Introduction  &gt;Greetings Starfighters,  &gt;Let me welcome you to what will be the first of many Developer Diaries delving into the background and development of Galactic Starfighter™ and its place within the Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ experience.  &gt;Before I get into the details of this diary entry, let me say thank you to all of you, our incredible fans. Your enthusiasm over the last couple years and leading up to the announcement of Galactic Starfighter has inspired the development team and been critical in crafting the vision of what the digital expansion has become, as well as what it will evolve into in the future. You may have assumed we weren’t listening, but I promise, we were reading every post… and taking copious notes.  &gt;So, with that, let’s talk about Galactic Starfighter, or as many of you have been calling it, the Super-Secret Space Project (SSSP).  &gt;##The Birth of a Concept  &gt;When the leaders of our studio first sat down to talk about what needed to be part of our first BIG push into the stars about two years ago, the list became very long—there were just so many Star Wars™ fantasies to fulfill in such a rich universe: bounty hunters and smugglers, Kessel Runs and capital ships, discovery of never-before-seen-planets, as well as long-lost species, and of course, Starfighter combat. And that’s the short list of the things we came up with.  &gt;Before we could even really define what this expansion was going to look like, we had to put it on hold. This pause went on for almost a year as we planned and worked on content for the ground game, added a Free-to-Play option for our players, and created content for a number of other features that players expected and wanted. It wasn’t until August of 2012 that work started again on defining how we wanted to revisit space.  &gt;After a great deal of deliberation, it was clear we had to prioritize which features would be best received by you, the fans, as well as give the greatest amount of replayability. And at the same time, we knew we had to create a strong foundation to build on for the future, you know, in case we wanted to add onto it later on… possibly.  &gt;At that time, we knew two things were vital to the experience: free-flight space combat and ship customization.  &gt;##The Evolution of a Concept The very next question was how. How do you deliver on those two requirements and still appease such devout fans who, understandably, want the very best Star Wars experience possible?  &gt;It wasn’t easy, and every path had obstacles. Do you create a massive, open world to fly transports around, smuggling goods through enemy lines? Do you create capital ships, some so vast players feel they’re on another planet? Do you populate all of that with more quests and voice actors and opportunities for crafting and Star Destroyers and the Force™ and more? It was literally a whole new game, possibly larger than what we had already created.  &gt;Wisely, we took a step back and looked at the broader picture. We looked at the landscape of possibilities and where there were opportunities, when we quickly realized the answer was simple: PvP. Players had been clamoring for it since launch—the experience of customizing their own Starfighter and pitting your skills against other pilots in epic Star Wars environments; the sound of that familiarmusic kicking in as you destroy an enemy’s objective; your Companions interrupting your focus to let you know an enemy is on your tail or your shields are down.  &gt;Momentum quickly grew as we imagined the possibilities. What started as a feature for Star Wars: The Old Republic all of a sudden was becoming a game all by itself. So we embraced it. We focused on it. And we never looked back.  &gt;From there, it was just a matter of creating a strong vision for the player’s experience – the combat, the environments, the feel of it all – both as a pilot, but also in customizing your ships and how it’s all integrated together with the ground game.  &gt;And while that’s all very interesting, you probably want to know more of the details about what to expect once Galactic Starfighter goes live. Let me tell you… in our next developer diary!  &gt;Michael Backus   Senior Designer",™

t5_2rxrw,DavisDogLady,1382130952,"Well I remember the ads for it in my college newspaper, but I was never in a position to take the time to do it. Here is the blurb I found from a local IVF website  &gt; Women who decide to donate their eggs achieve the incredible satisfaction of being able to help another woman have a child. In order to become a donor in our egg donation program, a woman must be a non-smoker between the ages of 21 and 31, in good general health, and free of any sexually transmitted diseases. She must also live within two hours of our Roseville clinic, be employed, and cannot use Depo-Provera® for birth control. Women who are adopted, who have any family members with inheritable genetic conditions, or who have had an immediate family member commit suicide cannot become egg donors. A potential egg donor also must not have lived or stayed in the United Kingdom for three months or longer, or elsewhere in Europe for five years or longer since 1980.  I think I will look into it. I am a blood donor and on the bone marrow registry/organ donor.  I would like to donate one my kidneys but after a discussion with my family I decided to keep it in case one of them needed it eventually. I believe organ/tissue donation is one of those amazing modern medical practices that is changing the world and I love it.  I won't be having kids for another 4-5 years so it's not like my system wouldn't have time to relax for a bit if I donated. I will bring it up tonight to the SO",®

t5_2rpe6,idmontie,1382133417,"I don't understand this subreddit or it's community.  Why are there downvotes on this post?  Just because you disagree with something doesn't mean you should just downvote it; you should comment and express your opinion.  Now, onto the topic at hand:  Having a standard format would really help Yu-Gi-Oh's problem with [Power Creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_creep).  As this game gets older,  Konami continuously has to ""one up"" the previous set so that it will sell.  Rather than focus on balancing the game, Konami constantly has to release powerful cards that everyone tries to grab, and then hits them on the next ban list.  I think everyone really noticed this when the Dragon Rulers and Spellbook of Judgment came out.  On the other hand, the YuGiOh community really seems split between people who spend tons of money  and those who don't spend very much.  For those who spend tons of money, Standard wouldn't affect them that much, since they already usually buy the latest set of cards.  For those who don't spend very much, Standard would be *the worst thing ever*™.  No one wants all of their cards to be obsolete the next format, but these are also the same people that complain about the game being unbalanced, so there really is no way to please them other than slowing down the power creep.  Just my thoughts on the subject.",™
t5_2s5rz,Tyaeth,1382133612,"I think that it's also relevant to mention a bunch of other things that the patch brings (source [shoryuken.com](http://shoryuken.com/2013/10/15/dead-or-alive-5-ultimates-version-1-03-update-brings-balance-changes-new-halloween-themed-stage-and-costume-dlc/)):   **New Changes/Features**  * New stage “Haunted Lorelei” added. * New music “Imps’ Ball” and “Ghouls’ Ball” added. * “Fights” and “Wins” information no longer displayed when an opponent is found for Ranked Matches. * “Searching for opponents” message added when searching for a Throwdown opponent. * Settings except for lobby names now remembered when creating and searching for lobbies. * Lobby chat character limit increased from 20 to 100. * Added numbers to differentiate between stages of the same name in Movies. * Updated the way replay data is saved to be compatible with the changes in Ver. 1.03.

Please carry over save data from DOA5 after applying this patch in order for fight records to be counted. * The following title unlock requirements were effected: * 　”Fight X times online” * 　”Win X times online” * 　”Use [character] X times” * 　”Win X times online with [character]” * Fixed the description for the “Streak Breaker” title. * Corrected the following trophy/achievement descriptions from “Clear all courses” to “Clear 1 course” to match the actual unlock conditions in-game: * 　Arcade (Tag) Cleared * 　Time Attack (Tag) Cleared * 　Survival (Tag) Cleared * Fixed an issue with Leifang’s display after performing multiple Power Launchers in Free Training and other modes. * Fixed an issue with the “Fuel” stage so that characters are no longer able to go outside the stage. * Fixed the camera behavior during certain throws when performed near a wall. * Fixed an issue that allowed players to cancel the recovery time for certain strikes. * Fixed the timing of the Power Blow charge-up animation, which was previously off by 1 frame. * Fixed an issue with the damage after certain staggers in tag matches. * Fixed an issue in Story mode in the second fight of Chapter 70 that prevented progress after a successful Force Out. * Fixed Leon’s air throws to register correctly as wall hits against certain objects. * Fixed to allow tech rolls after being staggered in midair. * Fixed an issue preventing followup combo throws after Rachel’s 214P+K hits a launched opponent. * Fixed an issue after a throw escape from Zack’s Ducking T, Hitomi’s 236T, etc. that caused some characters to hold even without any player input. * Fixed the bounce animation when landing from certain staggers in midair. * Fixed the timing that tag changes are disabled after a Force Out. * Adjusted the system criteria so that all hits that look like wall hits are counted as such. * Changed part of the combo in Pai’s “Tag Combo (from Pai)” Combo Challenge that used an unintended feature changed in this patch. * Fixed Pai’s 66P+K to prevent it from being read as 466P+K after a back dash, etc.  **Balance Changes**  Rachel  * 66K: Recovery increased by 4 frames. * 1PP, 214P: Advantage on block increased from -12 to -15 frames. * Light ground attack: Initial frames increased from 17 to 22, whiff recovery increased to 12 frames.

t5_2qixx,Osteosarcofuuuuck,1382147438,"I've been dealing with a huge osteosarcoma (bone cancer) that's now in my brain for the past year and a half or so, and with having my right leg amputated along with some pelvis for about a year and I know exactly what you mean. I think it is in part our bitterness that brings the problem to light in our minds. I feel slightly the same way about cancer as I do seeing ""wounded warriors"" get all sorts of help and respect because they lost a limb. It's like what the fuck I didn't even sign up to put myself in harms way (for reasons other than pure love of the country most times  IMO but that's a whole different discussion). The part that gets me about breast cancer awareness is it's all Susan g komen and the way that whole operation is run is bullshit. Different places have different numbers but the CEO makes roughly 700k/yr off of the foundation. It's bullshit. That's the part that gets me even more than pink football cleats and basketball shoes...it's god damn frustrating. But dude (I assume, correct me if I'm wrong) it's okay...good for them. Yes it gets more money for research for other cancers but shit it wouldn't help me anyways, even if it were in some way taking away from bone cancer research. Basically my way of looking at it so it doesn't piss me off is that it's not really affecting me in any way ya know? I'm not gonna live or die because there's a whole month dedicated to one specific kind of cancer....I'm not gonna get my leg back because some nice people built a house for a man who had his legs blown off . And personally no one is going to say to me, o at least ya don't have breast cancer. And who knows man maybe if the extra cash helps find a cure or whatever faster for breast cancer, that will pave the way for other forms of cancer too.

You aren't alone even if you have as a rare a cancer as I do (my age/location/and it spreading to essentially my brain happens almost never. As in once every few years in the u.s.) . A lot of people know how you feel, even if you never see or hear them. Good luck with this bullshit known as cancer. I almost feel like family with other cancer patients sometimes without even knowing their name, it's crazy. So although I'm sure you have tons of people pulling for ya, now ya have one more.

t5_2v94d,dace,1382155663,"Some interesting LN bits:  - **Upgrade capacity down to 2, vs 4 in the LX** - maybe this is what gives the extra 2 Class-1 hardpoints?  - Main engines up to 2xTR2 (vs 1xTR2 in the LX in the brochure, and vs. 1xTR3 on the ship specs page) EDIT: actually there's a problem here: different pages say different things for main engines.  Will have to wait for clarification/fixes  - Power plant is **L2** size (vs L1 in the LX)  - Confirmed stock Aurora LN still only has **5t** cargo capacity despite the commercial  - Confirmed no jump engine in stock config  - ""Optional electroskin berth allows for **milspec camo** installation"" - interesting!  - ""UEE-spec weapon attach mounts"" - I wonder if that ties into the SQ42 hints they gave us today in Wingman's Hangar 42, where you can potentially buy better milspec weapons if you have high enough faction with the UEE   ----  Interesting stuff from the LX:  - It's the only non-base Aurora with 4 upgrade slots open.  Sounds like it'll be the most flexible, and likely best for exploring  - ""GRIP flooring allows for maximum traction in zero, partial or full gravity""  - ""Magnetic deck placement to enhance vacuum survivability""  - I think I want whatever a ""HYPERPILLOW™"" is  Sounds like gravity turning off in your ship is maybe more likely than they'd previously implied.  The LX sounds like a lot of aesthetic/lore changes instead of functional ones.  I guess that sort of makes sense for the ""luxury"" version.  The LN looks like it might be more objectively useful in many cases due to better arms/armor, though the LX looks better for exploring.  -----  Other thoughts:  - The stats are **inconsistent**:  pages 9-12 say the MR, CL, LN and LX have TR2 engines, but page 13 says they have TR3 engines.   - The reiteration of this part really makes me wonder if there's going to be a lot of work to switch things like cargo between different types of ships: &gt; ""the Astro Team has crafted the Aurora and Constellation lines to be fully interchangeable. Owners of both ships can share upgrades, cargo pallets, repair systems and consumables without needing to worry about a second supply chain""      ",™

I'm now on a temperate embark, water is frozen. I want to make a well for the sake of having a well. I was planing to do a cistern while the thing is still frozen and I'm having some doubts about it.   It should consist of something like this:  * One big hole right under the river to be filled with water, about 3-5 levels deep, maybe 5x5 * A smaller hole right under the well, 3x3. As deep as the other one, to avoid muddy water * A tunnel per level with a diagonal cut to avoid building up pressure and flooding the fort before it even starts. It would connect both holes, they would also be on a different place on each level, I still don't know how water behaves  Questions now  * Would this work? * Will the stored water freeze? * If above is a yes, Is there any way to thaw it?

I was certain that the captain must have planned something, and whatever this army was looked rather ancient, so there's no way it would affect me present day, right?  The lieutenant gave a hand signal and the troops began marching, thousands and thousands of simultaneous footfalls, marching in line to an unknown destination.   An explosion. Chaos. Within minutes, my lieutenant returns to me.   “Captain, we've slain the enemies and captured their encampment as well as all of their resources. Would you like me to escort you to the spoils?”   “Yes, lieutenant, that would be excellent.”   I was lead up a clearly paved road, far more contemporary than my soldiers were. What was going on here?   We approached a very modern looking building, it was unmarked but it appeared to be some sort of warehouse.   “Here we are captain.”   I could hardly breathe as I crossed through the rough hewn threshold my soldiers had blown through the wall.

t5_2t5sa,deathpigeonx,1382164861,"I'm a man, but I was never particularly manly, especially in temperament and my views on strength and stuff like that. I didn't really care about getting strong while growing up and prided myself in my intellect, not my strength.  Despite all this, I was always expected to be strong. When there were heavy boxes to be lifted, people would expect me to be among those lifting them, but generally not the women around me. They had preconceived notions about women as weaker and particularly men as stronger, so it was always me and other men who were around, not women who were around, doing things that required strength. This, in and of itself, is an expression of the patriarchal gender roles for both men and women and a good example of how the patriarchy hurts men.  As a result of those societal expectations of me expressed in how people treated me and what people would ask me to do, I grew strong, *despite not caring to and actively not really wanting to*. I was, for a long time, embarrassed by my strength and would often deliberately downplay how strong I am because I didn't want to be strong. I am and was strong, nonetheless.  Society has different expectations from women. When there is jobs that require strength to be done, people don't turn to them and will, often, look down on them for helping or actively discourage them from helping. If they are carrying something heavy, oftentimes men who have internalized gender roles will offer to help them. Then, when it comes to things that require little strength, society looks to them, and treats men the same way it treats women when it comes to jobs that require strength, generally. Because of that, if a woman doesn't have a particular want to become strong, she won't, especially not if she actively doesn't want to be strong.  I actively didn't want to become strong, but, simply because I was a man, society put me into scenario after scenario to make me strong, dragging me kicking and screaming into strength.  Now, a woman who wanted to be strong and actively worked to be strong would be stronger than me, but she would generally still be treated like society treats other women when it comes to more mundane strength tasks, so she'll have less chances to practice her strength than a man who puts an equivalent effort into becoming strong, so she won't be as strong as him, despite training just as hard, because society treats men and women differently.  This might all be wrong, but this is my personal experience with things and why I think this gap in strength exists. It isn't any biotruth™ or anything to do with genetics. It is how society treats men and women differently that forces strength upon men and puts barriers to strength for women.",™

t5_2qh1i,GirlPlays10S,1382190614,"Don't work for an airline, but work in the industry. Few things to know about TSA PreCheck:   1) access to use PreCheck is randomized per-flight, never guaranteed access even after you get it from you airline or via background check in the GlobalEntry application. Anecdotally, if you get enrolled from your airline the success rate is 1/3 of flights. If you get it through GlobalEntry, success rate seems to be about 2/3. (TSA has never commented on success rates, but this is just observed from passenger remarks).  2) If you get enrolled into PreCheck from your airline, you can only get access when flying on that airline. For example, if you got access through United, only can use PreCheck when flying on United, but if you need to fly Delta one day, you won't get access to PreCheck for that flight (even though Delta participates in PreCheck). If you get access via GlobalEntry, you can use PreCheck on any airline that participates, but eligibility is still randomized per-flight. Participating airlines: United, Delta, US Airways, Alaska, Virgin America, Hawaiian, and as of this week, Southwest. JetBlue is trying to set up a PreCheck program, but they first need to set up a formal frequent flyer program like the other airlines in order to make it work.   3) That being said, the ability to use PreCheck is based on your boarding pass/Trusted Traveler Number. When you scan your boarding pass at the TSA ID checkpoint, if you hear 3 beeps, then you can keep your shoes on, etc. A Trusted Traveler Number must be used when you book your flight in order for your boarding pass to give you eligibility for TSA PreCheck on that flight. You get a Trusted Traveler Number from your airline and/or GlobalEntry when you get enrolled in PreCheck.   4) Just because you see a PreCheck symbol on your boarding pass, doesn't mean you can use PreCheck that day. Not all airports have PreCheck lines in every terminal or checkpoint, although this is quickly expanding.   5) Since so many people have applied to GlobalEntry just for PreCheck access (in May 2013 there was a backlog of 33,0000 applications), there are now a few other ways to get access to PreCheck.  --TSA has been said to begin using SecureFlight (which pre-screens all travelers for flight risk) to given non-PreCheck members (all travelers) access to PreCheck based on a color coding system on your boarding pass (""green"" for trusted travelers, ""yellow"" for non-members of Pre-Check and ""red"" for probable security risks.).  -- TSA has begun testing a program where they use dogs to walk up and down the regular security lines to sniff for substances and devices. Those who qualify will also be eligible to use the PreCheck line after they pass the ID check.  -- TSA in fall 2013 is expected to roll-out it's own application for TSA PreCheck (whereas before it was only via airlines or GlobalEntry, which is a US Customs program not TSA). You will be able to apply for $85 and it will be good for 5 years. After online application, you will need to go to Dulles Airport in DC or Indianapolis Airport to get fingerprinted and then you will get your ""Trusted Traveler Number"" for PreCheck.   Another fun fact for the redditors: TSA PreCheck is actually spelled like this: TSA Pre✓™ and in April 2013, it was hard to get to information on the TSA website about PreCheck because they had the check mark and the trademark symbol in the URL for their page on the TSA website, like this: ""www.tsa.gov/TSA-Pre✓™ "". They fixed it now.",™

t5_2qh63,BashCo,1382191245,"Not at all. Millions of Americans simply can't afford medical care. You know as well as I do what their insurance policy is, even if they *already have 'insurance'*:  **Don't Get Sick! ™**  Care to cite your claim that 70% are happy with their insurance providers?  Nobody in my family has had a positive experience with health insurance providers. One member had to sue just to get them to pay what they claimed was covered. She won, but many people don't have the financial means to go home with a $0.00 paycheck for several weeks because it all went to the insurance company. Another was intimidated away from filing claims for a severe workplace injury that put him out of work. He never recovered. Later on he required stitches on his face for a separate injury, and just superglued his face because he couldn't afford an ER visit.   I've got friends with similarly horrific stories. I've been lucky, but I wouldn't dare go to the ER unless my organs were falling out.

t5_2qh1i,bg-j38,1382197024,I've always hated that it's officially called TSA Pre✓™ because I do actually like referring to things correctly but that's a bitch to type.  I flew out of SFO yesterday and was waiting for my wife at the priority checkpoint for United. So I happened to notice that most of the time there were 10-15 people in line for the PreCheck line and sometimes no one for normal security. That jives with what you're saying about so many people signing up. I signed up about 6 months ago and haven't heard anything. I'm United Silver though hopefully I'll hit Gold before the end of the year. My wife has Gold this year and has had a single flight where she got access to it. Hasn't seen it since. I'll have to ask her about the Trusted Traveler Number. She's never mentioned that. I would assume if she books through United it would automatically be added to her reservation.,™

t5_2s4mc,Fauropitotto,1382221672,"I always have a seperate flashlight with me when I leave the house. Say I drop my keys at night walking back to the car, or I have to change a flat tire. So I figure what would be the point in carrying *both* a weapon-mounted light as well as my stand alone light.    Then I was thinking about the speed that life or death situations occur, and the means by which many lights are activated. Some have toggle switches that require your trigger finger to activate, others have some sort of expensive gripswitch accessory you can purchase.   In the end, I decided that I am a civilian. In my state, I'm required to carry concealed, which means carrying the lowest profile weapon system possible for my body type and wardrobe. Couple that with the fact that, as civilians, we're not sweeping rooms or actually *hunting down* BadGuys™ in dark alleys, our typical life-or-death situation is likely going to be fast, unexpected, and a reflex quick draw situation. It'll likely be too fast to really look for that tiny red/green dot from a laser...it may even be too close to have enough room to get a good sight picture (meaning no expensive night sights).    Even in your own house, I've been reading about the FBI Technique for holding a weapon and a light. This is where you hold the light high above your head and to your side, while you hold the pistol in your other hand. The idea is that pistol mounted lights give the BadGuy a very bright target to shoot at. Even if he's ""blinded"" all he has to do is point in the direction of the bright light (aka your center mass), and pop off a few rounds. By separating the light from your center of mass (high and away from your center), you reduce the ability of the BadGuy to get accurate shots off at you under low light situations.   With that in mind, I don't have lights or lasers on my pistol. I believe if in the event I have to draw, it will likely be a point and shoot situation. Any bad guy far enough away from you to require accurate shooting with nightsights, lasers, and/or lights is probably not truly a lethal threat to you in a legal sense.  edit: I make concealment gun holsters for a living, so I'm well aware of what it takes to conceal a weapon + attachments.

Over 2 trillion could be written off the books by the Fed without even a ripple.  The world has not been flat for a while now.  When it was, wealth was made mostly by plunder.  The New World was conquered and it begat Mercantilism.  Bretton Woods ended that and Commercialism arose where wealth was managed by central banks.  A worldwide depression bracketed by two world wars laid waste to that.  After WWII the hegemony of the $US, meant that other countries could drastically reduce their war spending and receive access to massive lines of credit backed by US worker productivity, the ninth wonder of the world.  New Monetary Theory posits that this productivity should continue to produce great wealth until another currency is ascendant.  However, political instability and the failure of the EU to solidify its member states into a coherent whole leaves the US virtually unchallenged as the world's leading currency.  At the least sign of trouble, the flight to safety lands disproportionately on Treasuries.  The political instability caused by the GOP threatens to place US sovereign wealth dominance in jeopardy, something absolutely unthinkable a mere generation ago.  Once again, the world may return to being flat and six thousand years old, just due to the sheer insoluble stupidity of the Right.",™

Standard Oil is the most prominent example that comes to mind, which was notorious for annihilating any competition it came by. Had it not been for the breakup, Standard Oil would be worth in excess of a trillion dollars today.

t5_2qh8d,kristianmae,1382273325,"Honestly, makeup counters are very helpful in showing you what products look good on you and they will explain everything they are doing to your face. Typically they will apply makeup for free--especially if you tell them it's your first time. I like Clinique--they have a lot of different makeup for different face-types. I for one am very stress acne prone, so they have products that work for my skin type.   Personally though, I really like Bare Minerals. If you have a store by you, they also do ""free"" makeovers with the expectation that you buy stuff. A [starter foundation kit](http://www.bareescentuals.com/Get-Started®-Kits/BE_SUB_STARTER,default,sc.html) is usually between 40-60 dollars, and it has everything you need--foundation, blush, bronzer, a top coat powder, and all of the brushes and it will last for quite a while. They also usually have a kit for ""glamour"" too--eye shadows, mascara, lip gloss, and what not. This one is usually cheaper ~$30. They will apply it all so you can see how you look. It's very good for makeup wearers that don't want to look like they are wearing a lot of makeup. It's also not bad for your skin if you are acne prone like me. It is expensive, but it lasts for a very long time.  However, good makeup is expensive, and I honestly am willing to pay for it. You can get similar effects with drug store makeup, and I often buy Almay as a stop gap--they have great eye shadow colors.. But I definitely suggest at least going to a department store first, so they can show you how to apply makeup. From there, you can do some trial and error to see what products work for your face and budget!  Like everyone else says too, you can utilize /r/makeupaddiction and youtube as well! There are tons of great internet resources!",®

t5_2qr4f,iulius,1382276125,"For the lease I'll say it was scary easy to get the 0% financing. With my trade in of like $2k (I sometimes miss my 2001 Ford Focus), it was a $100 difference between leasing and buying, so I bought.  Answering your actual question...  I love mine. I recently had a loaner Chevy Captiva, and the difference in fit and finish, pep in the engine and overall styling was night and day. I test drove a lot of cars in that segment—Kia Sportage, Hyundai Santa Fe, Nissan Murano / Rogue, Toyota Venza, Ford Edge—and none ""fit"" like the Tig. I also test drove an Audi Q5. Don't do that unless you can afford it😃.  The bad:  The Bluetooth speakerphone blows. My wife won't even talk to me unless I take it off of hands free mode. She says she can't understand a thing I say.   It's expensive to fix. I've never been in an accident before this year when I've been in two. Damn car is like an other car magnet. First one someone clipped the end of my tire while I was stopped and had my tire turned to go around a guy. That was a $6000 fix. Second time I was stopped at a red light and was rear ended. Replacing the little panel below the trunk took 10 days and $1100. I didn't pay for either, but it made me drive much more carefully.  Premium gas only. Here in WI, that's another $.40 per gallon.   Other stuff that you see in lower price classes for other cars requires the Premium package. Automatic lights at dark (this one surprised me when I got it home…didn't even think that would be a premium thing in hunks day and age).

t5_2sokd,oscaradrianzen,1382280194,"Chicago resident- I live on a predominantly Latino/white neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. Growing up in CPS was tough enough. I transferred many schools when I was younger because price of rent, my family was pretty poor. Each school year new school. And trust me not all the schools I went to were Latino/white half were all black I stuck out being the few Latinos. Anyways each year I would have too kind of Assume my role as the new kid and take some shit from the other kids; to a certain point. Sometimes on the way back home from school I would get in fights just so the next day I could say ""hey you see that kid over there, I whooped his ass!"" Boom new friends made. I was sort of an alpha male among kids. As I got older this started to spread to some of the local gangs and one of the 8th graders (Latin kings) approached me to be in the gang when I got to be his age. To prove he wasn't a punk he pulled out a gun and shot at a couple of black kids down the street. At the time it was kind of normal for me to see a gun. But to actually shoot at someone was a step I hardly came across. This scared the living shit outta me.. The tension between gangs in Chicago is serious. You don't fuck around when it comes to you gang or colors. And when your approached by other gangs and your not reppin they will kill you for being a flake. It's Peoples vs Folks in Chicago no eastside vs west side . Like most cities it all depends on which block you live on. If you don't know which area gang you reside in check your alley 😉  TL:DR Grew up in Chicago, violence started young. Gangs Recruited early and have no sense for life. ",😉

t5_2rjys,LosWackos,1382282308,"  Also happens to me, basically i deleted everything and reinstalled the game and patches, what might have happened was that you save file has been corrupted.. anyways i can get by the loading screens now, but the game freezes for me all the time. also asked rockstar if they had a solution and this is what they answered.  Hello,  Thanks for contacting Rockstar Support.  We're sorry to hear that you're having issues with GTA V on PS3. Below you will find some Console Troubleshooting steps which may help resolve the issue. These are the official troubleshooting steps provided by Sony on their support site:  Before troubleshooting, please check the following:  a. Turn the console off and on.  b. Unplug all power cords and accessories, and then plug them back in firmly. Make sure all connections are secure.  c. Update your console software.   1.) Clearing the Game Data Utility:  a. In the XMB home menu, go to (Game) &gt; [Game Data Utility]. Important: Make sure you select [Game Data Utility]. Do NOT select [Saved Data Utility], as this will delete all of your saved games files.  b. Highlight the game data utility file (i.e., name of a particular game you have been playing) you wish to delete.  c. Press the button and select [Delete].  d. Highlight ""Yes"" and press the button to confirm the deletion.  e. A message indicating the file is being deleted will appear.  f. A ""Delete completed."" message will appear once the file has been successfully deleted.  g. Once all of the files have been deleted, go back to the XMB home menu.  h. Reboot the game. You should be prompted to reinstall.   **Please note, if the game freezes during installation, please check the following article: http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200195537-Freezing-during-GTA-V-installation-  2.) Ensure your PS3s firmware is up to date (settings &gt; system update - on the main menu).  3.) Restore File System If it is up to date then once again delete the game data.  Next follow the steps below:   a. Turn off Playstation®3.  b. Hold The power button down; The system will turn on and turn off once again.  c. Once the System has been shutdown, re-press you finger until you hear 2 consecutive beeps  d. When you hear the 2 beeps take finger off power button.  e. You will be prompted to plug in your controller via usb and then hit the PS button  f. The Recovery menu will pop up.  g. Select Restore File system  h. Repeat and Rebuild Database  4.) Disconnect your PS3 from the internet. We have gotten reports that some players have been able to resolve their issues by disconnecting their console from the internet. It is possible that some freezes are related to some recent server outages that should be resolved shortly. If issues persist, disabling all internet connections on your console should prevent the game from attempting to access the servers. Obviously this is not ideal, but testing this should work at least for troubleshooting purposes, and should be resolved quickly.   5.) Clear save files.  Some crashes can be related to corrupted save data, especially crashes at a specific spot, or crashes on launch. The next step would be to isolate the save files, and see if launching without them remedies the issue. There are several ways of doing this: a. Deleting all files in the Save Data Utility related to GTA V. Note: This method will result in permanent loss of data. If the game crashed the first time it launched, no valuable information is stored in here, so they may be deleted freely. If you already played the game for many hours, you may want to consider trying another method. b. Backing up all Save Data Utility files on an external device before deleting all files as described above. c. Possibly the simplest method, and one that also might isolate other potential issues would be to test the game from a brand new PSN ID/Profile. The save files for PS3 games are tied to a specific user. Launching from a new user should cause the game to pull from a brand new pool of files.  5.) Install the game to a new section of the Hard Drive. Another possible troubleshooting step would be to attempt to install the game to a new section of the hard drive.  Typically, when installing, and reinstalling games, the system will attempt to reinstall over the same block of space on the HDD.  While there is no function to manually force the game to install on a different block of space, there is one possible workaround that might force the game to install on a new section.  Basically, what we are going to do is uninstall the game, clear the cache, and then install some unrelated data to the Hard Drive, which should get installed to the block of space where GTA V was previously installing.  Please try the following:   a. Uninstall the game from the Games and Apps folder.  Delete everything related to GTA V that is  not a save file.  b. Clear the system cache, as was described above.  c. Install about 7-8GB of unrelated content.  If you have your console connected to the internet, the simplest thing here would be to download a bunch of demos from PSN.  The content is   unimportant, you never even have to play the demos, the point here is to just eat up some hard drive space, and when you reinstall GTA V, force the console to install the game to a section that was not previously used.  If you do not have a a connection, installing 10-12 music CDs should use up enough space, although more might be needed.  The idea here is to try to use up approximately the same amount of space as GTA V's install, which is about 8.5GB.  d. Reinstall GTA V, and see if conditions improve.  6.) Test the game on a second console, or new hard drive.  This last step is potentially the trickiest step, depending on alternate hardware availability, but probably the most important step for determining the cause of major issues on any console. That step would be to test the disc on a separate console. If you have a friend or family member with a PS3, we strongly recommend installing the game on their console, and see if issues persist.  If you continue to have issues, please let us know the following:  The model of your Playstation 3 The size of your hard drive, How much free space is available The contents of any error code, if applicable. If possible, please submit a screen shot of any error messages, or give the presice wording of the error.  Please also provide us with a detailed summary of which of the above steps you were able to try, and details on what effects they had. Additionally, if you were able to try it in another console and the same issue occurred, please provide the model/HD size, etc. of the second system you tested the game on.  Once we receive this information, we will continue to investigate.  Best Regards,  Brian J",®

t5_2qhds,CaerBannog,1382285573,"The Citizens Hearing was, sadly, a circus.   It was not a real congressional hearing.   The former members of Congress who oversaw it were all *paid to do so*, and none of them have a particularly high level of credibility. I'm being polite.  Of the witnesses, some are important and believable. Unfortunately, though, most were not in the least bit believable and were [definitely on the deeply cracked side of mental function](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1330718.1367323108!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/citizen-hearing-disclosure-e-t.jpg).  The cranks who appeared only serve to undermine the credibility of the serious witnesses - *and all of us* - and this is why I am deeply troubled by this project.  The last hearing was a total failure in getting media attention and making people take the subject seriously. Google Trends recorded a decrease in online interest in the term ""UFO"" during the proceedings. This is on the internet, where UFOs are one of the most popular subjects, and the hearing made it *less* popular.   As to whether ""aliens exist"" - it is without doubt that intelligent extraterrestrial species exist in the cosmos.   The question is whether they are coming here.   These hearings can't and don't prove this, and I don't believe they influence sensible people to re-evaluate the question - rather the opposite.   I think it's long past time we threw out the cranks, crystal gazers, cultists and True Believers™ from UFO research and knuckled down to a hardcore, reason-based and stringently logical appraisal of the evidence. We don't need Basset, Greer or any of the other hucksters to do that. ",™

My husband had been building up resentments against me because I was so depressed he felt like I was too fragile to handle discussing important things.  Seemingly all of a sudden, he couldn't handle the resentment anymore and he left me.  I was devastated, I lost 20 lbs and was underweight, I was grieving in the fullest sense of the word.  It was brutal, the worst pain I've ever felt.  In that moment it felt like I would never be the same, like I was all used up and no one would ever love me again.  My life as I knew it was over.  But I worked with a therapist, took it one day at a time, and somehow kept going.  You can too.  Take good care of yourself.  Love yourself as best you can.

This Ducks team is very good, if they can get their PP clicking they'll be well over 3.0 GPG.  **Canucks/Jackets....UNDER 5.5**  ✔ Surprise pick perhaps for some...I like Canucks ML, but I'd rather take the under.  Jackets have scored 6 in 4 games and 10 in 5.  That still puts them at just 2.0 GPG for that stretch.  Canucks actually will have been more rested than Columbus and both backups are playing. I didn't see a whole lot in the attack from CBJ on Saturday and Gaborik was invisible.  I liked Lack's game against Calgary earlier in the season even though he gave up 4, I think he plays a bit better in this one and Canucks win lets say....2-1?",✔

t5_2qhbp,goingandcoming,1382298803,"The word madhhab is derived from an Arabic word meaning ""to go"" or ""to take as a way"", and refers to a mujtahids choice in regard to a number of interpretive possibilities in deriving the rule of Allah from the primary texts of the Qur'an and hadith on a particular question. In a larger sense, a madhhab represents the entire school of thought of a particular mujtahid Imam, such as Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shafi'i, or Ahmad--together with many first-rank scholars that came after each of these in their respective schools, who checked their evidences and refined and upgraded their work. The mujtahid Imams were thus explainers, who operationalized the Qur'an and sunna in the specific shari'a rulings in our lives that are collectively known as fiqh or ""jurisprudence"". In relation to our din or ""religion"", this fiqh is only part of it, for the religious knowledge each of us possesses is of three types. The first type is the general knowledge of tenets of Islamic belief in the oneness of Allah, in His angels, Books, messengers, the prophethood of Muhammad (Allah bless him and give him peace), and so on. All of us may derive this knowledge directly from the Qur'an and hadith, as is also the case with a second type of knowledge, that of general Islamic ethical principles to do good, avoid evil, cooperate with others in good works, and so forth. Every Muslim can take these general principles, which form the largest and most important part of his religion, from the Qur'an and hadith.   The third type of knowledge is that of the specific understanding of particular divine commands and prohibitions that make up the shari'a. Here, because of both the nature and the sheer number of the Qur'an and hadith texts involved, people differ in the scholarly capacity to understand and deduce rulings from them. But all of us have been commanded to live them in our lives, in obedience to Allah, and so Muslims are of two types, those who can do this by themselves, and they are the mujtahid Imams; and those who must do so by means of another, that is, by following a mujtahid Imam, in accordance with Allahs word in surat al-Nahl, ""**Ask those who recall, if you know not**"" (Qur'an 16:43), and in surat al-Nisa, ""**If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those of authority among them, then those of them whose task it is to find it out would have known the matter**"" (Qur'an 4:83), in which the phrase those of them whose task it is to find it out, expresses the words **""alladhina yastanbitunahu minhum""**, referring to those possessing the capacity to draw inferences directly from the evidence, which is called in Arabic ""istinbat"".   These and other verses and hadiths oblige the believer who is not at the level of istinbat or directly deriving rulings from the Qur'an and hadith to ask and follow someone in such rulings who is at this level. It is not difficult to see why Allah has obliged us to ask experts, for if each of us were personally responsible for evaluating all the primary texts relating to each question, a lifetime of study would hardly be enough for it, and one would either have to give up earning a living or give up ones din, which is why Allah says in surat al-Tawba, in the context of jihad:  **""Not all of the believers should go to fight. Of every section of them, why does not one part alone go forth, that the rest may gain knowledge of the religion and admonish their people when they return, that perhaps they may take warning""** (Qur'an 9:122).  The slogans we hear today about ""following the Qur'an and sunna instead of following the madhhabs"" are wide of the mark, for everyone agrees that we must follow the Qur'an and the sunna of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace). The point is that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) is no longer alive to personally teach us, and everything we have from him, whether the hadith or the Qur'an, has been conveyed to us through Islamic scholars. So it is not a question of whether or not to take our din from scholars, but rather, from which scholars. And this is the reason we have madhhabs in Islam: because the excellence and superiority of the scholarship of the mujtahid Imams--together with the traditional scholars who followed in each of their schools and evaluated and upgraded their work after them--have met the test of scholarly investigation and won the confidence of thinking and practicing Muslims for all the centuries of Islamic greatness. The reason why madhhabs exist, the benefit of them, past, present, and future, is that they furnish thousands of sound, knowledge-based answers to Muslims questions on how to obey Allah. Muslims have realized that to follow a madhhab means to follow a super scholar who not only had a comprehensive knowledge of the Qur'an and hadith texts relating to each issue he gave judgements on, but also lived in an age a millennium closer to the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) and his Companions, when taqwa or ""godfearingness"" was the norm--both of which conditions are in striking contrast to the scholarship available today.   While the call for a return to the Qur'an and sunna is an attractive slogan, in reality it is a great leap backward, a call to abandon centuries of detailed, case-by-case Islamic scholarship in finding and spelling out the commands of the Qur'an and sunna, a highly sophisticated, interdisciplinary effort by mujtahids, hadith specialists, Qur'anic exegetes, lexicographers, and other masters of the Islamic legal sciences. To abandon the fruits of this research, the Islamic shari'a, for the following of contemporary sheikhs who, despite the claims, are not at the level of their predecessors, is a replacement of something tried and proven for something at best tentative.   The rhetoric of following the shari'a without following a particular madhhab is like a person going down to a car dealer to buy a car, but insisting it not be any known make--neither a Volkswagen nor Rolls- Royce nor Chevrolet--but rather ""a car, pure and simple"". Such a person does not really know what he wants; the cars on the lot do not come like that, but only in kinds. The salesman may be forgiven a slight smile, and can only point out that sophisticated products come from sophisticated means of production, from factories with a division of labor among those who test, produce, and assemble the many parts of the finished product. It is the nature of such collective human efforts to produce something far better than any of us alone could produce from scratch, even if given a forge and tools, and fifty years, or even a thousand. And so it is with the shari'a, which is more complex than any car because it deals with the universe of human actions and a wide interpretive range of sacred texts. This is why discarding the monumental scholarship of the madhhabs in operationalizing the Qur'an and sunna in order to adopt the understanding of a contemporary sheikh is not just a mistaken opinion. It is scrapping a Mercedes for a go-cart.  - © Nuh Ha Mim Keller, 1995  Tl;dr: Read the text above.",©

t5_2r6rj,SirElectricSheep,1382316910,"I watched the video, it was 45 minutes of some guy telling his *True Story*™ of how he went from a lovable loser to a playboy Hef would be proud of.  So no one else has to sit through this nonsense, it starts with a standard introduction, 'Here's my product, pls buy pls', and then he explains how he isn't just a salesmen, but actually a customer as well. He explains how he used this super secret technique to get girls and how you have to act *right now* because scientists, I'm assuming the Imperial Science Counsel, have declared this technique leaked and are pressing for the website to be taken down. And then he starts his story.  Our good Narrator went on a date with this nice girl name Amanda. They had everything in common. And then his birthday came and Amanda was late to his party. When she handed him his present, she added that she'll give him he rest of it later that night, something he proceeded to tell all his friends in excitement. Then this guy Jake starts acting up and jumps on his brand new white couch, leaving boot marks in the cushion. The narrator tells us that in high school Jake's nickname was literally 'Jake the Jerk'. Jake is an overweight man missing two teeth from an unrelated fight and balding at eighteen. The Narrator leaves in the middle of his own Birthday party to buy cleaning supplies for the sofa. When he comes home, Amanda is gone and everybody is acting odd. His buddy Tommy eventually tells him that Amanda left with Jake the Jerk. The trusting narrator tells Tommy that he's full of shit and calls he mobile, where on the third ring, she answers and feeds the narrator and excuse while Jake the Jerk is shouting in the background. The narrator is quite confused, and explains how despite the fact that he was the right choice on paper, Amanda still went for Jake the Jerk. He makes a vow to figure out attraction and writes and signs a piece of paper he carries around.  Then the narrator starts talking about how he now has women approaching him, how he dates women that are 'usually reserved for rockstars and celebrities', and how he is now seeing three women who are fighting with each other over being the official girlfriend of Mister Narrator. He tells us about how he figured it all leafing through a local newspaper that talks about how a team of '[sic]renegade scientists' discovered a way to flip a switch in a female's mind so that some kind of addictive chemical' was released that would cause uncontrollable attraction. He tells how he thought it was bullshit until he recognised the name of renowned researcher, Doctor Robert Epstein, PhD. He learns that the scientists were working on a way to develop undetectable mindreading tactics based on what the CIA uses secretly; they codenamed it ""Project: Pandora's Box"". This information was super duper tippity top secret until a good Samaritan, Vin DiCarlo, who worked on project used it to turn his life around and share it with the world with the nifty website where they sell this.  He then goes on about all the ways you can manipulate women with Pandora's Box and starts talking getting into some weird primal mind control stuff which I've taken screenshots of the best bits [here](http://imgur.com/a/RFgdZ) along with [these](http://imgur.com/a/ApRLS) wonderfully ironic statements.

t5_2qh2v,KarmishMafia,1382327672,"&gt; they aren't doing this for any values, they just want to say fuck you to the CCP for whatever reason.  Just your unsubstantiated opinion - it's like you think we're children in a playground and the CCP is the poor little defenseless kid being unjustly kicked around for being different. It's ridiculous, make no mistake; the CCP is still a brutal one party dictatorship, that usurped power by force in a civil war and then wrought death and destruction on the Chinese people and culture for more than thirty years, don't think they've changed much - they're still completely paranoid and suspicious of their own people and they won't think twice about using violence against them to preserve their power for power's sake. But this is beside the point;  They come up for so much criticism because ultimately they're responsible for the deteriorating quality of life in HK. That old HK wasn't free before 97 while technically true is irrelevant - The pre-97 govt realized the way forward was a level playing field and since the 1970s it constantly took progressive steps to stamp out corruption, uphold the rule of law and put the framework in place to move towards a representative democracy; culminating in the joint-declaration where BJ agreed and signed into law that HK was to have representative government by way of universal suffrage, since 97 it has stagnated because of BJ plain and simple.   &gt;using the fight for democracy/free speech as an avenue for their outrage against the CCP. think about that hypocrisy and the very degradation that brings to these said values.  Even if that's true in a small minority of cases there's no hypocrisy or degradation of values there - if you're fighting for democracy its natural to be outraged by an unelected govt.   &gt;what makes it even more infuriating is that protestors take any hint, even the slightest as an interpretation that beijing is intervening/changing hong kong to become an authoritarian city, and taking all rights away.  The only people that seem to have HKs best interests at heart are HK'ers - why is it infuriating if people are defending their way of life?   &gt;but when you look at the big picture, your rights are still by all measures well respected. you are under rule of law, protected by law  Well, you've missed the point of this demonstration entirely - the govts decision here broke all sorts of rules - that's the whole point. That's why people took to the streets - in HK the Govt has no right to say ""he's not getting a license and we're not telling you why, even though he followed the application to the letter and was the only legitmate candidate. Bye now."" The SAR Govt must justify their decision under the established rules and procedures for applying for a free-TV license. The whole thing stinks to high heaven and ticks all the boxes for the rot that is seeping into the system:   Pandering to the Tycoon class, possible collusion and nepotism ☑   Arbitrarily shifting the goalposts ☑   Contradicting published govt policies ☑   Decisions regarding the public being made in a black box ☑   Outside interference from the relevant national ministries ☑   No justification given ☑      ",☑

t5_2sgq6,writingstones,1382345261,"It's spelled Singapore, by the way, not Singapour. And we do have quite a few gaming and animation companies here. Lambdamu, the creators of Pixel People; Lucasfilm, with ""recent projects include Star Wars™ The Clone Wars™: Jedi Alliance™ for the Nintendo DS platform, Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge for iPhone, iPhone Touch, Xbox LIVE and Playstation 3 as well as work on The Force Unleashed II"".  Personally, I've played quite a few Hidden Object games and I enjoy them a lot. The writing varies between games of course, but the plot is engaging and reads almost like a visual novel in some instances. The dialogue can be a little cheesy at times, but there's a lot of humour in most of them. I like Hidden Object games because I like to read as well, and I mainly play games for the story-telling component. I dislike it when there's a boss in a game I find it difficult to get through, because I feel like I'm wasting my time when I really just want to get on with the story.  Thank you for bringing to my attention the Extra Credits show. I didn't seem to catch that one. And I agree with the show. I didn't realise that the female characters were actually pretty well written until I saw that. I can relate to them or what they're going through, which might be why they're fun for me. When I see games like GTA V, I don't really feel the same connection because of the way the females are handled. That's not to say it's a bad game, since it is still fun, but in a different way.  A lot of the games usually deal with relationships of the main character's past, usually with her parents. Whether she's on the search for them or whether she's uncovering more of what they were as human beings. It's fun for me because I like to see what different people are like underneath. The mystery ones where we get to move a magnifying glass or dust for prints are also engaging as well. I also like looking at the backgrounds since they usually spend quite a bit of time drawing it since we revisit scenes.  Plus, at least one guy in the game will be appealing to me. Or if there aren't any guys and just one girl on a journey, at least I can get through the story and vegetate on the couch clicking away. It's extremely relaxing not to think too much at the end of a long day and just search for a perfume bottle or a baguette.",™

t5_2xgf6,TooManyInLitter,1382365551,"So ""Anon"" writes to WLC that Christian Faith is hard, that non-Christian literature brings up issues/points that ""doesn't make much sense"" to support a creator, nor intervening, deity. And ends the message with an apparent heartfelt ""Please, I want to believe in God, any suggestions?""  And WLC responds with a (paraphrased) - 'As a Christian, you are not doing it right' multi-paragraph rant.  Apparently the right way is to immerse oneself ONLY with good Christian literature and sources (with an apparent emphasis on WLC's own web site) to gain a healthy ~~confirmation bias~~ ~~self-indoctrination~~ ~~set of pro-Christian arguments~~ understanding of being a True Christian™. /s  This gem was interesting - ""Do we forget that there is an enemy of our souls who hates us intensely, is bent on our destruction, and will use anything he can to undermine our faith or render us ineffective in God’s hands?""  I am assuming that this is a reference to The Adversary of Yahweh, the Devil, Satan, Old Scotch, rather than an attack against those nasty atheists that ""Anon"" referenced in his message.  An application of the doctrine of installing fear - very nice Mr. WLC.  So this person is asking for help in believing in God, and WLC invokes another supernatural deity that ""Anon"" must also, somehow, develop Faith to believe in? I would say that this will not be a productive approach.  WLC then throws out some pointers/links to arguments for ""God,"" and though I did not examine the specific arguments made, based upon the names of the arguments, they conclude with a deistic or pantheistic God rather than the God of Abraham, or monotheistic Yahwehism.  So much for ""Anon"" getting a handle on the Christian God Yahweh. Finally some Christian references are thrown in that advocate that Jesus is Divine.  There was nary an attempt to present a link/citation to any reference(s) that would present a balanced approach to the examination of the arguments/position for and against the existence of ""God,"" nope, WLC just displays the conceit that WLC is right.  If I were a doubting Christian, and I was at one time, I would find WLC's response to be disingenuous, contemptuous, sanctimonious, and hypocritically smug and pious. If I would have received such a response during my doubting phase from such a well known name in Christian apologetics, my journey to deism/pantheism and then to agnostic atheist, would have been significantly reduced.

t5_2qh9z,lynne14,1382369848,"THREE STEPS TO BEGIN THE ART OF LOVING YOURSELF • Be gentle with yourself. •Be forgiving •Be accepting [not to be confused with resignation]  BE GENTLE WITH YOURSELF  My experiences have shown low self-esteem and body image issues generally create unrealistic expectations. You expect far too much and set goals, targets etc, that are unrealistic and cannot be reached.  When failure occurs then you’re able to say to yourself, ‘There I knew it.  I'm useless and can’t ever do anything’. So in a way it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Say you want to lose weight.  So you set yourself a target which is high and then when you fall short, it’s the same thing: ‘There I knew it.  I told you so. I'm useless and can never do anything’. You’re not doing this on purpose.  It’s most likely you’re not even aware you’re doing it.  You might read this and say to yourself, ‘Well at least I don’t do that, thank goodness’! But you know what?  It’s quite possible you do. Either way what I'm suggesting is leave perfection to those who are perfect and good luck to them! The rest of us can be realistic about who we are and what we can achieve.  So when setting targets / goals be gentle on yourself – be considerate of who you are and make it realistic.  So instead of setting yourself up for failure, for a change you can set yourself-up for success! Be a winner, for once in your life, be a winner and enjoy it. By suggesting you lower your target/goal to something more realistic – I don’t mean to make it easy.  That wouldn't be sensible nor an achievement. What I mean is make it something you still have to struggle and stretch to reach – but it is actually doable.  It must be achievable. Not a plan or target so high it cannot be achieved by anyone.  Not even a professional specialising in that field. Okay – do you get that? Are you ready to begin setting new targets – ones that you can reach with a bit of effort and energy? Good. Go for it and start celebrating life as a winner!  BE FORGIVING - ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE IMPERFECT  forgive-red-text-on-white-backgroundThe idea you have of perfection which you try so hard to reach was probably not your idea.  It’s most likely placed in your mind by somebody else when you were younger. I can’t say for sure unless I knew a bit about you – but I'm sure you didn't wake-up one morning and say to yourself, ‘You know what; from now on I'm going to be perfect’ It doesn't work like that. I'm not sure how helpful it is to dwell on where you got it from, it’s enough to know that you’re having to be perfect in all things. That’s a heavy burden to bear - and causes all type of stress and anxiety. A less harsh way of living would be to develop tolerance toward all your mistakes and errors. In most cases there are loads of ways around the mistake to the point where it doesn't even matter any more. In other instances what at first seems a massive mistake turns out either not an error at all, or it works out for the best and is an improvement over the first effort. Try to be flexible in life.  Remember it is better to bend with the wind  than be broken by it.  BE ACCEPTING OF YOURSELF WARTS AND ALL  acceptance-concept-blue-sky-backgroundAcceptance is not to be confused with resignation.   Resignation is a reluctant agreement to a situation or event. The acceptance I mean is a creative acknowledgement of whatever it is that has taken place, or happened.  It’s an acceptance of whatever has taken place in your life even though you may not have wanted it or desired it. But you have said to yourself, ‘Okay this isn't what I wanted but it’s happened and its okay – I’ll go with it’. So acceptance is the way forward to when the wheels fall off whatever it is you’re doing and quietly saying to yourself, ‘It’s not what I planned.  But it’s happened.  What can I do now to go forward?’ Acceptance is not just about what happens to you in life.  There’s a bigger concept than that.  It relates to the way you view yourself.  If you were to look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself: ‘Okay, every part of me isn't the way I want, but I accept myself and can go with it’. If you could do that you would feel as if a great burden has been lifted from your shoulders and you would feel lighter immediately. So to sum-up there are three ways you can begin practising the Art of Loving Yourself. They are: • Be gentle with yourself. •Be forgiving •Be accepting [not to be confused with resignation]  These three things are referred to as steps for a reason. Steps are one foot at a time. Although everything sounds deceptively simple – it’s not.  Remember your thinking has developed a certain way over a lifetime.  So it will take time to begin new ways of thinking. Don’t expect to change overnight it needs patience. Be gentle always with yourself and always forgive yourself when you make mistakes. Whatever stage you’re at accept yourself warts and all!  WEEKLY AFFIRMATION:  When I look in the mirror, I see a loving person. My capacity to love knows no boundaries. I accept myself and love what I see in the mirror. There are no imperfections because I am perfectly constructed. I am an example of a miracle and a spiritual work in progress.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED worldwide.

It sets precedents for how many women/blacks/whatever you need to have for tax breaks among other things such as government funding (as in the college which accepts 90% men since they are the most intelligent wouldn't receive government funding)  &gt;Are you saying companies should have the right to refuse to hire women?

Then you claim all of those things are irrelevant? How so? They're irrelevant because YOU'RE AFRAID OF ADMITTING WHAT THEY MEAN!  I'm saying that The Patriarchy™ doesn't exist outside of Feminist hubs.  &gt;Imagine for a second, a world in which almost all politicians were women, All company ceo's were women, and all movies and TV shows were pretty much only about a ton of women, with an occasional man as a background character.  I'd find this world fascinating as it's so different from ours. For instance what made women elect mostly women instead of mostly men into political office like in our world? Why are more women interested in business than men in this world? I could care less about movies and TV for the most part but I somehow can't imagine The Hunt for Red October being very good with Sean Connery recast as Megan Fox.  &gt;Then imagine in this world, you, a man, were paid less than women, treated as weaker and stupider than a woman, and instead of being raised to fight for what you believe in and be strong, you were raised to fear women, to be subservient, and to behave. You were raised to believe you couldn't do the things women could do and you could never do the important jobs they do.  As a man living in North America this isn't hard to imagine at all.  &gt;What would you do in that world?

I know TRP wants to say addiction isn't a disease. I disagree. I think it's entirely curable, but still a disease. And so it's not merely a matter of diet. It's an entire life change that most food addicts can't or won't do.   That said, it's fuck or walk. You either lose weight, or you don't. And if you don't want to, don't complain about it.  ",▶

Yes, that's why the law was created, so that misogynist people like you can't just fill a college with men and refuse all the women because of your bigoted stereotype.  &gt;No. I am saying that being forced to hire someone for being a black woman is just as bad as not hiring someone for being a black woman.  It's either that or let companies just refuse to hire women and black people. Which do you prefer? We have companies right now that if it were legal to, would simply refuse to hire any women and black people. You're ok with that?  &gt;I'm saying that The Patriarchy™ doesn't exist outside of Feminist hubs.  You just don't understand what it is. Almost all politicians are men, including every president we've ever had. You don't think that affects women? There's proof it does because women are having to fight for the rights to contraceptives, the right to abortion, even the right to vote is still challenged in sneaky ways!  Almost all big companies CEOS are men, business is run by men, and women are on average, paid less. If you were paid less because of your gender, you might care.  Movies and television are male dominated, Have you heard of the bechdel test? To pass the test, a movie has to have two women who talk to each other about something besides a man. 50% of movies fail that test. Can you think of any that would fail it if it were about men instead? Do you think that doesn't affect women?  &gt;I'd find this world fascinating as it's so different from ours. For instance what made women elect mostly women instead of mostly men into political office like in our world? Why are more women interested in business than men in this world?   A good question, one we should be asking in our world about men and women. Do you know the answers?  &gt;I could care less about movies and TV for the most part but I somehow can't imagine The Hunt for Red October being very good with Sean Connery recast as Megan Fox.  Talk about a sexist straw man. I can't imagine it being very good with Shia Labeouf either. I think there are plenty of female actors who could pull it off though. Helen Mirren or Judy Dench come to mind.  &gt;As a man living in North America this isn't hard to imagine at all.  Really? You know what it's like as a man to grow up being told that lawyers, doctors, mathematicians, scientists, presidents, athletes, pilots, astronauts, soldiers, engineers, writers, and salesman, are all women? And that as a man you should probably start learning how to raise children or do makeup or hair for a living?  &gt;Depends, are the other features of this world also mimicking yours?  What would you do?  &gt;I'd close the book because luckily I know that world is a fantasy one way or the other.  You don't want to answer? You don't have an answer?",™

If you have moderate or strict NAT, the problem you describe is most likely caused by a conflict with another player using an incompatible NAT type. Microsoft recommends an open NAT Type to connect with players as easily as possible. If you have a firewall or network hardware, such as a router, you might need to make a configuration change in order to obtain an open NAT.

If you have a firewall or network hardware, such as a router, you might need to make a configuration change in order to obtain an open NAT. This configuration change is sometimes called “opening ports” or ""port forwarding.""  **PlayStation®Network and SCEA Game Servers**  All games published by SCEA (first-party) and the PlayStation Network may use the following ports for communication with SCEA (first-party) game servers:  *TCP Ports: 80, 443, 465, 983, 5223, and 10070 - 10080* *UDP Ports: 3478, 3479,  3658, and 10070*  PS3, 360: Some players have found the following website useful for configuring ports with a static IP to attain a more open NAT type with many different router models: http://www.portforward.com  Also try:  1. Make sure your router's firmware is upgraded the latest version (very important).   2. Unplug your router for 10 minutes and plug it back in. Some older routers degrade in performance over time until it is rebooted, similar to a PC.   3. Disable any firewall or other network filtering for the game.   4. Enable or disable uPnP (universal plug and play) on your router or the console settings.  5. If you don't care about security, enable DMZ (de-militarized zone) on your router for your console’s address. This turns off all of your router's firewall features for that specific console.   6. Contact your ISP and ask them what your DNS settings should be.  Check the Primary and Secondary DNS settings on your console.  For more information, see: http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/connectadvance.html, http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connection-error-solution  7. If you have a combination modem/router unit or ADSL, try setting the unit to ""Bridge Mode"" to bypass the router part of the hardware.  If this fixes the issue, then you may be able to connect a second router betwen the combination unit and the console to dial the PPPoE connection.  8. If you use an ADSL connection, see if dialing a PPPoEconnection from the console improves the NAT Type.  Contact your hardware manufacturer manual or ISP for detailed instructions.",®

And being a feminist doesn't necessarily mean you hate men, but supporting the feminist ideology as it exists in the modern day is supporting the hatred of men. Supporting the ideology of Patriarchy Theory™ is in itself misandric, as this theory purports that all men are participants in the subjugation of women, and that men are incapable of being discriminated against due to this participation.  Patriarchy Theory™ takes all the problems of society, exclusively looks at the problems faced by one gender, and places all of the blame on the other. When have you ever heard feminists argue for better treatment of boys in school? When have you ever heard feminists argue against male genital mutilation? When have you ever heard feminists bring up that men on average die younger than women or are way more likely to commit suicide? Because these are things I never see or hear feminism discussing.",™

While you tend to use a MF system in situations where the shooting is patient and calculated, you also have to consider how practical changing a TLR lens would be in spontaneous, casual settings. Changing a lens on my Mamiya RZ is much simpler than doing so on a TLR, but it's not something that I would do on the street unless there was A Fleeting Moment™.  The size/weight difference may seem small on paper, but it's one that would make you hesitate bringing the camera along if you don't have enough space in your bag that day.

t5_2sgq6,masta_solidus,1382392816,"What culture you ask? The culture in which video games has informed and makes up a part of how our minds work. It's more than our enjoyment of games, it's our internalization of games as more than just fun pastimes.  When it comes to other, passive, media, the thing is that people typically don't view their consumption of the content presented in the media as a part of the process. Many of the more fervent, 'hardcore' enthusiasts do, but not the public at large.  It's definitely a part of the process of enjoying a movie to see it in particular settings, but all people who enjoy movies don't care about the setting.  With games, the consumption of the content is ALWAYS involving your activity, in some respect. You actively cause parts of the experience that you internalize, and that in turn affects how the experience resonates with you.  All gamers have some memory or emotion tied to some action in some game. It could be the sound of the 1-up from Mario, the Super Sonic sound when Sonic goes Gold, The perfect reload sound in Gears of War, the sound a pokèball makes when it's JUST about to lock and capture that pokèmon--or something I don't even know.  A person just playing games in a passive--or fad-like--manner won't have emotions tied to the act of gaming.   ...then, you have to consider active passion about games. Not gaming, as a nebulous culture within which gamers live and games are played, but GAMES themselves. Someone that cares about games a lot tends to buy merchandise. Does that mean they are more 'gamer' than those who don't? What is 'more' really? It does mean they want others outside of their gaming life to know about their passion, but it doesn't mean that because of it it renders the people who just love playing a game without getting GamerSwag™ worse or, even non-gamers.  But you hit an interesting point /u/ShadeJackrabbit:  &gt; I want playing games to be normal.  They already ARE. If they weren't, a giant publisher wouldn't be willing to say that non-gamers are a big part of their target market.  Everyone and their mother--literally--plays games at this point.  But not everyone is a gamer, and most people who play games don't consider themselves gamers (yet).  And that's cool.  Does the guy being represented in the Call of Duty ad where he's blowing up shit and making gun noises care that the EFF and TotalBiscuit are working against developers silencing games critique on YouTube? Does he care that certain genres are dying because of a fixation on hitting market demos necessary to justify these huge game development costs?  Probably not. He probably never even considered that stuff. He probably doesn't read gaming blogs, or watch gaming videos, or listen to podcasts. He might get a game magazine, and he definitely sees ads in his other media consumption...so he's amped because he saw a new Call of Duty is dropping.He just wants his killstreaks and his fun MP and his scintillating campaign mode.  The fact he wants those things from a game doesn't make him a gamer though. It does make him a video game player. **But his own ownership of the label is the thing that defines whether or not he is a gamer.** Because everyone does play, only gamers are gamers. Everyone else is a player.  (Honestly, I give Acti a lot of credit for being able to make the distinction. Because they can, it means they see what their product actually is: the equivalent of a Michael Bay flick. No one is arguing Michael Bay is making something particularly meaningful, himself included...but it is what it is and people want that. It happens to share space in a media that does make meaningful things, and has passionate enthusiasts, but it knows it's place.)",™

t5_2qhk3,mediainfidel,1382401814,"&gt; Men's Rights groups don't exist simply to oppose feminists. Men face sexual discrimination in some areas of their lives and sometimes feminists are the cause or working to increase the problem. The only solution is to actively work against feminists in these areas.  I think you're exactly correct here.  The focus shouldn't be anti-feminism per se.  The Men's Rights Movement exists because there are obvious and serious issues unique to men, in which an organized effort is needed to address most effectively.  However, contemporary third wave feminists oppose any effort by men to tackle these issues by themselves.  Today's feminists demand and expect a monopoly when it comes to gender.  They are convinced their ""theories"" are the correct ones.  They believe only they should have the power to shape future gender relations.  Because Patriarchy^®   The reality is, in theory (so to speak), in the abstract, feminists and MRAs are both fighting for the same thing: gender equality.  But of course the struggle is in part over what we mean by ""equality.""  I think for the most part both movements oppose traditional gender roles, despite how feminists paint MRAs as reactionary traditionalists.  The fact of the matter is, third wave feminism has become quite powerful, particularly in media and political organizing (under the banner of equality.  Who's not for that?).  My critical tendencies want to see the MRM as an inevitable result of the rise of third wave feminism, the Hegelian antithesis to feminism's thesis.    This is the struggle.

Not at all, I can consider those pre-council Christians to be Christians because they were counted amongst the early Church and because there weren't definitive pronouncements on what defined a Christian. However Nicaea spelled out once and for all what we should recognize as Christian, after that point we had a clear working definition of Christian.   It is not a ""No true scotsman fallacy"" because I never considered non-Nicene Christians as Christians.  &gt; Ironically the Bible itself tells us about how many Christians didn't even believe that Jesus was a real person  Nowhere in your quote does it state that Christians didn't believe Jesus was a real person. All it says is that Christians were anointed (baptized) and that this was a derogatory term made by pagans (such as Autolycus). Furthermore from you [own source](http://www.ewtn.com/library/patristc/anf2-3.txt) it has this to say:  * But what else is this voice but  the Word of God, who is also His Son? Not as the poets and writers of myths  talk of the sons of gods begotten from intercourse [with women], but as  truth expounds, the Word, that always exists, residing within the heart of  God. For before anything came into being He had Him as a counsellor, being  His own mind and thought. But when God wished to make all that He  determined on, He begot this Word, uttered,(5) the first-born of all  creation, not Himself being emptied of the Word [Reason], but having  begotten Reason, and always conversing with His Reason. And hence the holy  writings teach us, and all the spirit-bearing [inspired] men, one of whom,  John, says, ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,""(6)  showing that at first God was alone, and the Word in Him. Then he says,  ""The Word was God; all things came into existence through Him; and apart  from Him not one thing came into existence."" The Word, then, being God, and  being naturally(7) produced from God, whenever the Father of the universe  wills, He sends Him to any place; and He, coming, is both heard and seen,  being sent by Him, and is found in a place.   Sounds like Theophilus was **well aware** of the existence of Jesus, especially if he quotes the Gospel of John in his reply.  &gt;Christianity today, which doesn't represent Christianity's origins whatsoever is the true version of it, eh?  Christianity today is part of a direct line of Christianity's origins. Especially those Churches which follow apostolic succession.  &gt;Christianity (as in Roman Catholicism and its descendants) is a product of the Roman State, not ""Jesus"".  So the Roman Catholic Church as it existed during the persecutions of Rome was a product of the Roman State? So the Roman Catholic Church under Simon whom Jesus renamed Peter, under the missionary work of Saul who Christ called Paul, under the leadership of James the Just, brother of our Lord who led his Church in Jerusalem was a product of the Roman State?",™

From the works of Alexander Zinoviev, Soviet logician and dissident:  &gt;""For me and my peers liberation from centuries-long slavery had a tremendous significance. We lived through a lot of things: horrific living conditions, arrests and hardship of the war. And yet, I would not trade my life in those days for any other life. Many millions of my peers in those days felt free and realized they were Citizens with a capital C. We gained tremendous knowledge; the entire country was studying. In those days Russia transitioned from the most illiterate into the most educated country. We were given access to the highest cultural achievements. This was our compensation for the poverty of our daily living. Our pants were ripped and patched, we wore no ties, but in our heads we carried something, which to us meant more than any treasures of the material world.""  &gt;A. Zinovievâ€™s family is a vivid testimony to what the revolution gave people. He became a scientist, a professor, his older brother became the head of a factory, other siblings became engineers, one became a colonel and was about to become a general.  &gt;In one of his books A. Zinoviev classifies the features of the Soviet society of the 1930s-50s in the following manner: ""Communist social structure, created in Russian after the revolution of 1917, brought people collectivism, guaranteed satisfaction of their basic needs, opportunities to improve their life situation with the help of their own abilities, their own labour and decent behaviour in a collective. In the eternal debate: ""To have or to be?"" many millions of people preferred ""to be"" while being satisfied with only a minimal ""to have"". The Russians attempted to create a system of higher values, superior to the ones they called petty bourgeois and low. Among these values are moral and spiritual perfectionism, serving the collective, self-sacrifice in the name of the society, self-restriction and others. Many sincere followers of such system of values appeared. Thanks to them many historic heroic acts were accomplished and unprecedented results were achieved. A layer of educated and created personalities was formed who lived in material poverty, but read, thought, discussed and wrote. They did not strive for fame or career. They were satisfied with the reputation within their immediate circle.""  &gt;A. Zinoviev could recognize true communists: ""Such true communist was my uncle. During the civil war he was a commissar of a military division, later â€“ a party worker. While holding these responsible positions, all his life him and his family lived in one room and never asked for an apartment. All his life he wore one trench coat. My oldest brother was the same. He and his wife were given a tiny little apartment only when he became the head of a factory and a regional Soviet deputy. There were many people like them. I think our country survived mainly because there were such people.""",™

t5_2qh13,BuckeyeSundae,1382426101,"&gt;Hopefully we'll come to the conclusion that this is indeed world news (as it is IMO), but it's not for me to unilaterally say.   This is the offending line.  In one line of text, the mod communicated (1) s/he disagrees with the current action and therefore agrees with The People™ and (2) s/he is fighting for The People's™ preferred resolution.  The reason this line exists is in support of a valid reason someone shouldn't necessarily unsubscribe because of this controversy (""don't unsubscribe because there is substantial debate on this topic internally; I'm personally fighting for you"").  It is not integral to the main point of the mod's argument, but it is included anyway.  Now in the main I agree that without that line the response is quite decent.  If this mod had not gone so far as to actually overtly put that stake in the sand publicly, I'd have zero problem with the post and be largely supportive of that response.  But because s/he did make a public stand, s/he has made the internal debate an external debate.  That subverts efforts to peaceably resolve the disagreement by intentionally further opening up the disagreement to outside pressure.  It throws poison into the discussion.  Unnecessary and unproductive poison.  Mods are people too.  If you attack them directly through witch hunts or circlejerks, they will get defensive and harden their positions.  Those hardened positions will generally make them less able to reach common ground with people who disagree with them--I'm talking on an emotional level, and sometimes despite their best intentions.  But many members of reddit communities don't appreciate this fact and take to attacking moderators for the decisions they make, assuming that this mode of response will have a high chance of success.  It usually doesn't work.  When an animal feels backed into a corner, they don't back down; they lash out.  Humans are no different.",™

Redundancy ♥  Our teacher Mr. L decides to get married the week of our HS midterm. He tells us that he wont be there to administer the test cause hes gonna be with his wife. but that he expects us to act like if he was there. Uhhhh yea not gonna happen. The day comes and I havent prepared shit for this test. The second the sub hands out all the tests I get up and start moving desks around saying to the class ""alright everyone get in your groups"". Our sub Mr. D (a cool ass old guy) went up and asked me what I was doing I told him Mr. L had assigned groups. Which everyone seemed to be getting in, except the smart kids.... luckily they didnt foil my plan. The whole period of collaborative work gone to waste by just talking it up. Class ends I grab my paper and head out the sub asks where im going. I tell him that Mr. L extends the time for midterm tests. He buys it. Try to finish it by lunch. I FAIL. Never turned it in.   I swear I cant make this shit up reddit lol  Next day we find out Mr. L finds out what happened. Doesnt know who did it though. He walks into the class super pissed and takes 20mins to begin talking.

And only ~10 years before that all forms of contraception were illegal. [Read more of Ireland's family planning history](http://www.ifpa.ie/node/82). I use that as an example of *how* conservative and religious Ireland was at the time. And yet, a female president *was* elected.  The people &amp; institutions who were opposed to contraception (basically the Roman Catholic Church) were also in favour of women being automatically fired when they got married (repealed in the ~1970s), and opposed to divorce in all cases (even ""my husband is trying to kill me""), opposed to any form of marital rape (at the time Robinson was elected it was still impossible to charge a man with rape if he raped his wife), opposed to barring orders against abusive husbands (""you can't deny a man access to his family!"").  *(I should point out that Ireland is a parliamentary democracy, not a presidential democracy.

t5_2s30g,A_for_Anonymous,1382438550,"&gt; Is political ideology, upbringing and geographical location influencing factors on how we see violence?  No, but education is. Some people become experienced; some experienced people become wise and realize violence is not a good way to solve personal problems. When you have good education channels and well educated people are in power, this insight is heard and spread.  For example, Switzerland has tiny cities, is mostly rural, and absolutely against violence and war. It's also one of the few truly democratic countries.  &gt; Now, I admit that when a man tells me that his first instinct instinct is to run and/or call the cops, I see him as less of a man, a coward even.  He can't be less of a man because he's male. You're pulling a No True Scottsman fallacy. Men are not more or less manly, or more or less courageous, depending on if they share your violent views or not. It's also valiant to choose a non-violent solution and be concerned for personal safety knowing that people like you will insult them for it.  &gt; If you're not willing to stand up for yourself, how can you stand up for what you believe in?  There are more ways to fight than to just use violence. For example, getting the opponent jailed is more effective in the long term.  Your philosophy (so to speak) of ""standing up for yourself"" is also flawed: it only works if you're the strongest person in the world. Are you? If you are not, you'll eventually get your ass kicked and walk away heavily injured if you walk away at all.  &gt; I realize that it's not my place to place judgement on other people  But you do exactly that. You're calling them cowards and less of a man.  &gt; When push comes to shove, you want a Conservative government in power. You may not agree with their beliefs, but you know they'll go the distance to keep the country protected.  This is the usual conservative trap. They claim to defend MURRICA's Freedom™, but in reality, they just sell the country to its corporations even more shamelessly than the other guy.  The reason why any capitalist politician (be it your democrats or your republicans) does anything is economic. Democrats want to sell the power to corporations, but still keep somewhat of a state, which gets always horribly indebted from war. Republicans want to sell the entire state to corporations and turn your Congress into the Marlboro Halliburton Mountain Dew Public Business Center, and they pick wars because it's a fantastic way to direct public (i.e. tax, YOUR tax) money into private pockets (e.g. Boeing), which makes shareholders happy; who cares if their own soldiers die for their business interests (oh but they're HEROES — look at how the Lockheed Martin shares skyrocketed!). Democrats are also smarter than republicans (not that you have to be a genius to be so) and realize that the public image of the United Corporations of America elsewhere has a commercial value too, and that it's bad for business to consistently keep making an ass of yourselves in front of the more civilized world.  Both will fuck you in the ass though, and are thankful for your votes and the tax money you keep sending to them and the corporations (i.e. shareholders) they represent, and this is because you think politics is red versus blue (false dichotomy fallacy BTW), and because the USA is not a democracy for a number of reasons (including but not limiting to lack of referendums, indirect election, non-legally-binding political programmes and lobbying).",™

t5_2qh6c,cabbagery,1382454945,"Let's try a new tact. As near as I can tell, your view (and Barron's) is that much of the OT did not actually happen -- it was either significantly exaggerated or largely invented. I take it that as such you accept the narrative not as a sequence of actual events, but as a story from which we can (and should) glean important personal insight into the nature of god and our role in the world (specifically, in the struggle against evil).  That's all well and good. In fact, that's probably the only way one *can* take the OT and retain something like moral consistency; it seems abundantly clear that practicing chattel slavery (even when endorsed by god) and engaging in genocide (even when commanded by god) are moral evils. Given that perspective, one *must* view the depictions of these events as metaphorical.  The problem arises from the fact that nobody does this -- takes a metaphorical approach to the OT -- in a consistent fashion. It's all *ad hoc*. The divine endorsement of chattel slavery can be found as early as the page following the dictation of the Ten Commandments; it is part of the same sequence of events, and among the rules set forth by Yahweh on Sinai to Moses. If you accept the provision of two (four, if you count the second set) stone tablets and ten rules there written as dictated directly by Yahweh, you have some very interesting gymnastics to perform in order to deny the veracity of the very next pages. The Ten Commandments appear in Exodus 20. The endorsement of slavery -- of *beating* one's slaves with impunity -- appears in Exodus 21...  ...and it's not like chapter and verse divisions were provided with the original.  So if you say the latter is purely metaphorical and not really part of the Law as Yahweh intended, I can't wait to hear how you might rescue the former in a way which is consistent in its exclusion of the latter.  It's not good enough to point to it and say, ""See? It's just a metaphor. The Hebrews didn't *actually* own slaves or commit genocide."" It's not good enough because  1. It was believed -- is presently believed by most Christians -- that it actually took place. Even *Jesus* appeared to treat the OT as a factual account of the history of Israel and Yahweh's involvement with them.  2. If Yahweh in fact oversaw the development of the bible -- the selection of the canon, the inclusion of the stories therein, etc. -- then evidently Yahweh *wanted* those to be included, with all of the baggage they brought. That seems irresponsible and short-sighted for an ostensibly omnipotent and omniscient deity. If I wanted a record of my actions to remain long after I stopped being obviously involved in the world, and I wanted that record to accurately reflect my actions, and I had the power to ensure that would be the case, I'd sure as hell *do* so. That Yahweh does not do so counts against either his concern for the contents (caprice) or his abilities to prevent a bad biography (incompetence or weakness).  Now, to your specific points.  &gt; If I summarized Shakespeare's *The Merchant of Venice* in such a trivial way, it is in no way comparable to reading it in full context and presentation of what it is.  *The Merchant of Venice* is a historical work of fiction with no clear moral. It is venerated for its age and success as a dramatic work, not for its insight into how we should act. It is an entertainment piece. I'm perfectly happy treating the bible in precisely the same manner -- it is a remarkable work of quasi-historical fiction, with no clear moral (hence this very discussion), and it is both entertaining and fascinating in its own right -- and it should be studied as historical literature.  I'm going to change the Shakespeare play under discussion now to *Hamlet*, because it's a better example for my present purposes. Hamlet exhibits immoral behavior. The play could be construed to have a clear moral (though this would invariably be controversial), and yet we regard the work highly in exactly the same ways as *The Merchant of Venice*. Yet we also have no problem reinterpreting *Hamlet*, or using it as inspiration for more modern depictions. Have you seen the movie *Strange Brew* (if not, you *should* -- it's a classic)? It is in fact a retelling of *Hamlet*, from the perspectives of drunken buffoons Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. (Indeed, the movie could scarcely be more obvious, as the brewery is the 'Elsinore' brewery, the evil uncle is named 'Claude,' etc.) Yet to do something with the bible as Moranis and Thomas did with *Hamlet* would undoubtedly be cast as sacrilege and denounced much in the way *The Last Temptation of Christ* was denounced by Christianity in the late 80s.  You cannot say that the bible or OT are parallels of venerated works of fiction, because the bible and OT are not treated as works of fiction. I'm tempted to use *ipso facto* on you again, but that lesson has run its course.  &gt; Aside from your own aesthetic objections, I don't see why [god should not have used problematic legendary accounts].  The accounts in question were the very catalyst for the Barron's video and for this discussion, and they were so specifically because of their problematic nature. QED.  &gt; While I would agree with you that the slavery and genocide (if put in a literal context) would be intrinsically immoral. . .  So you accept moral absolutism at least with respect to these acts...  &gt; . . . when understanding the non-application of such repercussions and restrictions [their inclusion in the OT] would be understandable in relation to the time and location of the culture in question. . .  ...but this is cultural relativism...  &gt; . . . with the outcome taken in such decisions.  ...and you don't even think it happened, evidently.  Let's put this another way: if you accept that genocide and slavery are absolutely morally impermissible, why would god accept them as metaphors if they would not be *recognized* as metaphors? If they are absolutely morally impermissible, a morally perfect agent could neither command nor endorse them and retain moral perfection; if they are included in an account in such a way that they are taken to be factual accounts, they threaten the perception of that agent's moral perfection. As I have said, if slavery and genocide were not included, *we couldn't have this discussion*, and yes, I daresay you'd insist the Hebrews did not engage in either -- I have evidence of this, in fact, because you're effectively saying that *now*.  This is a take on the argument from divine incompetence or ambiguity -- god could have easily ensured that the bible would be clear and unambiguous, and given omnipotence, god could in fact have magicked things such that the text itself changed over the years in ways that corresponded to the understanding of the cultures who studied it. Indeed, it could have been (I suppose could *still be*) the case that every person who reads the bible sees different words and gains different-yet-accurate insight (never mind this is rapidly approaching something like solipsism). Yet we have ample examples of disagreement with respect to interpretation and understanding, so even if we *do* read different words or gain different insight, it is clearly not the case that we all have access to the True Message®.  Yet if god would have provided clear instruction and guidance rather than apparently endorsing or commanding immoral behavior, we'd not only be unable to have this very conversation, but quite possibly we'd be in a much better world. So what if the bronze-age Hebrews were too stupid or defiant to follow the rules? They didn't follow the weird-ass rules they *were* given. Hell, a week after being magickally rescued from the Egyptians, they melted down all of their gold to make a freaking cow statue to worship!  Don't tell them to commit genocide, and don't let them say you told them to commit genocide. Tell them to abolish slavery, and *make them include that*. If you want an apt metaphor for battling evil, try battling the evil which is *inside of each of us* -- inside of the nation of Israel at the time. I see disease again as a perfect metaphor, and I see a squandered opportunity in every five-word phrase in the bible which isn't, ""The LORD says: Abolish slavery.""  Whatever else you might say about genocide and slavery, you sure as hell can't say we came to recognize these as the evils they are because of the bible or its teaching. We came to recognize these as evil *in spite of the bible*.  &gt; No, I hold that Morality exists objectively in the nature of God.  There are lots of nuanced views regarding the interplay between an objective moral standard (moral objectivism) and a god. None of them is DCT. DCT *just is* moral subjectivism. Take a course on ethical theory. (I still don't think you affirm DCT, as evidenced by your sentiments as well as your apparent misunderstanding of its implications. Try some of the nuanced views which affirm moral objectivism -- some of them are quite good.)  &gt; The Job comparison is not apt considering that the reciprocation, as you depict it, is supposed to make everything up. If the story had depicted an unjust man being allowed to commit immoral activity in that he would eventually bring about a greater good, you would have your point.  Job was relevant because it has a happy ending, which is apparently enough for you to endorse the entire story. That story *does* depict ""an unjust [agent] being allowed to commit immoral activity"" which ostensibly brings about ""a greater good."" That agent is, of course, Yahweh. This is a red herring, however; my point was that happy endings do not good moral guides make.  &gt; Disease has been used by the Church as an example for the working regeneration of Grace, which is a passive act. War and battle are actions of active resistance, as is our battle with evil.  Battling disease is an active process, and you, the church, and certainly god should know it.",®

t5_2qh4i,Mephiz,1382458316,"continued ...   Tiffany noticed the same thing most critics did about David's newest volume: ''He seems to be more soul-searching, more sensitive,"" she concedes. The book is the first of his to acknowledge, if indirectly, the muddiness of bringing shared lives into the spotlight. And the first that Tiffany has allowed David to put her in.  ''David has his own version of the truth, and it bumps into my version. His makes mine not true, and mine makes his not true,"" Tiffany says matter-of-factly. ''He said he wrote about our pain because we weren't doing anything with it. When I die, you can recycle me. Till then, it's mine.""  Tonight, like most nights, Tiffany will recycle. She'll fill the red cart she fashioned herself with bits of other people's lives. She'll take those pieces home, pull out her tile cutters, and break discarded pasts into small pieces. Splinters will fall to her feet; she might step on them later. She'll find the right mosaic for these colors and shapes and press them in. She'll color the grout that holds them together with coffee, chalk, mustard -- whatever she's found nights before. She doesn't leave a piece until it feels finished, which can take a few months, when the trash is good, or several years of looking for just the right shade of rose.  She prices her pieces on a sliding scale. ''It depends on how much I had to hurt myself while I made it, how far I had to drag it, whether it was night or day. Mostly, I make it up,"" she says. ''It's a made-up price for made-up stuff in a made-up world.""  Her finished work hangs in her window, which she likes, or at art shows, which she hates. ''People want some extra bit of you and ask why you made it, or what it means, or what it's supposed to be."" She shakes her head. ''There it is. That's all I have to say.""  Tiffany is a storyteller, like her brother, looking for a way to share a collected past and make it mean something new. Gardens of glass hang in her window -- big red roses and leafy trees and a deep orange sun. Sunlight rouses magic in the glass, and the mosaics transform. At 6 o'clock, when the light is best, they're sparkling, spellbinding worlds. At 6 o'clock, Tiffany's stories are always true.   © Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company.",©

t5_2qh9z,MLeviDDS,1382467134," Four Ways to Improve Your Smile      by MinaLeviDDS on 2013/10/08 9:41 AM      Improvements in dental techniques and new cosmetic products and procedures give you many options for improvement if you are unhappy with the appearance of your smile. Depending upon your goals, your oral health, and your budget, you can opt for cosmetic dentistry, veneers, Invisalign® alignment devices, or even an instant ""Snap on Smile.""     Cosmetic Dentistry  Cosmetic dentistry is concerned with the aesthetics of your smile, not just your oral health. Cosmetic dentists use state-of-the-art tools, materials, and techniques to realize your vision of a beautiful smile. Often, Cosmetic Dentistry includes removal or movement of teeth to improve the symmetry of a patient’s smile, but some dental problems that detract from a smile’s appearance are easier to fix. You may opt for custom whitening with an oxidizing agent, laser-reshaping of gum tissue, or correction of broken or chipped teeth with epoxies or veneers.     Veneers  Dental Veneers are thin coverings of ceramic or porcelain – or sometimes a composite resin. This covering is permanently bonded to the fronts of patients’ teeth, and can be used on one or two, or the entire visible smile. Fitting and adhering Veneers does not usually require anesthesia, and is ideal for those who want to improve the look of their most visible front teeth but do not require movement or removal of teeth. You can hide stains, fill gaps between teeth, create a brighter smile, and make slight changes to the shape of teeth with Veneers. Results can last for many years.     Snap on Smile  Snap-On-Smile is a great option for patients who are not sure they want to commit to more permanent or expensive improvements to their smiles. Some patients use Snap on Smile temporarily, to mask damaged teeth until a permanent fix can be achieved. These thin, strong, custom-fitted coverings for the visible teeth provides better bite function as well as a more pleasing appearance, and can be created and fitted without anesthesia or any change in tooth structure. They are available for upper and lower teeth.     Invisalign  Invisalign® tooth aligners are clear, comfortable nearly invisible customized devices that work similarly to regular braces, without the pain, mouth sores, tooth decay or discoloration, plaque buildup, and difficulty eating that regular braces often cause. Invisalign® helps to gradually move a patient’s teeth into the proper alignment, creating a symmetrical smile and helping the gums fit more securely around the teeth to help prevent gum disease.  Topics: Veneers, Invisalign, Cosmetic Dentistry, Snap on Smile     ",®

t5_2qh87,Kichigai,1382471587,"&gt; You are assuming that they are using uncompressed video … and I doubt is the case  Well, internally they're rendering to uncompressed frames which then may be compressed, but not knowing enough about the type of compression I didn't want to begin to make guesses about something I couldn't back up with facts and figures.  And as I've mentioned elsewhere, I wasn't so much talking about this from the standpoint of the amount of data they're storing losslessly, but rather to give an idea as to just how much data in in an 8,000x8,000 frame to illustrate why a machine doing work at that resolution in Cinema 4D would need at least 96GB of RAM and 12+ cores, relative to an After Effects machine working at 1080p.  &gt; …uncompressed video, which takes a shitload of space at any resolution  Well, 8,000x8,000 demands exorbitant amounts of storage, but uncompressed video at other resolutions are reasonable.  Take, for example, 1920x1080. Uncompresed SDI frames (which are standard) run about 3Gb/s. That's pretty reasonable. That's roughly [1.2TiB/hr](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3GbPS*1hour). It's not a format most people would work at (typically I see DNxHD 175 X, 440 X, or ProRes 422 HQ), but you could make that work.  At [Standard Definition, we're talking around 360Mb/s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_259M), which is *quite* reasonable. DNxHD 440 X tops out at, well, 440Mb/s, and [ProRes 4444 gets up to 330Mb/s at 1080p](http://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/index.html#chapter=10%26section=4), and these are formats you see in The Real World™.  &gt; you also assume that each workstation is working with 8K, but each projector only broadcasts 4K by 2K, so I would guess that the workstations are only dealing with that.  Not when they're doing all their composing. When setting up the scene I'd put good money that it's set up and visualized at 8,000x8,000 in C4D, and rendered out as an 8,000x8,000 ""flat"" file. From there, when fed to the projection system I wouldn't be surprised if it was pre-processed into several 4k-by-2k streams to be fed into the projector, but there's no way that they're assembling the whole thing from six different C4D comps. That would be a major pain in the ass to stitch together for presentation. Far too many opportunities to end up too close to show time and say ""damn, I f'd up that seam there and everything is off and overlapping/not lining up!"" It's far more reasonable to make one big total picture and then do an automated slicing system.  Now, I'm not saying it's out of the realm of possibility that there's some sort of script that when it's time to render out the final version the sequence at full res, that it's then fed through a script that divides up the comp into several sub-comps at 4k-by-2k and *those* are farmed out to the render cluster, but then that's an even *bigger* render job because you've got all the bits of the scene that overlap each other that are being rendered multiple times.  Besides, in reality since they're doing full-res renders on a cluster the amount of RAM and processing power used by that *far* exceeds 16 cores and 96GB of RAM in the end.",™

t5_2ss1q,large-farva,1382475646,"hmm... this review seems to sum it up well:  &gt;That has to be a deal! The question is how does Emerilware compare to the prestigious ""All-Clad?"" I own both, so here's what I know.  PRICE: An All-Clad Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set sells at Williams Sonoma for $799.95 (list price is $1,225.00). The similar set of Emerilware sells on Amazon for $200!  CONSTRUCTION: Both Emerilware and All-Clad have the patented tri-ply construction with an aluminum core to deliver even heat distribution and are made from 18/10 stainless steel. The handles are similar, attached with two heavy rivets. All-Clad has metal lids, while Emerilware has glass lids. Both are oven-safe up to 500 degrees, but the glass lids are only oven-safe to 350 degrees.  The Emerilware design has one difference from the All-Clad. The sides are thinner and the pan is welded to a ""heat diffuser disc"" on the bottom to promote even cooking. The All-Clad pan is one-piece construction (except for the handle) and even thickness overall.  When I first held the Emerilware 10-inch saute pan, I thought that it had to be lighter than the similar All-Clad version. Upon weighing both, to my amazement I found only three grams difference! The extra weight in the Emerilware must be from the welded bottom, since the sides are noticeably thinner that those of the All-Clad pan.  ORIGIN: All-Clad Metalcrafters in Canonsburg, PA manufactures both the ""All-Clad Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel Cookware"" and ""Emeril Pro-Clad Cookware."" However, All-Clad is made in Pennsylvania and Emerilware is made in China. The price reflects this difference.  PERFORMANCE: How does Emerilware differ in performance? In theory, the All-Clad with the thicker sides should distribute and hold heat better than the Emerilware. Actually, I don't see enough difference to justify the enormous price disparity. Both can get stains and burned on food, but both come clean in minutes using Bar Keepers Friend® Cleanser &amp; Polish: 12 OZ.  The bottom line is that Emerilware Pro-Clad is not All-Clad, but you're not paying for All-Clad. Emerilware looks like a bargain, to me.",®

Once these revolutionary parties seize power they set themselves up as sole arbiter of what is and isn't properly communist rather than establishing frameworks where *workers* are given the freedom to establish and debate democratically without fear of being called counterrevolutionary and being sacked.   Vanguard parties see themselves as responsible for keeping everyone on the True and Right™ path, so when disagreements about policy eventually arise it becomes nearly impossible for people to engage in a discussion about it without the party having an overwhelming and disproportionate say in the matter. They call this democracy of the people, but its a mirror image of the same bourgeoisie power structures they claim to hate.  Movements end up being little more than a collection of oligarchs presiding over a top heavy bureaucracy. Party functionaries expect the world to work in a perfectly mechanistic fashion, guided by a set of rules that exist above and beyond society. They ignore the fact that nobody exists outside of society and we can't engineer an inherently flawed and human system in the same way we can static and lifeless objects.

t5_2sfmf,Shoden,1382480686,"&gt; In the private sector, I'm not sure. In the public sector, taking bribes.  Do you believe the private sector is immune to bribes?  &gt; I'm sorry you have no cogent rebuttals to it, but it's the truth.  Again your weird narrow definition of corruption is silly. Governments can seek profit, they just can't do it at the cost of the public good. Business can seek profit, and without laws are not subject to the public good. **How they seek that profit is how they can be corrupted"". Doing things like dumping chemical waste, false advertising, so on and so forth.   You keep stating things as if they are facts, you really don't know how to argue your point very well. Just because you repeat something does not make it true. Your argument that the government is vastly more corrupt than business is based solely on your own assumptions. It is in no way convincing.  &gt; Seriously?!? Let me provide an example. Corruption doesn't pay off in the private sector.  You again here are still trying to pretend like people act rationally in all cases. Many ""utopian"" ideas would work super if people weren't irrational.  &gt; In the public sector,   Again, your argument here is for better enforcement of laws, and getting money out of politics. It is not an argument against government, it is an argument against a bad aspect of this current government.   &gt; I'd argue that laws and enforcement, due to corrupt public officials, can be (and often are) selectively enforced  Well ya, like i keep saying, everything is corruptible.  &gt; Laws and enforcement are almost always politically applied, rather than out of interest for fairness.   Again you are saying things as if they are fact when they are just your subjective view.  &gt; Natural monopolies, on the other hand, don't exist.  Nor does your ""free market"". You have heard of salt right? That was a natural monopoly historically. Those that controlled the mines controlled the flow of salt at times. You seem to think only about large corporate monopolies, what about price gouging, local monopolies.  &gt; I'm unable to trade goods and services without laws and contracts? That's news to me.  In your world credit can't exist then, everything has to be 1 to 1 barter. As soon as anything more complicated than that happens, you enter into contracts, which need to be enforced by something. If no enforcement, how does you magical society function?  &gt; Monopolies don't exist without a government because they would constantly be under the threat of competition.   And if one company buys up all the water in a region? What then?  &gt; 100% market share monopolies have not historically existed without government support.  Because business have not existed without governments of some sort.  &gt; If that's the case, then you should be able to point to an example of one such monopoly, as I requested earlier.  &gt; Corruption hurts a business' very means to survive.  Only your narrow definition of corruption does. Exposed corruption hurts government means to survive, since it depends on public support. Your whole point here is simplistic. You dumb things down to points you think help your case, while ignoring the nuances that exist in other the public and private sector.   &gt;  Businesses can fire corrupt employees, shareholders can discharge corrupt executives, etc. The same is not true of corrupt public figures.  Criminal/corrupt officials can be arrested , different branches provide checks and balances, and Politicians can be voted out. You don't believe these things work any more than I believe your examples make businesses any less prone to corruptions. But again, you and I have different views of corruption.  &gt; Explain how one could both be rich while simultaneously holding no power.   Define power.  &gt; You are aware of what makes a rich person a rich person, right?  Money I presume.  &gt; Well, the Anarchists™ wouldn't describe it as anarchy, but given your context, yes, I do believe that a stateless society would be the best thing for everyone.  I figured that part out. But your stateless society doesn't work in reality.  &gt; I'm not saying the rich person is a more important human than the minimum wage earner  Yes you are.  &gt; but I am saying that financial impacts to them are more important than financial impacts to the single minimum wage earner.  You are saying their financial impacts hit more people, but not admitting those people also have the power to vote. So if I work in the lumber industry as a mailguy, i know that laws regulating my industry could affect my job, so I vote accordingly.  &gt; As far as the rest of it goes, uh, why do you own a house on a minimum wage job?  Read again, i said ""home"". Be it apartment, or what not.   &gt; We built waaaaaay too many houses for demand that appeared to be there, but wasn't (thanks, government!).  Oh ya it wasn't that whole misleading mortgage deals or anything, the 2007 crash was all the government.   Your posts all carefully avoid the big questions with your stateless society. What stops warlords, people with weapons, and violence in general? How small is small enough, and how large can businesses grow? Who enforces contracts, who enforces property rights?   Your fantasy is based on the idea that all people are rational, which is a delusion. And you still never defined corruption, unless you honestly only believe stealing from your business is the only corruption.",™

The mods have just Banned me from /r/News on my main account for helping support a rape victim, I am going to state my case and plea now to the rest of Reddit and tell them what this mod has done, this is SICK. If the mods wanted his picture taken down, (the one that's all over the media) I added in my post to ask me if they wanted the picture removed before doing anything rash. Instead this mod acted power-hungry and banned me without giving a name as to who did it, a reason, or anything else. What happened to asking someone nicely to follow your orders around here? last time I checked this wasn't the Marines, and to outright BAN me? not just delete my posts, give me a reason and ask me to take the picture down, but a total ban from /r/News.   http://i.imgur.com/ObZnyDv.png  That should tell you the whole story as they were most likely hoping my voice wouldn't be heard or that I would just give up to prevent any backlash that may ensue against the mystery mod had I of been angry and decide to talk about it.   **|↨↨|** I-SUPP**♥**RT-Daisy  I'm not sure if you saw that ^ in my other posts or read the reasoning behind it, but I came up with it not only Daisy but it signified a bond in this community with the upvote and downvote arrows coming together and the bold | | barriers to bond and unite us. I wanted the **|↨↨|** used before anything we ever supported on Reddit from now on so we would finally have something of our own and I named it the Lashtag in memory of Daisy, much like a Twitter Hashtag but the Lash representing Daisy as in Eyelashes, as they looked very distinguished in the picture they're showing in the media.  Now I'm thinking of designing the same one, but one arrow will have a crack in it, and I will fly it in every post I ever have and it will represent the mod that banned me from helping Daisy and keeping my/our voice from being heard and coming together in support.   This isn't about the Scumbag that did this to her like the mods seem to think, this is about supporting someone that had their whole life ruined and coming together to show support for her in the Reddit community. Yet the mods discounted all of that and focused on a single picture they could have asked me to take down, instead they are trying to get rid of the whole post that showed what the Lashtag was all about and how we can unite as a community to help a rape victim and support future causes.  I will still fly this and I hope the rest of Reddit does to.   **|↨↨|** I-SUPP**♥**RT-DAISY",♥

t5_2qi6d,rfelsburg,1382488077,"From what I've read on Battery Tender's site I don't believe that's the case. The float stage specifically guards against that.  ""After connecting the BT Plus to a battery and then applying AC power, it first conducts a number of checks during Initialization Mode to ensure that the battery functioning normally. Then it will deliver its full charge at a constant rate of 1.25 amperes. This is called the Bulk Charge Mode. The battery voltage will rise and when it reaches a predetermined level the BT Plus will hold the battery charge voltage constant at that level, allowing the charge current amplitude to drop. This is the Absorption Charge Mode. The Absorption Charge Mode is complete when the battery charge current drops below a very low value, usually below ¼ ampere. Some BT Plus models have timers to limit the duration of the Absorption Charge Mode.  After the current drops or the allotted time expires (typically several hours), the BT Plus automatically switches to a Float / Maintenance Charge Mode. The purpose of the Float / Maintenance Charge Mode is to maintain the battery voltage just slightly (typically between 1/10 and ½ volt) above where it would be if it were fully charged and sitting at rest. This keeps the battery topped off at voltages well below the gassing voltage of a lead acid battery.  Based on price alone, trickle chargers often appear to be a better economic choice for the typical consumer, but trickle chargers do not have the advantage of sophisticated electronic control. Therefore, as they allow the value of charge current to trickle down to what appears to be safe levels, the output voltage of the charger may very well rise to an unacceptably high level, sometimes even going higher than 16 VDC depending on the charger type and the battery that is connected to it. This magnitude of voltage is far above the gassing voltage of a lead acid battery. If the battery remains connected to this high level of voltage for an extended period of time, extreme damage may be done to the battery. Without Battery Tender® type electronic safety controls, what appears to be an initial cost savings for the charger may actually cost several times the charger price in replacement batteries.""",®

t5_2qh1e,twistedcain,1382497528,"I think what bothers me about GoPro^TM advertisements being on the front page of reddit all the time, isn't the obvious advertising or the fake upvotes and comments, what bothers me is that there is nothing innovative or unique about their cameras. There are plenty of other manufacturers making the exact same thing and many times for much less money. It's a small camera you attach to yourself, it's not the rebirth of science as we know it.  I'm not going to buy the World's Most Versatile Camera®, GoPro^TM, so about the only thing this accomplishes is creating advertiser blindness. Which soon enough will just make me not bother to come to reddit anymore. Maybe the new masses of people on here are still naive enough to not understand this is all paid advertising for reddit, and that's fine, maybe it's time for some of us to simply move on.  And no, I'm not against companies creating unique or innovative products being discussed on reddit, I'm all for it. Google self driving cars and IBM's Watson detecting cancer, even if these were ads, at least they are promoting something simply amazing.

I live in NYC, it might be a rare thing elsewhere.   sugaring dates back to the civilizations of mesopotamia, egypt, and greece. it is a form of hair removal that resembles waxing, but is actually much gentler and less painful to endure and requires a higher level of technical skill to perform. Shobha® sugaring treatments are available for all areas of the body, sans the face. sweet facts about sugaring:  secret family recipe - the unique sugaring gel is all-natural, consisting of only sugar, lemon juice, glycerin &amp; water. it looks like honey! (natural ingredients mean natural reactions, which for most is no reaction at all!) sensitivity &amp; pain - sugaring gel can be used on even the most sensitive skin; many find it to be noticeably less painful than waxing. oh! how sweet it is - since sugaring gel adheres to your hair &amp; sticks to your skin, you can achieve optimal results, with minimal irritation, while still removing the hair from the root. now, many waxers are converting to sugaring.

t5_2skou,YouSuffer,1382504412,"I went and looked this up on Ubisoft's [faq](http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-us/faq/): &gt; Will I be able to use DLC from the original Rocksmith  with Rocksmith 2014 Edition?  &gt;Yes, you will. Your previous DLC purchases will be transferable without any sort of re-payment, **as long as you’re moving them on the same platform** (i.e., trying to move your original Rocksmith DLC you got on your Xbox 360 console to a copy of Rocksmith 2014 Edition on PlayStation®3 system will not work).  That's for DLC.  It doesn't say this about on-disc songs.  However, the Steam store page says:  &gt; Buy Rocksmith 2014 Disc Import Tool  &gt; Requires Ownership of Rocksmith on Steam in order to use the Disc Import Tool.  So even though I would have expected the answer to be ""of course you can"" it seems that no, you can't switch platforms and get your old content.  I keep going back and forth on this.  I got excited by the idea of messing around with my interface, but if it doesn't make much difference and all I want to do is play Rocksmith it's probably better to get it for the living room.  I'll get to use the new features with the old songs that way, too.  I also read a few complaints about the game's mouse support.  Apparently keyboard is still the way to go.  But then I remember that the crackling of the ""Real Tone"" cable is annoying (though not game-breaking, most noticeable in amp mode) and wonder if I could get around that with the PC version...",®

t5_2tjsd,notFanatiq,1382514628,"I will definitely agree with what others here have said. Removing Triforce from the FGC would be a serious improvement. The embodiment of everything that is wrong with the East Coast, Triforce is a shady, self-serving con artist who has the nerve to call himself a ""businessman."" Let me pose a question: who are the 5 best Marvel players in the FGC right now? AGE Fanatiq, AGE Knives, AGE Chris G, AGE Flash Metroid, and AGE Fanatiq. If Triforce is such an important figure and savvy businessman, how come he doesn't have a single one of the 5 best Marvel players sponsored on his team? I'll tell you why: because that nigga is a joke. No one outside of New York city has *any* respect for Triforce, and most of the people *in* New York only *pretend* to respect that nigga because they feel sorry for him. If ""only a sucker works a 9 to 5,"" then that nigga is working double shifts, AM and PM, 7 days a week with no vacation.  Triforce does nothing for the community. Compare what he does to what some of the most influential and talented top players in the FGC, players like AGE Fanatiq for instance, do on a regular basis. Not only does AGE Fanatiq consistently produce gaming-and-entertainment-related content for his stream family all the time on **www.twitch.tv/mrfanatiq**, but he also uses his influential business sense to generously provide discount offers for players looking to support the community and increase their swag level by purchasing merchandise from [**Performance Designed Products®**](http://www.pdp.com/) using the promo code ""AGEFANATIQ."" Triforce not only has no influence with successful corporate enterprises, but even if he did would surely not use them to give back to the community. A black mark on everything that is good about the FGC, the community would be much better as a whole if the cancer that is Triforce went into remission.",®

t5_2qh30,Gro-Tsen,1382547864,"I agree with your observations but I think the conclusion to draw from them is that ""JavaScript uses UTF-16 rather than UCS-4 (with the footnote that it confusingly calls 'characters' what are actually UTF-16 code units)"", not ""JavaScript uses UCS-2 rather than UTF-16"".  If JavaScript really used UCS-2, then the value of ""👽"".length would be 1 because ""👽"" would be remapped as U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER since the character is not representable in UCS-2.  Also, if JavaScript used UCS-2, then (as you yourself point out), one could not include surrogates in strings because they are not Unicode characters and can never be part of a UCS-2-encoded character string (they are, by essence, part of UTF-16).  It is possible that there are some browsers that behave like this, and they would conform to the standard (albeit stupidly).  If JavaScript used UCS-4, then of course everything would be fine: every Unicode character would be represented by a single code unit.  The same would be true, of course, if JavaScript used UTF-16 transparently (or UTF-8 transparently), i.e., by exposing only Unicode code points and not code units — but then the question of what JavaScript actually uses would become essentially meaningless.  Instead, JavaScript, like Java, exposes 16-bit code units and presents a single astral Unicode code point as two surrogate code units: I think the best way of describing this situation is to say that it presents character strings as UTF-16 encoded strings and confusingly describes UTF-16 code units as ""characters"".",👽

I don't have a sophisticated ear so they sound just fine to me, also I am playing a low end fender acoustic.  From their site:  &gt;The difference between our coating ""flavors"" lies in the tone and feel. Elixir® Strings with NANOWEB Coating sound and feel more like traditional, uncoated strings. They are bright and lively, and the coating is so thin that you can barely tell it's there. Elixir® Strings with POLYWEB Coating have a balanced tone. They sound like strings that have been perfectly ""played in"". They are comfortably smooth and help reduce finger squeak.

t5_2r187,GrandmaGos,1382565887,"Use Mod Podge® straight-up, not white glue and water, which will make the ink run and will make the paper wrinkle up horribly. It comes in a choice of matte, gloss, and satin finishes. It is white glue with a proprietary ingredient added that makes it set up with a distinctive depth and texture that simply using white glue does not give.  You're not going to be using laminate or laminating something--this is decoupage, which is quite different.    You swab on a layer of Mod Podge, then you place the pieces of paper where you want it, and then you swab an additional coat of Mod Podge all over the paper, making sure that the paper absorbs it.  This will take about 30 days to cure completely. After that, if you want, you can put an additional top coat of clear acrylic sealant (Minwax) over it, to help protect it further, as your decoupage is going to be on an object that will be handled.  &gt;I think my best bet is to use iron-on laminant.   This is unnecessary; Mod Podge alone provides a fairly durable top coat, it's widely used to decoupage coffee tables, benches, and things like that. And as I said, you can add an acrylic topcoat.

Shouldn't feminists welcome the support whether or not you choose to call yourself a Feminist™ ?  The only answer I've come up with is that most feminists (or at least the feminists that have criticized me) are not gender-egalitarians as they claim, because if they were they wouldn't feel the need to criticize my choice of not identifying as a feminist.  If anybody has some insight as to why they might not agree with my use of egalitarian over feminism, I'd like to hear it.  I want to believe that most feminists are actually gender-egalitarians.",™

t5_2qh1f,codergamergeekyguy,1382569687,"GMail doesn't have *folders* per se. It uses tags to categorize email messages. The difference being is that typically if a message is in folder X it is consequently *not* in folder Y. Whereas with tags, a message can have as many tags as you want: X, Y, Z, ☃, whatever.  The way that the Inbox and Archive ""folders"" works in GMail is that all messages are given the ""Inbox"" tag when they are first delivered. Archiving a message just deletes the Inbox tag. You can think of Archive as ""All Mail"" because all mail, regardless of what tags it has shows up in Archive (even Inbox).  So yes, using GMail, it *is* normal for a message to appear in both Inbox and ""Specific Folder Name"" at the same time … because they're tags, not folders. So if a given message has both the Inbox tag and ""Specific Folder Name"" tag, then it will show up in both places.",☃

The book lets the reader assume the role of a brilliant, Hardy Boy looking kid detective in 1963 Dallas. As with Encyclopedia Brown, he's the son of an incompetent Chief of Police (in this case, an unnamed Jesse Curry) and is constantly helping his father solve even the most obvious of crimes. But when JFK dies right in the heart of downtown Dallas, well, complications ensue.  The link above isn't to a purchase page, it's to a detailed, behind-the-scenes look at all the CYOA callbacks and historical facts that helped inform the characters and plots of the book. If you liked CYOA books, Kid Detective fiction, or conspiracy lore, we think you'll find it pretty funny and rich. We hope so, anyway!

Your previous DLC purchases will be transferable without any sort of re-payment, as long as you’re moving them on the same platform (i.e., trying to move your original Rocksmith DLC you got on your Xbox 360 console to a copy of Rocksmith 2014 Edition on PlayStation®3 system will not work). This means that Rocksmith 2014 Edition will see new DLC releases in addition to the vast library already established with the original Rocksmith.  **What about the on-disc songs from the original Rocksmith? Can I play those?**  Yes! If you still own the original Rocksmith, you will be able to import 52 of the original songs into the new Rocksmith 2014 Edition for a one-time music label relicensing fee of $9.99. As part of this process, all these songs will be updated with the new tunings, techniques, tones, and other enhancements new to 2014 Edition. These 52 songs include everything except Eric Clapton ""Run Back To Your Side"" and Cream ""Sunshine of Your Love"" from the main disc tracks, plus 3 of the 5 unlockable bonus songs.

When the leaves have fallen off, they dip the cut end into water then RooTone® and pot them up into 1 gallon containers. The potted cuttings are watered in well then stored for the winter. No more water is given until spring. When spring arrives, the cuttings have rooted and are well on their way much sooner than cuttings taken even in very early spring.*  In your case I would only add that you should trim both damaged ends square.

Jastreboff  Department of Internal Medicine (Endocrinology) and Pediatrics (Pediatric Endocrinology), School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. E-mail: ania.jastreboff@yale.edu Can the same hormone that helps you bond with people help you lose weight? Historically, oxytocin has been recognized for its role in lactation, parturition, and, more recently, social bonding, but this neuropeptide may also affect eating behavior. Animal studies of rodents with diet-induced obesity have shown that chronic administration of oxytocin diminishes food intake, resulting in weight loss. In a study published this month, Ott et al. examine the effect of oxytocin on eating behavior in humans.  In a double-blind, cross-over, within-subject study, 20 healthy lean [mean body mass index (BMI) 22.7 kg/m2], young (mean age 26.3) men received intranasal oxytocin versus placebo on 2 separate days. After administration of one of the two intranasal substances, on each testing day the men were presented with a breakfast buffet (hungry condition) followed by an array of sweet, salty, and bland snacks (satiated condition). In the hungry condition (breakfast buffet), men ate the same amount regardless of oxytocin or placebo administration. Interestingly, after administration of oxytocin, men ate fewer snacks; specifically, their consumption of chocolate cookies decreased by 25%. Additionally, oxytocin administration decreased adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and peak glucose response after breakfast, whereas it did not affect insulin levels, subjective hunger, olfaction, or energy expenditure (assessed by indirect calorimetry). The authors suggest that oxytocin diminished reward-based eating but did not influence hunger-based eating; furthermore, it affected hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and, perhaps, postprandial glucoregulation.  This study provides evidence in humans that oxytocin may play a role not only in our intimate relationships with people but also in our relationship with food—specifically, reward-based eating. Concurrently, a recent pilot study in China found that 8 weeks of intranasal oxytocin reduced weight in nine obese individuals. Certainly, studies must be conducted in a larger sample of subjects, including women and obese individuals, with administration over a longer period of time to investigate whether intranasal oxytocin is indeed a potential pharmacologic agent for the treatment of obesity. In the meantime, perhaps increasing our oxytocin levels with a hug may help us skip dessert.  V. Ott et al., Oxytocin reduces reward-driven food intake in humans. Diabetes 62, 3418–3425 (2013).

After years of political maneuvering and a well placed war, the International Organization for Migration finally launched it's plan to divert funds from a hospital for the most devious plot of our generation: to build an inner-city YMCA pool hall for Afghani youth.  The plot thickens now that the paper trail has been discovered, and the only way to save the boys' safe-haven from drugs and terrorism is for a mild-mannered but outspoken Afghani lawyer serving 100 hours of community service to launch a fundraiser of epic proportions.

There.is.NOTHING.on.topic.she.brings.to.the.table.    Giving her an outlets is LITERALLY to spread misinformation and dat vitriol.  Its like letting a pedophile come to your school to explain to kids how enjoyable having a MUCH older partner is.  It's COMPLETELY (dare I say) stupid to provide such an outlet to such insanity.    Edit: I mean look at her twitter post about reddit. https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/392321834923741184    Thats the same excuse she gives to radio stations/tv channels/etc when she knows her publicity manager is forcing her to do these wastes of time. Im not a liberal at any means, but it's common knowledge that any political ""opinion"" she has is way off base and promotes the misdirection of converssation vs the discussion of ideas.    Please understand this.",®

t5_2qh1i,aliveandwellthanks,1382623629," This is what I turn to when think of this question :   Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927  ",©

NVidia 7600, ATI X1600 or better     * Hard Drive: At least 2.5 GB of free space     * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card  So you might look at the 700 dollar one if you want to save your self some cash. The dual SLI video card setup would be nice for some of the other games out there though if you want this to be something of a high end Steam Box :)",®

I also couldn't see anything obvious about Elm's FFI for javascript interoperation.  &gt; Which resources were you using?  Just a cloned copy of https://github.com/evancz/Elm and https://github.com/evancz/elm-lang.org - I did not try your thesis or any of the videos.  &gt; What is your background?  I mostly work on web applications that are written in Python in my job and I end up doing a lot of the javascript programming that they require. Most of the JS that I've written, I would identify as being terrible because it's too low-level. I sometimes flip a coin and write some program in either C or Haskell for fun. I taught myself Haskell by reading YAHT. I once learned a little bit of C++ and then forgot it on purpose.

He proposes that:  * ineluctably political in aims and motives ☑ * violent – or, equally important, threatens violence ☑ * designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target ☑ * conducted by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) ☑ * perpetrated by a subnational group or non-state entity ☑  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty  &gt; In Boston, another example of the violence they committed could be found in their treatment of a local stamp distributor, Andrew Oliver. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate, Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their violent actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.  Context is very important. His entire point could of been that the labeling something terrorist or extreme could really depend on context or perspective. If I say the phrase ""Hitler was the greatest example of an evil motherfucker"" you could quote me as saying ""Hitler is the greatest"". A terrorist to you could be a freedom fighter in their mind. The start of the video seems to show him making that kind of point about Christians (equally applicable to Muslims or Jews) that would cut your head off if you were not Christian.  Never trust 'evidence' that includes a bunch of jump cuts. Furthermore what amounts to a FEMA 'motivational speaker' does note exactly represent the views of an entire government agency.

t5_2rfxx,SilverFireStorm,1382656404,"Oh man, where do I even begin? League of Legends is pretty much an entirely different game from when I started playing, while still managing to stay...mostly true to the core of itself. Some of the things I talk about might blow your mind a little, but just know that all of it is true, and shows just how much League has evolved. And it probably won't be in the right order either.   When I first started playing League, we didn't have this ""standard meta"" of today. AD Carries were the primary mid-laners, bottom lane was pretty much dominated by Sion/Taric, and having a jungler was a luxury. Barely anybody even could jungle back then, b/c it was a scary place that almost no champion could actually survive in. In fact, the most common junglers were Warwick, Nunu, Rammus, Amumu, and Shaco, since they were the only ones that could really handle it.  In Season One, dodge was a stat on more than just Jax. You could get it from Ninja Tabi. Udyr and Sivir also had dodge chances on their passives, and Jax had a totally different reliance on dodge than he does now.  In Season One, there were certain comps that were just terrifying to face, and created extremely tense match-ups. Things like a full AoE comp of Galio, Amumu, Miss Fortune, Sona, and Katarina would literally 100-0 an entire team by just pressing R at the right moment. Of course, the enemy team would have a similar comp, so it became a battle of which team could press R faster.  In Season One, stealth champions struck true fear into our hearts. Both Twitch and Evelynn, had pretty much perma-stealth capabilities, and could be anywhere at anytime. Worse, Eve used to have a skill that caused her to stun an opponent for 2 seconds if she used it to break out of her stealth. If there was an Eve in your game, and she was good, you lost. Pink wards didn't even matter to her after the first 2-3 kills. Which is why Eve got completely destroyed in every single way for over 2 years while Riot tried to fix her.  It was the Season One Championships that caused this ""standard meta"" to occur. The Europeans teams wiped the floor with North America using a tanky top, roaming jungler, AP mid, and an AD Carry with a Support (oh yeah, and Marksmen were called AD Carries until recently).  If you played Ranked during Season One, being Bronze was an accomplishment. You had to earn that Bronze rank. We had Elo in Seasons One and Two, and it determined your worth. If you were under Bronze, you were just unranked. Being Silver was actually worth something too, and Gold was still the place to be. Barely anyone was ""Diamond"", and the pros back then were considered true gods.  Once Season Two rolled around, it was an entirely different ball-game. Many things were turned upside-down and changed in ways that were hard to grasp at first. For one thing, the jungle was actually farmable now, and no longer a scary death forest. AD Carries and Supports were cemented in bottom lane to funnel the gold, while AP Carries were sent to mid to gain their levels and roam around. Dragon started becoming more important, and objectives in general were slowly being valued more.  I believe that the first major shake-up that hit in Season Two was the release of Jarvan Lightshield IV, Exemplar of Demacia. This guy changed the game of League forever, and ushered in an era known as ""The Metagolem."" With a Trinity Force at the Head, a body of Warmog's Armor reinforced with Force of Nature, a Frozen Mallet in one hand and an Atma's Impaler in the other, with Mercury Treads on its feet and an explosion of Flash in the background, J4 could literally 1v5 an entire enemy team, and walk out with about half-health. AoEs comp went almost extinct because of him alone, with his ability to tank every single skill you could throw at him, and still kill all of you without breaking a sweat.  Another catastrophic change to League came with one of the most over-powered released Riot has ever done. What stopped the rise of J4 and Bruisers worldwide. That would be Vayne, the Night Stalker. Release Vayne could two-shot anything on the map with a Trinity Force, Bloodthirster, and Last Whisper/Phantom Dancer. Nowhere was safe from her, and nothing could stop her once she started rolling. She was, and still is in some form, one of the closest things to a Hypercarry League may ever know.  I can't talk about Season Two without referring to the Great Solar Flare of Riot Games. With the release of Leona, The Radiant Dawn, League went through multiple crashes over the span of about a week. It was a rather dark time, and I don't think any old player will ever forget it.  Season Two continued to teach us what real fear was with the inclusion of Nocturne, The Eternal Nightmare. The first few times we saw his ult, it was guaranteed to make you jump out of your seat. We may have already learned about the importance of warding (somewhat), but Nocturne taught us what it meant to be over-extended by a single step.  We also saw our share of under-powered or under-appreciated releases. Yorick Mori, the Gravedigger, was quite possible the most underpower champion to ever be released. In fact, he was so weak and bugged, that it was possible to repeatedly kill him hundreds of times within a few minutes. Of course, once Yorick was fixed and buffed up a fair margin, he became the true terror of top lane. You didn't defeat Yorick Mori in lane. You merely survived it.  Season Two also gave us the most under-appreciated Champion for months at a time. The release of Orianna, the Lady of Clockwork, showed just how unskilled the average person, and ever our pros, could be. She was deemed completely unviable, absolute trash, a waste of a champion slot, etc. Until one day, the pros started seeing what she was really meant to do. After the first few months of nothing happening to her, suddenly Orianna became a must ban/first pick in the highest levels of play. Her zoning capability was high enough to completely control ALL of the mid lane with literally no effort, once you knew what you were doing. No one could lane against her. She knew what made you tick. She knew how to make the ticking...stop. So naturally, and for good reason, she got huge range and damage nerfs across the board.  All sorts of champions came out in Season Two, but none were as hyped as the legendary Lee Sin, The Blind Monk. In fact, Lee Sin was considered by most of us to be a troll champion that would never actually be released. It didn't help that he was being released on April Fool's Day. However, the joke was on us, for he was actually brought out to the public! Except, much like with Orianna, he was considered underpowered due to his kit being so versatile. Of course, once people saw his true potential, and he got a few buffs, he became unstoppable. And then he got nerfed and became unplayable. And then he got buffed and...you get the idea.  There's a countless amount of other stuff that happened in the time I've played League of Legends. Items have been buffed, nerfed, removed, replaced, added, and outright changed. Most all champions have had their rise and falls in power. Reworks have touched nearly every aspect of the game, for good and evil, sometimes multiple times in a row. Pro players have been cycled and recycled in popularity. Elo has been changed, re-changed, re-structured again, and then ""removed"" for the Leagues system.  All in all, if you want to know all that's happened, be prepared for posts like mine. There's a lot that's happened in League's time as a game. And one thing is certain: We haven't seen anything yet. Prepare for even more things to change very....""Soon™"".  TL;DR: What's changed since Season One? The short answer: Everything. Long answer? Read above.",™

Let's talk about math.  Excluding folks with certain learning disabilities or other handicaps, I don't think some people are born ""good"" at math and others born ""bad"" at math.  Of course I do think there are natural differentials in skill and I agree that not everyone will be able to be a world-class mathematician anymore than everyone could be able to be an olympic sprinter.  But let's talk about the average cases and not the exceptional ones.  I think that over the course of their lives students internalize their struggles and successes with a subject and absorb those struggles and successes into their identity.  They move from ""I was not able to do that math problem"" to ""I am not a Math Person™.""  I believe it's really a kind of psychological trauma and people develop beliefs like ""I'm not a math person"" or ""I'm not a sports person"" or ""I'm not a musical person"" as a way to preserve their ego.  If you're not a math person then it's understandable—even forgivable—that you're no good at math.  That's just the way it is, like the Earth orbiting around the sun.  I've had students come to me saying all the horseshit you're saying now and leave saying they're no longer afraid of math/computer science/whatever.  One student in particular emailed about six months later saying, ""I used to think I was terrible at math, but after a particular conversation I had with you I stopped being so afraid.  I enrolled in a Masters program in Computer Science and now have a job as a software engineer at a bank in NYC.  Attached is the code from my Operating Systems final.""  If you believe you can't learn something you won't be able to learn it.  It's a self-fulfilling belief.  ""Am I able to learn this or not?"" is a pointless question.  ""What would it take to learn this?"" is a better question.  Still better are questions like ""How did other people learn this?"", ""How am I trying to learn this?"", ""Are there other approaches to learning this that I might consider?"", ""What's working for me in my approach to learning, what isn't, and which are the easiest to address?"", and so on.  &gt; ""For most children at school, the problem is not that they do not understand particular mathematical structures or concepts. Rather, they do not understand what kind of thing a mathematical structure is: they do not see the point of the whole enterprise. Asking them to learn it is like asking them to learn poetry in a completely unknown foreign language."" &gt; &gt;—Seymour Papert, *Teaching Children to be Mathematicians vs. Teaching About Mathematics*",™

t5_2rjto,slippery_people,1382658462,"[Jonathan Pollard was a lunatic who did serious damage to national security](http://cryptome.org/jya/traitor.htm). It really amazes me how ardent Israel and the Jews have been in campaigning for his release.   The whole legal issue is that Pollard pleaded guilty and still received a life sentence. However, his plea deal stated rather clearly:  &gt;Mr. Pollard understands that, while the Court may take his cooperation into account in determining whether or not to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, **this agreement cannot and does not limit the court's discretion to impose the maximum sentence**.  Evidently whatever Caspar Weinberger revealed about Pollard's treachery in that still-classified declaration was enough for the trial judge to decide life was warranted.  Moreover, Alan Dershowitz hilariously claims that Pollard got screwed over because *his appeal was heard by two Jewish judges*, one being Judge (now Justice) Ruth Ginsburg.  &gt;[Unfortunately Pollard's appeal was argued to a panel that included two Jewish judges, at least one of whom aspired to the Supreme Court](http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/jonathan-pollard-israel-spy/2011/08/17/id/407736).  Undoubtedly, Pollard's ordeal has made some people think twice before committing treason to benefit ""America's Greatest Ally^(®)""—so my theory is Israel wants him released to lower the market price on would-be double agents.  He's apparently eligible for parole in a few years because his crime occurred [before Nov. 1, 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Parole_Commission).",®

This ""corporate right"" is what gives the inventor an incitement, and protects him from the bigger corporations (except for those in China and India).  I don't really understand your reference to the steam engine. There were plenty of steam engines, and the big ones were all patented by the inventors? It's not as if someone can patent the whole process of steam driving a machine, but instead they patent the New and Improved Steam Engine 2.0™ that they'd personally been working on and had schematics of.

Here's your source, cunt.    Oral contraceptives: Studies have found that women using oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have a slightly greater risk of breast cancer than women who have never used them. This risk seems to go back to normal over time once the pills are stopped. Women who stopped using oral contraceptives more than 10 years ago do not appear to have any increased breast cancer risk. When thinking about using oral contraceptives, women should discuss their other risk factors for breast cancer with their health care team.  Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA; Depo-Provera®) is an injectable form of progesterone that is given once every 3 months as birth control. A few studies have looked at the effect of DMPA on breast cancer risk. Women currently using DMPA seem to have an increase in risk, but the risk doesn’t seem to be increased if this drug was used more than 5 years ago.  - cancer.org",®

I look at the stars and imagine myself flying through them,  sometimes sprinkling pixie dust over the home s of those I love.  Being this fairy gives me the ability to mentally visualize leaving my problems behind and provides an escape.  Helps me drift off to sleep,  too. I know it sounds stupid but i remember escaping this way as a kid and for some reason,  some stupid adult bullshit made us believe we should grow out of this practice.  If you can't get into it,  with your own character of course,  I hope at least you can laugh knowing there is a 27 year old nursing student out there managing the stress of patients dying by imagining she's a fairy.  ♥",♥

I can’t even tell you how heavy this has been on my heart for the last 24 hours and, how many conversations we’ve had with the design team about this feedback!  Our customers are seriously our world, so, we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we can improve.  As for your points: it looks like your main issues you had are with the loafer sock.  The loafer sock was from our first production run of socks, and, we admit that the knit density on the sole of the feet was not perfect. With your loafer socks, we had purposefully left the threads longer, as we found that cutting them would have reduced the structural integrity of the socks.  However, we quickly learned that people had similar feedback to yours, so, for the dress socks (which were from the next production batch), we have the threads trimmed a lot closer.  In addition, we're considering changing the logo placement (as I saw in the comments) based on customer feedback.   As for you, we'd love to refund your money and send you another pair of the dress socks so that you can see the difference.  Email us at Q@ministryofsupply.com so that we can make that happen.  Everyone else – I’m getting your protos out to you pronto!  We got over 300 Reddit requests, and, I wanted to fulfill them all, despite that fact that we only had 100 protos in the office.  So, I shipped out the 100 that we had, and, had to wait on the additional 200, which caused the process to take a little longer than expected.  Plus, I wanted to write y’all handwritten cards.

t5_2tugi,jbacon,1382712440,"&gt; Automatic two way binding between view and model  In Angular, your model is just a set of properties on a particular scope (a scope is created by several Angular directives, in this case a controller).  So, let's say I had a simple form like this:      &lt;form ng-controller=""TestController"" ng-submit=""onSubmit()""&gt;         &lt;input ng-model=""model.field1"" type=""text""&gt;         &lt;input type=""submit""&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;  Here, I've created a scope to the form and bound it to a controller called TestController via the ng-controller directive.  I've also told Angular to call the onSubmit() method of my controller when I submit the form, via the ng-submit directive.    I've bound the field to the scope via the ng-model directive, and that's where the two way binding comes in.  Any time the value in the form input field changes or the model field is modified by a controller in that scope, the model and view will be updated accordingly.  If I type something else in the box, then that value is immediately available to anything in the scope via $scope.model.field1.  If I change $scope.model.field1 from any other code in the scope, it will be updated in the textfield automatically.  That's two-way data binding.    Hopefully that made sense, since there was a lot of Angular-speak in there...  &gt; Routing  Routing is a critical element for a frontend application of any size.  On the frontend, this is usually implemented via URL hashes (aka fragments) - http://www.site.com/#route1/endpoint1.  The hash/fragment is everything after the '#' character in a URL.  A frontend routing system watches the URL hash and parses it whenever it changes.  If a route is configured for that hash, then whatever you wanted to do when that route is called is executed.    The most important use of routing is that it allows you to easily decouple your code.  Your code doesn't have to know anything specific about other code, it only has to change the hash to something, and things happen.  Magic!  &gt; Service layer  This is an Angular specific feature out of the box, but you could implement a service layer in any framework that's worth anything.  This is just an architectural element that you'd need in a larger application.  It's a good place to store business logic, so you can keep it out of your controllers and views.    For example, let's say I have an application where the user is updating a Widget object.  However, a Foo object also needs to be updated when a Widget is updated - where should that operation go?  We don't want it in the Widget model, since Widget doesn't really care about Foo.  We don't want it in the controller, since the controller cares nothing for data.  We don't want it in the view, since that's straight up crazy.  So, we write a WidgetUpdateService.  Now, the controller just calls WidgetUpdateService.update(widget), and the service layer handles all the business logic magic, like updating Foo as well.    &gt; Trivializes REST requests to the backend  Angular is really nice about this.  As long as you write RESTful endpoints, an Angular $resource object will Just Work™.  You can call myResource.query() to get a list of all objects, myResource.save() to POST a new object, etc.  The best part is that you can assign Angular scope values to a resource result, and Angular manages the callbacks for you.  So I would just write:      $scope.resourceList = myResource.query()  query() is asynchronous, but I don't have to care!  Angular will automagically update the view once the request completes.  So if I had a view that lists each resource and my data comes from a RESTful backend, my controller is literally that one line above, and my view is this:        &lt;table ng-controller=""MyController""&gt;     &lt;tbody&gt;     &lt;tr ng-repeat=""resource in resourceList""&gt;     &lt;td&gt;{{ resource.property1 }}&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;{{ resource.property2 }}&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;/tbody&gt;     &lt;/table&gt;  And so, I've just made a list view for a backend resource in like ten seconds.    Long story short, Angular is really awesome!",™

t5_2qmg3,Fludbucket,1382717613,"MMA is vastly safer then boxing. Think of it this way in Boxing you get knocked down...you're concussed you get a standing 8 count and you fight some more. Not only that but in boxing you have two ways to win, punch the body or punch the head. In MMA you have leg kicks, wrestling, Submissions. Also the first time you stop blocking mma (defending yourself) the fight is over.  &gt;According to the Johns Hopkins study, head trauma and cerebral hemorrhages are the No. 1 cause of death in combat sports. The study concludes that boxing is the most dangerous combat sport in America.  &gt;That conclusion should not surprise fans who understand and appreciate the sport. Research in the American Association of Neurological Surgeons' 2006 study pointed out that the average direct hit to the head that a boxer sustains is equivalent to being hit with a 12-pound wooden mallet traveling at around 20 miles per hour.  &gt;It doesn’t take a doctor to understand why 12 rounds of hard hits to the head can cause serious damage to a boxer’s brain, skull and the surrounding blood-vessels. In contrast, only 25% of MMA fights continued, without knockouts, to their end without knockouts, which in the UFC, the premier MMA brand, occurs at only 3 rounds for non-championship fights and 5 rounds for title fights.  &gt;So the next time you watch an MMA event, consider that when a fighter is knocked out, the fight is over. In boxing events, fighters that are knocked out get a standing eight count, and their opponent continues to inflict blows to the fighter’s already damaged head.  Also  &gt;e British Board of Sports Medicine studied 635 MMA fights that occurred in Nevada from 2002 to 2007. The following is taken from their recent released report. PEOPLE GET HURT FIGHTING…PERIOD! , First of all, roughly only 25 % of MMA fights went the distance which in  the UFC, the premier MMA brand, are 3 rounds for non-championship fights and 5 rounds for title fights. 35 % of the fights ended in submission, and 34 % ended with the referee halting the action. As for knockouts, only 3.3% of fights ended by KO. All that being said, overall 1 in 4 (25 %) of MMA participants during this five year period were injured in battle. And while these numbers sound alarming, they really arent. THE DOCUMENTED NUMBERS  &gt;It wasnt a shocker that those losing suffered more injuries than the winners, with victors injured roughly 15% of the time, while guys on the short end were hurt at double that rate, or 31%. Ringside Dr.s stopped 3% of the fights. Disqualifications totaled a mere .08%. Some other figures stated that 17% of the fighters were cut in matches, while eye injuries were rated at 5 Î© %. Facial injuries were involved in 10% of all injuries. SERIOUS INJURIES: MMA VS. BOXING The real telling statistic put forth by the British Journal of Sports Medicine involved the injury most serious, the one that makes fighters stutter, stumble, and end up suffering what MDs call Pugilistic Dementia, Punch Drunk to the layman. While better than 10% of boxing matches involve severe concussions, the studys work that should send the boxing world stumbling, is that in five years of MMA fights in Nevada, only 1.5% of the combatants suffered severe concussions.  BOXERS, CHRIS BENOIT &amp; NFL PLAYERS &gt;Besides boxers, NFL players like Steve Young, Troy Aikman and others suffered multiple concussions and brought about their early retirement. WWE wrestler Chris Benoit, who last July killed his wife and son, this before hanging himself at his home in an Atlanta, GA suburb, post mortem examinations revealed that Benoit had suffered so many severe and repetitive concussions, that his brain mirrored that of an old man with advanced Alzheimers Disease.  &gt;FEW REFEREES KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS Time and again, youve seen boxers get dropped hard, sometimes with such force that hitting the deck is what wakes them up. Being neurologically short-circuited or concussed once is sufficient reason to stop a fight right then and there. Instead, more often than not, boxers are asked by referees, are you OK? Some of the good refs wont take the verbal assurances of a fighter and let a contest continue. SPIDERMAN GIVES REF SUPREME RATING  &gt;California referee Jon Schorle, himself a former amateur fighter, whose work has illustrated an uncanny ability to stop fights, both boxing and MMA, at the right time, will direct a fighter to take two steps towards him in order to try and determine whether the fighters head is scrambled. Retired Texas referee/judge Arlen Spider Bynum thinks that Schorles adroit ability to stop a fight is uncanny. There have been fights involving Schorle in which if he were to stop a fight one punch prior, or one punch later, Id have been pissed. BOXINGS MENTALITY INCREASE DEMENTIA  &gt;The fact that in boxing, fighters are allowed to take drubbings, sometimes round after round, for upwards of 10 or 12 rounds, is whats wrong with the game. To allow a fighter to endure repeated punishment for a prolonged period of time to me is barbaric. In order to reduce repetitive concussions, the mentality that drives the boxing game needs to be changed. The reason why MMA fighters suffer serious injuries far less than boxers, I believe, is that MMA referees are prone to jump in and stop a fight before a fighter is severely hurt. If only the vast majority of boxing referees could see the light. ",©

It sucks your shit gets stolen, but there's nothing you can do about it. Shitting on your photo doesn't help, but at least you still can usually get credit in some way or the other that you would have never gotten if you try and resolve the issue. You won't get money, your photos are not copyrighted properly, but you should do that then try and extract money out of people you catch stealing the shot. You can also ask to be credited.   People who steal your work were never going to pay for it in the first place. You are as dumb as the RIAA if you think that you are somehow going to stop that and that it is always going to be bad.

Our children and knowing there is one other person that loves them as much as I do. To know he has my back and I have his. Doing and saying small things to and for each other because we just like to. To know that he not only loves me, he likes me and I I love and like him...we're friends, not just lovers. The sex just keeps getting better and better. 😃  We share the hardest things we have to go through--together. And that makes it easier to deal with and is so comforting. I love just getting to snuggle up to him at the end of the day. I love making him happy and letting him know that I believe he can do anything he sets his mind to. I've had chronic illnesses to deal with and feel so bad that I am a burden to him or our kids but he assures me I'm not and lets me know how much he appreciates me and finds me sexy.

t5_2ranw,gracebatmonkey,1382764421,"This has helped me when I've been in a similar situation:  **Desiderata**  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2rrlp,M_Redfield,1382771360,"After mulling it over, I'm pretty sure this is correct.  Let's look deeper into this:  &gt;Games you purchase can be downloaded and played on any PS4™ system if you sign in to PSN℠. There is no limit on the number of systems you can use. * Only you can start games that you download.  Not the placement of the asterisk - it's before the next line, not after "".. use.""    Here's the asterisk detail:  &gt;* You can use up to 2 systems concurrently: the system activated as your ""primary"" PS4™ system, and one other system.  So with these two things said, it seems pretty much identical to the PS3, except that in order to start the game, you must be signed in to the account that downloaded it on the ""secondary"" PS4, but you can play it on any account on the ""primary"" PS4.  Essentially, if you digitally swap primary and secondary with your brother, you should be set. You buy the game as primary, deactivate - he activates under your account on his PS4 and downloads. Now he can play under his account on the ""primary"" PS4, and you are ""forced"" to play it on your account(the proper account) on the ""secondary"" PS4.  Obviously this requires a huge amount of trust with the person you're swapping control of your account with, and for the person buying the games to only have one account the like to play it on, but it would work. I can see it being used for brothers/marriages/deployments/long-distance relationships. Not a huge portion of the gaming community, so it's not like Sony has much to worry about.    **Edit-**  **I just thought of an extremely easy way of doing this, you don't even have to deactivate systems.**  Just swap usernames with your partner. If your username is, say, Jill_Valentine, and your partner is Chris_Redfield, register *your* account under Chris_Redfield, and register under Jill_Valentine. You then each create your respective 'secondary' accounts on your respective PS3s - the other usernames.  Now, they play on the account you registered - their actual username on *your* secondary PS4, and vice versa. No activating/deactivating systems required, just a bit of foresight when setting it all up and some dedication to your partner.    I'll shorthand it here:  * System 1(Jill's system) - registers the primary account for the username ""Chris"".  * System 2(Chris' system) - registers the primary account for the username ""Jill"".  * System 1 now creates a second account, using the info for the username ""Jill"" that Chris made.  * System 2 does the same for the info that Chris made - ""Chris"".  * Jill(System 1) plays under ""Jill""(Secondary account on her system), but buys things for them under ""Chris"", since ""Chris"" is the primary on that system and all accounts can play anything bought.  * Chris(System 2) plays under ""Chris""(Secondary account on his system), but buys things under ""Jill"".        Obviously this isn't flawless - you still have the account limitation on the secondary PS4, so if you're one of those who has 15 different usernames on your PS3, this won't jive well with you.   The only way for Sony to halt this would be to crack down on the secondary PS4 by making sure the primary PS4 isn't currently running the game. However, that would required always-on DRM on three sides of the triangle - Primary PS4, Secondary PS4 and a dedicated server checking every single user and game on the PSN at every moment. Extremely expensive and not worth it to curb something that most likely wouldn't have been a sale anyway.  ",™

t5_2rxrw,haharae,1382795588,"I find your first question to be a bit presumptuous. That would imply that there is, in fact, a patriarchy. ""Patriarchy"" is like a religious god. You can't prove or (most importantly to many feminists) disprove it, so people use to it as an excuse for their problems. There is no part of a patriarchy that's hindering others, but people insist that it has some overarching influence. They're ignoring the fact that culture itself reinforces social structures and that the people who do reinforce these social structures are both men AND women. It's largely a way to blame men and act as if women are innocent and powerless and if they do anything to support it, then they're just helping men. In essence, the idea of the possibility of existence of a patriarchy is ironic due to its contradictory nature in relation to feminism.  Feminism is also a broad term, which is why you get people saying one thing while others are saying another. Male support is helpful to some types of feminism, but it's a hindrance to others. You'll get feminists who say any other type of feminism besides their own are no ""True Feminists™,"" but I encourage you to ignore these people. They're often unable to comprehend that there are divisions within the feminist movement and incapable of seeing the flaws of it.  Again, depending on the branch feminism, this can be both possible and impossible. Some branches require that men sit down, shut up, and watch their male friends with paranoia, constantly lecturing other men on how they're always in the wrong for expressing sexuality in any way. Other branches say no, men have an equal part in feminism's discourses and struggles just as women have an equal part in men's.",™

Do you plan to release new trials or characters?  It would be cool to equip your Gladiator with new gear, even if it has no impact on the game - some Skins, just like in League of Legends, or maybe unlockable weapons for the Gladiators with different abilities (Boomerang, Blow pipe for Archers f.e.), will we be seeing some of that soonish™?  Will you release the Kraken?  Woops, will you release a Trialbuilder so players can create, share and play other ppls trials?

t5_2r9ei,Elliptical_Tangent,1382847104,"&gt; or the DM should kill them dramatically, in my mind.  That's the epitome of Bad™.  DM railroads the character's death for his beloved story.  If you want a dramatic death, write a novel.  Don't invalidate a player's time spent developing their character just to feed your own ego.  RPGs are about _collaborative_ storytelling, not storytelling at the DM's whim.  Occasionally, a death happens at a pivotal moment in the story and it's horrible/awesome.  It's incredibly powerful because of it's rarity and authenticity.  It's the kind of story you tell to people who then tell other people.  Even people who don't play.  Getting railroaded to death is never a story that gets retold.  Unless it's to explain why you're late getting home.  ""Yeah my DM decided to kill my character in some dramatic scene that went on and on.  I don't think he understood that I liked the character more than his scene, and so he just kept elaborating on the scene like I'd change my mind.  Kept telling me how this npc and that npc were crying for me and stuff.  I didn't even like those guys.""",™

t5_2t403,MrSketchCity,1382850366,"[](/raritygrin)I think a lot of content creators would agree that posting their stuff is fine, as it generally gives them exposure. BUT ONLY if...  a) The link is a direct link to the source or  b) A link to the source is provided by OP  I see that Webcomics are big for ignoring these things. People will just re-host one comic and end it at that without giving a proper source. At that point, I think it should just be common courtesy to provide where the source is. It's still not as good as linking to the direct source, but I suppose 30 hits is better than none  I know a content creator whose stuff has reached the front page of Reddit multiple times, but has reaped none of the benefits because the links were all mirrors without providing a proper source. Some posts had hundred of thousands of views, he received maybe 30 hits when someone finally posted a source in the comments  The other thing that's just not cool, especially when it comes to webcomics is when someone will cut off the footer to make identifying the source even more difficult. Take this [Awkward Zombie](http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f278/katietiedrich/comic324_zps6aad64ad.png) comic for instance. People will often cut off the '© Katie Tiedrich - www.awkwardzombie.com' at the bottom before re-hosting it. And this happens countless times with webcomics. That's just... not cool. Why do people do it? To try to pass it off as their own? That's just kind of sad  We're all guilty of improper sourcing from time to time, but it's something we can all change. And often, it's actually less work than re-hosting, so we need to start giving proper sources   That was more words than I planned, but I think I got everything I needed to say there",©

I know!! Hopefully, there will be some explaining. I'll be so disappointed if they just start the next episode with Cas already gone. I want to see what Sammy says and I want to see Dean suffering and Cas suffering because it's wrong for them to be apart and they all know it!! T__T  I will definitely keep watching. Sam is really interesting this season (and shiny! and pretty!), so I definitely want to know what's going to happen with him. Cas being human is really intriguing and so are the bad angels. There's plenty of stuff for me to be excited about. I'm more distressed about the people behind the scenes and how some of them acted to fans. If I hadn't known about all the Twitter nonsense and whatnot, I wouldn't have felt bad about my ship because, all in all, I don't think this episode damaged it. Dean was still hunting for Cas like he always does, because he loves him, and Cas had strong moments with Dean, particularly his sad puppy eyes at the end. I just hope they don't cheapen or downplay the importance of their relationship just so that they can seem No Homo. Whether it's romantic or not, Destiel is amazing and I love to watch it. They make me wanna cry a lot. So... that's the only thing that can worry me about the show. If their feelings seem less strong for any reason. I don't think that's happening yet. It was really clear Dean's heart twisted into knots at having to kick Cas out, and Cas' face needed no words.  &gt; Don't be sad! Your infectious love of the show is awesome! Keep rockin' it!

t5_2yk5v,greenduch,1382894536,"Some questions-  &gt;If you regard a love of pink, frills, makeup, and high heels as evidence that a person is really female deep inside, you are not a feminist.  Is this a thing that trans people actually believe? It isn't something trans folks in my social circles believe, or something I've particularly heard from folks online. Then again, I suppose sometimes folks might hint at thinking that without outright saying it- but non-trans people think that just as much as anyone else. If anything, the trans folks I know are more aware of stuff like this being bullshit, compared to the non-trans population at large.   &gt;If you uncritically believe in “brain sex,” you are not a feminist.  I do kinda think sometimes folks rely too much on the idea of ""brain sex""- though I think when radfems use that word, they mean like, that ""men are from mars, women are from venus"" biotruths bullshit which is super gross. Which, from my understanding, isn't the sort of thing that (most) trans activists mean when they use that terminology.   Though in fairness there isn't really a consensus on that, and trans folks arent a hivemind, so yeah.   I'm not a neuroscientist, and I'm not educated enough on that particular subject, so i kinda tend to stay out of that whole discussion. With the exception of terrible and dated shit like the [COGIATI](http://transsexual.org/cogiati_english.html), which is considered so stupid and damaging that /r/transgendercirclejerk bases their CSS around it,^1 I really don't see folks get into bullshit ::biotruths:: arguments.  &gt;If you spend more time railing against “lesbian transphobia” than you do against the people who rape, disparage and degrade those who do not conform to gender expectations, you are not a feminist.  yeah tbh the focus on that, among a small group of people, rather than other shit is a bit... idk. not great.  &gt;If you believe that gender nonconforming children need medical or psychological evaluation, you are not a feminist.  Yeah I'm pretty happy that it never occurred to my parents to send me out for evaluation because of my gender presentation. But I do think that if a child is showing a rather massive amount of distress, its probably a good idea to take a look at that and see if theres something else going on other than just being gender non conforming.   ~  ^(1: fun fact- I took the COGIATI once. I had hoped that my ability to parallel park would help my score, but unfortunately my inability to math set me back, so alas I am not a LEVEL ONE TRUE TRANSSEXUAL™)  Edit: [a good piece by a trans person about how terrible the COGIATI is](http://queereka.com/2012/01/11/debunking-the-cogiati/), and why those sorts of ideas about ""brain sex"" are absurd.",™

If you can only wear a device for 20 minutes before getting sick and having physical reference points gets around that, I'll take the physical reference points. CastAR references a fixed real-world position, Rift does not. A prime cause of nausea from Rift is not because of the tracker refresh rate, it's because there is drift in the accelerometer tracking meaning you can get a difference between what the tracking says versus your inner ear. When doing optical tracking of fixed known points you get sub-millimeter tracking accuracy.  &gt; dim shutter glasses (useless for VR HMD) - projected AR is the main focus  The shutters will be left wide open (transparent) when in the VR mode because there is no need to worry about the slight cross talk from the retroreflective surface when in VR mode (the RR surface is not used with the VR clipons, each eye only gets video from its projector).  &gt; does not completely cut you off from the room  This is optional, the VR clipons can be left semi-reflective or a cover can be put on them blocking out all the external room lighting.  &gt; what's the point in focusing on silly fake-AR when your device supposedly can do the best VR in the world? In other words: the Catch™  Per the ""gotcha"" you think you found (""They changed their statement about nausea and now they admit that it is also a problem for CastAR""), the full VR mode where you can't see the room can cause nausea. That's why the AR mode is exciting, it gets around the inherent disorientation problems with near to eye displays.",™

t5_2s3qj,ryanzhoutong,1382916220,"Hi all,  I have spent my weekend on this personal project that allows everyone in Australia to pay their utility bills, mobile phone bills, school fees, council rates and even some insurance premiums. As long as you see the POSTbillpay® logo on your bill, you can use the service.   The main differentiation of Bitbillpay compared to other similar services (if any) is that the payment process is entirely instant. So you are able to get your bills paid instantly with Bitcoin and obtain the receipt number (exactly the same as if you pay via POSTbillpay directly) within 60 seconds. Many of my friends think it's even faster to use Bitbillpay than POSTbillpay.  BPAY bills aren't supported yet, but if there's enough demand I will consider it. Also once the website has reached A$1 million in cumulative transactions, I will open source it.  I'm a co-founder of CoinJar and Bitbillpay's Bitcoin checkout solution is entirely powered by CoinJar Checkout. By using the service you'll also experience the power of CoinJar Checkout API and the seamless experience you can deliver on your own site.   Feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions in this thread.",®

Pretty often, actually.  A lot of ""good"" play in Dota isn't about flashy stuff, it's about fundamentals and doing things correctly.  I'd find a Drow that can maintain 800gpm against a competent enemy team a lot more interesting than Standard Rubick Play, version 38.™  &gt;  looks like terrible play from the opponents more than actual skill by the submitter  This is probably 70% or more of the *selected* clips in DC's videos, let alone *submitted* clips.

Oh yeah, here the am blinks in, blows up two supports, and exits yet another team fight to delay the game, and then a-clicks to victory 20 minutes later with six full slots.

I like to think that is because I'm smart, but realistically, it's more likely because I use the recommended settings and procedures.  Funny thing is, most of my clients usually call me only once a year or so for tune-ups.  After their first exposure to an infection, they don't often get infected again.  I am my own worst enemy, in that I take time to actually teach them what not to do.  They always say ""But other techs don't explain it the way you do.""  So perhaps people who hate IE are part of the problem?  Maybe you just don't comprehend what you're doing wrong?  Or perhaps we could lay off the childish ""my computer's better than yours, and my Dad can beat up your dad"" B.S.  (Just needed to get that off my frontal lobes.  ☺). ",☺

t5_2qh4j,CountVonTroll,1382930736,"Trial and error. :)  The US system is idealistic, there wasn't much in terms of practical experience to look at. It's based on geography, and the idealistic assumption that people from one electoral district would elect the most able representative to defend their district's interest in a chamber where reason would prevail.   The flaw, IMHO, lies in this assumption. In reality, regional considerations play a minor role in political convictions, and as a result the parties emerged as electoral clubs to bundle votes of similarly thinking people behind a common candidate, and the FPTP system dictates that there can only two dominant parties which are primarily concerned with keeping the other guy from winning. That's what makes it so polarized and inherently destructive.  The German constitution was written when there already was a lot of experience with other systems, not least our own from the Weimar Republic. In some ways, it's German Democracy 2.0, now with [Fortified Democracy™](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streitbare_Demokratie). They took the Weimar Constitution, looked at everything that had lead to instability and loopholes that were exploited by the Nazis (""Interesting, it doesn't say anywhere that you can't be chancellor and president at the same time, apparently we have to make it explicit.""), and fixed it. This brought us concepts like e.g., the *constructive* vote of non-confidence. In the Weimar Republic, the Nazis and the Communists sometimes voted together to remove the chancellor from office, but of course couldn't agree on a common candidate to replace him. Now, chancellors are removed from office by simply electing a new one, so there's no gap. It goes on like this; if you want to properly understand the Basic Law, you have to look at the Weimar Constitution and how Hitler came to power, it's actually quite fascinating.  ",™

It's a crushingly sad story about a girl who runs off to Hollywood to live her Hollywood™ dream of movie-star fame and movie-like love, but she finds that Hollywood™ isn't there for her. There's only her same self and similar life, with its usual disappointments—made worse by her being surrounded by people who *appear*, right next to her, every day, to inhabit the Hollywood™ of her dreams. They do this in a way she can't emulate, penetrate, or even coherently imagine. After one environment-exacerbated disappointment too many, she flees into fantasy. But she finds she can't inhabit her old imaginary Hollywood™ anymore. Fragments and distorted reminders of her real Hollywood sadness, isolation, and bafflement at the secret(s) that must be behind other people's better lives—all these keep intruding. The Hollywood™ from the movies that she thought she could run off to to change everything, it's been corrupted and replaced by her actual Hollywood life. She can't even summon an *imaginary* better world anymore. The only fantasy retreat she had, her only refuge from pain, she destroyed. So she kills herself.  Good story!

t5_2snuc,Mejari,1382939864,"&gt;So the atheist is incapable of truth?  As others have pointed out you are conflating ""truth"" with ""belief"", so I won't re-explain that.  &gt;The atheist door would be one of Atheistic Truth.  There is no such thing as an ""Atheistic Truth"". Being an atheist does not make any claims about reality. Being an atheist means you do not accept other people's claims about reality. That is a major flaw in your analogy, in that I don't need to choose some other door to choose not to go in yours.  I'll say that again, since it kind of cuts to the essence of what is wrong with your analogy:  **I don't need to choose some other door to choose not to go in yours.** Not accepting one claim does not mean I have to accept some other claim.  This is similar to how some religious people ask the question ""How did the first living organism come about?"" The answer is often ""Well, there are lots of theories out there, but currently we don't know"". The annoying religious answer sometimes given is ""Hah! You don't know! So you can't say my answer of God Did It™ is wrong!"". And obviously that's absurd. I don't need to know or even claim a belief in how it happened to lack belief in your claim. This same reasoning holds for whether or not god exists at all. Or whether or not bigfoot exists.  &gt;Deciding to not choose is still a decision.  Maybe in a concrete example, like choosing not to divert a train off of a track full of children. But in the context of not accepting a claim, making a 'decision' is not relevant. The word 'atheist' doesn't say anything about decisions, it just simply says ""I lack belief in a god"". By not accepting your claim I am only deciding to not accept your claim, I am not deciding to accept some other claim.  &gt;Maybe one day I will have a bulletproof analogy! (realistically won't)  It's always good to keep trying! Just keep in mind that analogies are often inherently misleading (as in your introduction of 'decision' into it by making it a door analogy where a door must be chosen, whereas in real life you don't have to choose a door) and can obscure or easily mischaracterize an argument. To be fair, they can also sometimes make it clearer, but they are best used when useful and quickly abandoned when not. I wish you luck in your search for the perfect analogy! :)",™

t5_2ryc6,thatsboxy,1382941821," http://m.cancer.org/cancer/ovariancancer/detailedguide/ovarian-cancer-risk-factors  In some studies, researchers have found that using the fertility drug clomiphene citrate (Clomid®) for longer than one year may increase the risk for developing ovarian tumors. The risk seemed to be highest in women who did not get pregnant while on this drug. Fertility drugs seem to increase the risk of the type of ovarian tumors known as ""low malignant potential"" (described in the section, ""What is ovarian cancer?""). If you are taking fertility drugs, you should discuss the potential risks with your doctor. However, women who are infertile may be at higher risk (compared to fertile women) even if they don’t use fertility drugs. This might be in part because they haven't given birth or used birth control pills (which are protective). More research to clarify these relationships is now underway.  A quick Google search gave me that. Really your doctor should be telling you this...  This says six months or more and it increases the risk of uterine cancer. http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/i/drugrisk_cancer_2.htm  This journal article says the same http://m.aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/161/7/607.full  This article even says that doctors don't normally tell their patients this. http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ellenpainterdollar/2012/01/fertility-treatment-might-cause-ovarian-cancer-but-your-doctor-is-unlikely-to-tell-you-that/  I don't live in the USA anymore.

t5_2ruhy,TSPhoenix,1382955234,"Soon™*  The basic story is that Nintendo of America gets asked about this pretty frequently, and at first they were saying ""It is coming"" but in more recent interviews their messaging has changed to ""We are aware that this is a priority, but everything to do with the Wii U system software is handled in Japan so all we can really do is pass the message along"".  And based on how long it is taking one can only assume that in Japan Nintendo do not see this as much of a priority. Nintendo of Japan is notoriously cagey when it comes to things like this so basically we are in a *it happens when it happens* situation. To me this is pretty concerning, because the fact it isn't a priority isn't a good sign in terms of how Nintendo of Japan views their digital customers even if NoA does care.",™

There is also quite a [complex history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_Lithuania#In_independent_Lithuania) leading to this in modern Lithuania.  The situation is that there was a quiet and friendly period between the states and nations in Lithuania for some time.

t5_2rrlp,webb34,1382975385,"&gt; So this is just rumble right?  ~~No. It's literally the controllers ability to push back on the triggers. The controller can make it harder to push them down, and have them push back against you.~~ I was wrong([source](http://news.xbox.com/2013/09/games-forza-impulse-triggers)) They only rumble. Although this still introduces a new form of haptic feedback, which is extremely beneficial. While them not pushing back is disappointing, they still provide a new, natural way of communicating to the human, what is happening in-game. This is always a good thing. A trigger that pushed back would have been extremely impressive, and useful for haptics, but it apparently isn't happening.  There are ~~*also*~~ 4 rumble motors in the controller to provide more fidelity with what you feel using vibrations.  The addition of 4 rumble motors isn't a huge *change*, but it is a huge *development*. It means a lot. Much more than a touchpad which is probably only going to be used for maps, and menus. Again, this is fine, but not that big of a deal.  The triggers however, are a huge change *and* development.  &gt;didn't see a mention of 7 speakers  They say it has 7.1 surround sound.  &gt;the GameCom Commander shuts out distractions while immersing you in 7.1 Dolby® stereo surround sound.  &gt;But if I went up to someone on the street, highlighted a quarter circle and asked them if this was 1, 2, 3 or 4. They wouldn't know.   You're right, which is why they were numbered on the Xbox. [This is a quick sketch of what it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/DVXaDOo.png). You're telling me you couldn't figure out which number it's trying to tell you? Seems pretty obvious to me. And colors are actually quite arbitrary. How do you determine which is player 3? Purple? With numbers, I can point to exactly which portion of the screen I am controlling. I read from left to right, and top to bottom, so going form 1 to 4 is pretty easy to know which is which. Combine that with the fact that the direction of the light on the controller is already indicating which corner of the screen you are using, you pretty much have to get it before you even need to see the screen. You know there are 4 options, you can see the direction points to 4 possible locations, and it lights up to show you which.   Colors, you would have no idea. If I showed you just ""red"" and asked which section of the screen it is controlling, how in the hell could you tell? Sure you can put something on the screen like a little colored icon, but with the numbered-direction system, I don't even need to see the screen.",®

See how dissapointly mediocre and clichÃ© SH:DPjust made me want to go back and finish SH1, which I never got around tobeating. One ISO and EPSXE later I'm in Silent Hill running away from theterrible skinless dog and pterodactyls. Definitely not as scary as the firsttime around, but I fucking love the otherworld shit. This was released thesame year as RE3, so they knew ""running from zombies"" would be boring ashell. I love the pseudo open world. There are a bunch of buildings you cango into that you aren't explicitly told you can go into, and they reward youwith items or even story fragments (arguably not cool). Also harry scribbleson his map whats blocked off or where key items are which is so cool. I wishmore games did this. It really helps balance the frustration of labryntianlevels.  What's interesting is that you can totally completely miss pickingup some maps, which happened to me. I ended up reloading and doing ahalf-hour section of game again just to get a map. Same for the things thatallow you to get the better endings, they are easily missable.  Also somepuzzles were too obtuse (zodiac puzzle anyone). Also the story was one ofthose ""90% is explained in the last 15 minutes of the game"" which is badstorytelling. Definitley looking forward to 2 and 3 since I hear they arethe best of the bunch. Don't worry, I'm not going to get the HD collection.I found a neogaf (ew) thread about making the PC versions of 2 and 3 lookawesome so I might try that. I'm looking forward to 4 cause of it's premise,and I hear Origins is good too. Oh and I cant wait to see how ShatteredMemories is since that sounds really awesome (psych profile system, rebootof the first game, no way to fight back at all, praised use of wiimote). 2bfalso did a play thru of Homecoming which is bad and them playing bad gamesis great.  Silent Hill 2 So I actually wrote all of that last week and this week I played SH2. That was really great. After beating the game I realized the otherworld was pretty different than that from SH1, and I actually really missed it. But I can understand now why they didn't do it. I got the  [/s] ending.

This lets you see how you play without them, see what stats you need/want to boost, and lets you wait until you know what gear and skills you want to spec into.      **Shoot things Ranger**   Spec into attack speed and projectile/bow damage. try out all the gems you get, settle on one or two you like. Have both a single target and a group option.   Suggestions: Rain of Arrows, Poison Arrow, Split Arrow    **Smash things Marauder**   Spec into hp/defenses to start. Don't go 1h or 2h specifically off the bat. Try out melee gems until you find something you like, then look for passives/items to boost it.  Have a single target and a group ability.   Suggestions: Infernal Blow, Sweep, Cleave, Ground Slam, Leap Strike      **Freeze things Witch**   The witch more or less wants to spec into an element to start. They're all good, but I feel that cold is the most forgiving for new players.   Start off with spell damage and cast speed, then move up into boosting cold damage.  Many cold spells work for both single target and groups, which is a plus.  Pick up energy shield nodes when you can, and hold off on life nodes until you decide if you want to plan on Chaos Inoculation or not.   Suggestions: Ice Nova, Freezing Pulse, Ice spear       These are very general suggestions, but should give new players a basis to work from. The important thing to take away is A. its ok to save points, and B. go for generic passives first to leave yourself some flexibility.  Don't spread yourself too thin, but try to keep it open ended.",™

It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.  ----    *I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&amp;subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F1pexyi ""Confidence: 1.00"").

t5_2fwo,greyfade,1383008184,"&gt; As for ""U+200E,"" exactly how is one supposed to make use of that notation?  When you work with Unicode text for long enough, you get a sense of what code points are in the control characters ranges. There are some in the low ASCII area (less than 32), but most of the Unicode control codes and general punctuation live in U+20xx.  Ranges that you care about tend to be easy to remember. For example, I work, form time to time, with Japanese text, so I know that code points in the U+30xx area are kana.  But for people whose native language is not English, or for those who use internationalized keyboards, typing most accented characters is simple. To type é, all I have to do is hold down the AltGr key and press e. If I need ë, I can type AltGr+r or AltGr+"" then e. (I use International with Dead Keys, so the combining mark comes first. Most people use International without Dead Keys, so they type e, *then* AltGr+"".)  The same is true of non-Latin alphabets. Cyrillic users have Cyrillic keyboards. Japanese users have JIS-layout keyboards with a specialized ""shift"" key (eisū) to switch between Latin and Japanese characters.  Rarely do you care what code point you need. Only when you are performing processing or recognition of a string's contents that cares about languages would you bother even looking them up.  &gt; Do I have any choice whatsoever beyond finding, and trying to figure out a sane way to browse through, a picture dictionary of glyphs with -- potentially, someday -- 2^22 entries?  Yes, actually. The Unicode Consortium provides [code charts](http://www.unicode.org/charts/) which you can look through, and fileformat.info has a search engine.  In my own case, I was looking one day for a strokeless capital A (as is found in the Stargate SG-1 logo), and I found it rather easy to locate Ʌ (turned capital V) in the [Latin Extended-B](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf) block, to which I can combine the ""combining ring above"" from the [Combining Diacritical Marks](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf), to produce the iconic title:  STARGɅ̊TE. I can then type it rather simply: On Linux, Ctrl+Shift+U then the Unicode code point.  Of course, that's hardly a common need, but there are tools available to make these searches easier. Once you know the source language, even locating the characters for the famous glare emoji can be simple: It turns out the character is from [Kannada](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0C80.pdf), where we can find U+0CA0 ಠ to make the emoji ಠ_ಠ  &gt; And in that circumstance, there's probably some way to change a global setting, somewhere in any given computing environment, so that entering those characters becomes the default behavior of your entire keyboard. (And I know there are a vast variety of international keyboards correspondingly keycap-labelled with those other languages' symbols.) But in the general case...?  Keyboard mappings. Your computer has many of them, at least one of which may be useful.  In code, it's often simply easier to type the full extended character entity sequence (my Stargate A is &amp;\#x0245;&amp;\#x030A; in HTML, for example), but in those rare cases where you need to type a particular character, learning how your operating system handles direct code point entry is a Good Thing™ (U+2122, [Letter-like Symbols](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf)).",™

t5_2qh3s,balarga,1383028231,"Young actresses are definitely given good roles, but I do question someone who is 22 years old, like Jennifer Lawrence was at the time of her win, being given the Best Actress award. And for the record, I like Jennifer Lawrence both as a person and as an actress. But, not to be ageist, as I am close to her age, but it just seems like a 22-year-old could never bring the same depth that comes from life experience as an older actress could to a role.   Then again, no one can play a 22-year-old, who has limited life experience, quite like a 22-year-old actress. So maybe we should just give young actors better roles. Older actresses struggle to find roles, but young actors are also getting screwed, pardon the expression. I struggle to think of well-known male actors under 30, let alone well-respected male actors. Josh Hutcherson? Robert Pattinson? Ansel Elgort's an up-and-comer. Maybe I'm just blanking, but the only other actors I can think of are TV actors. It seems like young male actors get relegated to Disney Channel shows and cheesy teen movies, and don't get juicy roles until they're at least 35.   Edit: Okay, I remembered the Hemsworth brothers (Chris is now 30 but was under 30 when *Thor* came out), but neither of them are on track to win an Oscar. Maybe because young men can so easily get starring roles in blockbuster action movies, they have no interest in serious fare until they get older?  Edit 2: Just remembered Henry Cavill, who was 30 when *Man of Steel* came out but under 30 when they filmed it so not sure if that counts. And Jesse Eisenberg, who is also now 30 but was under 30 when he was nominated for *The Social Network*. Which reminds me of Andrew Garfield, who is *also* now 30 (what is it with actors born in 1983) and who starred in the most recent Spiderman film (in which he was under 30) but who has not really become a big-name actor. So maybe I was just blanking earlier. Still, the vast majority of these young actors are known for superhero/action/fantasy films, not Serious Oscar Fare™.",™

t5_2snuc,king_of_the_universe,1383032439,"In my model of God, the answer is kind of yes and kind of no. Explanation: When *you* think of God, you might have some basic properties in mind, like ""He can think about stuff, can make plans, remembers what he did before his last and second to last (etc.) action. Kinda like a human, but Super™ in every aspect. And flawless."" - But my model is much different.  I break down even those aspects to simpler ones and to even more simpler ones. Until I have found the *most* basic being that could be called God and achieve all that we see here. Why? Because it seems like the reasonable thing to do. *If* I want to believe that a God exists, then I want to have a proper definition, I want to *understand* God as far as possible.  In my model, all those aspects like ""Thinks, makes plans, etc."" could be part of him only if he wishes that, but they would not be the *true* God, they would be *made-up*. What remains if I disassemble him completely is: A circle of awareness. The awareness is aware that it is aware that it is aware that it is aware ... - which can be summarized to be the experience of ""I exist!"" But there is no body, no feelings, no past, no exterior world, nothing. And *that* is the true God, *that* is the truth, everything else is made up. Except for the following, because it's necessary: This pure awareness-substance kind of has muscles, it can *shape* itself. Now imagine you were pure awareness substance running in a circle, hence perceiving that there is perception which is perceiving and so forth, and all of that is you - but there would suddenly be a dent in the circle. This would give you a different experience. Awareness would suddenly have a definition, a sound, there would be *more* than just ""I exist"".  In this fashion, he can start a dream-dance, maybe literally like a circular oscilloscope. Like [this](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/qQF7Le1bZbc/maxresdefault.jpg), except running in a circle. That is what I think God's soul, all of existence, might quite literally look like.  Now, the moment the mind has twisted itself like this, it works differently, because perception itself has changed. The dreamer and the dream are one. It could even go so far to dream up a universe with billions of perceivers who are all really this one perceiver. An illusion game. But God does not dream indefinitely. And when he wakes up, seeing through the illusion, eventually only the perfectly round circle remains: ""I am!"" - And in that situation, even all mind-shape is dispelled. Hence there is no memory or aspiration etc., it's all gone. But the important part is: This circle, this mind, is all of existence, so when the circle has gone flat again, it's not just an illusion of his mind that there is no past or future. It's *fact*.  That might seem impossible, but it's not that hard to grasp: You have to think in hierarchies. Just like science discovers rules about reality and then tries to find the rules that, in turn, underlie *those* rules, until the one equation is found that governs the universe. If you look at that equation, you see the potential for everything universe, but you see no individual asteroids or lifeforms. In that way, once God wakes up and realizes the truth about himself, the total potential for everything, nothing *but* this potential is seen by his mind, and hence nothing but it *exists*.  This also solves the eternity problem: Every dream is the first dream. The ""I am.""-situation contains the potential for *all* possible dreams. What did God do before making the universe? Nothing. It was the first thing he ever did.",™

It wasn't the worst pain I've ever felt by a long shot, but it was up there. More so because you know it's coming and anticipate the pain. I haven't gotten any genital piercings since then, but mostly because there aren't many left to get. There is no ""right"" piercing to start with.  -My girlfriend loves the apadravra and the transscrotal (which acts like a pendulum and hits her *juuuuuuust* right in certain positions). She does *not* like the frenum piercings, because those cause significant discomfort. I removed one frenum piercing and the beading because they were significantly uncomfortable for my wife. I don't wear jewelry in the deep PA very often (It's a very old piercing, and it's never going to close), so that's never been an issue. As I'd said before, the sensation became my new baseline; it's normal for me now, so I'm not getting much added benefit. As far as reactions go, I can't tell you much; it's going to depend on your partner. Here's the important takeaway: **everyone is different**. Some owners will love them, some won't, some partners will like all piercings, some partners will like some piercings, and some won't like any.   FWIW, I *do* have highly visible tattoo work, and 15 visible facial piercings (incl. 1"" earlobes) so it's not exactly an enormous shock.  -Scarring has been weird. I didn't have any significant scarring from removing the Teflon® beads. I have some fairly significant scarring from the deep PA; that was scalpelled directly to 0 gauge, didn't work wonderfully well (even titanium jewelry is too heavy for a new piercing at that gauge), got removed, and is still open at 4 or 2 gauge over a decade later. The frenum piercings are a mixed bag; some have closed up completely and are just two small indentations, while two are partially open years later. Personally, scars don't bother me, and it's not like too many people are going to be carefully studying your penis to memorize every single detail. If I didn't point out the scarring, no one would ever know it was there.  ",®

That move came after the company that produced sodium thiopental had bowed to European Union pressure to stop making the drug, creating a shortage. The death penalty has been abolished in all EU nations.  &gt;The sodium thiopental shortage forced U.S. states to switch to pentobarbital.  &gt;Seven states currently use pentobarbital alone for executions and more are planning to use it, according to Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit organization that provides information on capital punishment. Other states use it as part of the three-stage execution process.  &gt;Pentobarbital also is commonly used during surgeries and by veterinarians to euthanize animals.  &gt;""Given it's used by veterinarians and on humans for other purposes, there's probably a lot out there. But if you have to make a new order, it's hard to get for prisons,"" Dieter said. Danish manufacturer Lundbeck and its American subsidiary, Akorn, are controlling the distribution of pentobarbital ""and are not allowing its distribution if it is to be used for executions,"" Dieter said.    The military has it's own manufacturing plants to produce ammunition. I don't understand why states can't manufacture their own pentobarbital or sodium thiopental . Is it some kind of patent issue? [Wikipedia says pentobarbital was first produced in 1928](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital) doesn't it seem like the patent would have run out by now? [Wikipedia cites 1939 and 1959 for the patent on sodium thiopental.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiopental)   [This article from 2010 says](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/us/30drug.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) ""Hospira Inc., the only domestic manufacturer of thiopental sodium, suspended production of the drug almost a year ago because of problems obtaining its active ingredient, which is supplied by another company, according to Daniel M. Rosenberg, a company spokesman. The firm, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill., hopes to resume production in the first quarter of 2011, he said.""  2011 Hospira Statement Regarding Pentothal™ (sodium thiopental) Market Exit  http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=175550&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1518610&amp;highlight   Hospira had intended to produce Pentothal at its Italian plant. In the last month, we've had ongoing dialogue with the Italian authorities concerning the use of Pentothal in capital punishment procedures in the United States – a use Hospira has never condoned.  Italy's intent is that we control the product all the way to the ultimate end user to prevent use in capital punishment.  These discussions and internal deliberation, as well as conversations with wholesalers - the primary distributors of the product to customers - led us to believe we could not prevent the drug from being diverted to departments of corrections for use in capital punishment procedures.  Based on this understanding, we cannot take the risk that we will be held liable by the Italian authorities if the product is diverted for use in capital punishment. Exposing our employees or facilities to liability is not a risk we are prepared to take.  Given the issues surrounding the product, including the government's requirements and challenges bringing the drug back to market, Hospira has decided to exit the market. We regret that issues outside of our control forced Hospira's decision to exit the market, and that our many hospital customers who use the drug for its well-established medical benefits will not be able to obtain the product from Hospira.

t5_2ya42,funkless_eck,1383054765,"##PART SIX  **NO-ONE** is reading this far, so I'm just going to say, please skim-read to the parts below where he says he is against contraception, and advocates domestic violence. Highlighted in bold.   &gt;*I personally blame the average woman’s complete disconnect from reality, owing in part to two realities of sex and biology. Women are the gatekeepers of sex; exempting rape, sex never happens unless the woman wants it to happen. Western dating and marriage culture is organized around this reality; in most cases, men are the ones who ask women out on dates and propose marriage. Additionally, womens’ sexual power peaks long before mens’ does. Because men find youth and beauty attractive, starting in her teen years, a reasonably attractive and sociable young woman can just sit back and watch the gentleman callers line up to kiss her feet. Not until her late twenties (give or take a few years depending on race and/or nationality) does her sexual power begin to wane. In contrast, no one but female pedophiles like Debra Lafave consider teenage boys to be desirable over all other age groups. Most men don’t begin to hit the peak of their sexual power until their mid- to late twenties, when they’ve established themselves in their careers and matured a little.* **This is why, despite feminist propaganda, most intergenerational relationships and marriages consist of an older man and a younger woman, not the other way around. Because of these factors, Western women can spend a good portion of their lives sailing on a cloud of fantasy**.  &gt;*Not only that, what Heartiste terms the “Four Sirens of the Sexual Apocalypse,” the four great social and technological changes that have* **enabled unrestrained female hypergamy (the desire for men at the top of the socioeconomic food chain to the exclusion of everyone else), also enable female solipsism**. *These Sirens are:*  &gt;**Effective, cheap, legal and widely available contraception (condoms, birth control pills, abortion). No-fault divorce. Economic emancipation for women (letting them go to college and join the workforce).** **Feminist-created laws like the Violence Against Women Act and child support laws that encourage women to divorce their husbands.** **The Sirens enable female solipsism by shielding women from the consequences of their bad behavior. Cheap and freely available contraception, for example, removes most of the ill effects of being a slut. In the not-too-distant past, sexual promiscuity was a recipe for social censure and life-threatening diseases. No-fault divorce makes getting out of a marriage as easy as getting in for wives, with alimony and child support sweetening the deal. In the past, women were cautioned against these actions by their mothers and grandmothers; this knowledge was junked in the sexual revolution in favor of the “if it feels good, do it” mantra of liberalism. Think of a spoiled brat who has everything he wants handed to him without complaint (lest he throw a tantrum) and who is rescued by daddy whenever he gets himself into trouble. In our modern world, women are basically spoiled children, constantly running to Daddy Government in tears whenever their stupid choices blow up in their faces.**  &gt;*As I stated earlier, men aren’t immune to being solipsistic, but on average they are less self-absorbed then women for the aforementioned reasons. We men are forced to confront reality from the outset because we are the dominant sex, expected to approach girls and direct our relationships with them. The overwhelming majority of guys have been slapped with rejections from girls from the day they first worked up the nerve to ask one out to the prom, forcing them to analyze their behaviors in order to either adapt to the sexual marketplace or drop out entirely in a world of video games and porn. The only men who can afford to engage in woman-esque solipsism without becoming late-night show punchlines are famous, wealthy or otherwise natural ladykillers – the rest of us grinders have to stay on our toes at all times.*  &gt;*Another factor in female sexual solipsism is how sexual promiscuity affects the minds of women. A comment from a now-defunct blog states this:*  &gt;*That may or may not be true: most slutty women I know could take on entire football teams without noticing the nature of male sexuality. They’re that self absorbed in their emotional turmoil, they don’t notice men look at them like a hungry man looks at a piece of meat. Prudes notice more, probably because they had fathers who were decent men.*  &gt;*The sexual double standard arises from the reality that getting sex is easy for women but hard for men. Women being the gatekeepers of sex, the reason studs are respected and sluts are derided is because being a stud requires skill, while being a slut merely requires a pulse and a lack of impulse control. As the folk saying goes, a key that can open many locks is a master key; a lock that can be opened by many keys is a faulty lock.*  &gt;*The unsung flip side of the double standard, however, is that female virgins are cherished whereas male virgins are ridiculed. A man who can’t get laid signals to the world that he is a loser who repels girls, while a woman who resists spreading her legs for every scumbag who winks at her signals that she is a sober, selective person. Because women can get laid easily but have a much harder time wrangling commitment out of a man in the form of marriage or a long-term relationship, women who cannot or will not stay in a relationship are poor sources of information on men. The male virgin and the female slut are mirror images of each other in terms of attractiveness to and knowledge of the opposite sex.*  &gt;***The solipsism of the fairer sex will ultimately be their undoing***. *The social conditions that have empowered women are on the verge of collapse. The article “The Misandry Bubble” from The Futurist blog names the “Four Horsemen of Male Emancipation,” four factors that will ensure the destruction of feminism by the end of this decade:*  &gt;*Game, the art of seduction, teaching men **how to manipulate female psychology to their advantage in the mating dance**.*  &gt;*Adult entertainment technological such as virtual reality sex simulators,* **allowing men to have sex without the hassle of having to seduce an actual woman.**  &gt;*Globalization, which encompasses* **the expatriation of Western men to non-feminist countries outside the West** *as well as* **immigration from those same countries to Western countries, weakening popular support for feminism.**  &gt;*Male economic disengagement due to the poor economy and progressive taxation that benefits women at the expense of men. Even with our current “mancession,” men still dominate job fields that are necessary to keep the economy going, such as construction, manufacturing, mining, law enforcement and the military; women dominate ancillary fields such as education, healthcare, and the civil service. The latter needs the former to function, but the former doesn’t need the latter.*  &gt;*Coupled with how women typically desire marriage more than men and womens’ hypergamous mating preferences, this is going to lead to a massive shift of power in the mating market from women to men. The Futurist terms the moment when a woman realizes her sexual power has fallen off a cliff the “Wile E. Coyote Moment”:*  &gt;*…In the past, the steady hand of a young woman’s mother and grandmother knew that her beauty was temporary, and that the most seductive man was not the best husband, and they made sure that the girl was married off to a boy with long-term durability. Now that this guidance has been removed from the lives of young women, thanks to ‘feminism’,* **these women are proving to be poor pilots of their mating lives who pursue alpha males until the age of 34-36 when her desirability drops precipitously** *and not even beta males she used to reject are interested in her. This stunning plunge in her prospects with men is known as the Wile E. Coyote moment, and* **women of yesteryear had many safety nets that protected them from this fate**. *The ‘feminist’ media’s attempt to normalize ‘cougarhood’ is evidence of gasping desperation to package failure as a desirable outcome, which will never become mainstream due to sheer biological realities…*  &gt;***The big irony is that ‘feminism’, rather than improving the lives of women, has stripped away the safety nets of mother/grandmother guidance that would have shielded her from ever having to face her Wile E. Coyote moment. ‘Feminism’ has thus put the average woman at risk in yet another area.***  &gt;***With the coming economic meltdown and the end of the “sheconomy,” a great many Strong, Independent Women™ are going to find themselves up Shit Creek without a paddle.*** *While marriage served the function of keeping good women out of total poverty in the past, the current generation of men will be too burned out by feminism to play Captain Save-a-Ho this time around. In the war between the sexes,* ***the ultimate losers will be women, not men.***  In short - let's form a patriarchal conspiracy, chums! ",™

t5_2rw7o,brdtwrk,1383067581,"&gt; **Prevention Is Key**  &gt; The best way to ensure that your dog never gets in the habit of stealing food is to prevent him from experiencing the joys of thieving. Always put leftover foods away. Keep countertop foods in Tupperware® containers. Put pastries and breads in a bread bin and cookies in a jar. Fruits and raw vegetables are less appealing to many dogs, but it’s still worth keeping them in or on top of the refrigerator. Use trash cans with lids that dogs can’t open, or keep the can in a closed cupboard. Place wastebaskets up high so that your dog can’t reach them. If your dog has learned to open cupboard doors, install child-proof latches. Close doors or use baby gates to keep your dog out of certain areas. If you’re consistent about keeping foods inaccessible when your dog is a puppy or is new to your home, you can probably relax these restrictions later on.  - More tips for preventing counter-surfing at [Counter Surfing and Garbage Raiding](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/counter-surfing-and-garbage-raiding) | ASPCA  And for crate problems:  - [Weekend Crate Training](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/weekend-crate-training) | ASPCA",®

t5_2qhn3,bunchareality,1383070404,"Protective essential oil attenuates influenza virus infection: an in vitro study in MDCK cells.  *BMC Complement Altern Med. 2010 Nov 15;10:69.;   Wu S, Patel KB, Booth LJ, Metcalf JP, Lin HK, Wu W.;  Department of Respiratory Medicine, the first Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, PR China.*  Abstract  BACKGROUND:  Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The recent pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza virus has stressed the importance of the search for effective treatments for this disease. Essential oils from aromatic plants have been used for a wide variety of applications, such as personal hygiene, therapeutic massage and even medical practice. In this paper, we investigate the potential role of an essential oil in antiviral activity.  METHODS:  We studied a commercial essential oil blend, On Guard™, and evaluated its ability in modulating influenza virus, A/PR8/34 (PR8), infection in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Influenza virus was first incubated with the essential oil and infectivity in MDCK cells was quantified by fluorescent focus assay (FFA). In order to determine the mechanism of effects of essential oil in viral infection inhibition, we measured hemagglutination (HA) activity, binding and internalization of untreated and oil-treated virus in MDCK cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, the effect of oil treatment on viral transcription and translation were assayed by relative end-point RT-PCR and western blot analysis.  RESULTS:  Influenza virus infectivity was suppressed by essential oil treatment in a dose-dependent manner; the number of nascent viral particles released from MDCK cells was reduced by 90% and by 40% when virus was treated with 1:4,000 and 1:6,000 dilutions of the oil, respectively. Oil treatment of the virus also decreased direct infection of the cells as the number of infected MDCK cells decreased by 90% and 45% when virus was treated with 1:2,000 and 1:3,000 dilutions of the oil, respectively. This was not due to a decrease in HA activity, as HA was preserved despite oil treatment. In addition, oil treatment did not affect virus binding or internalization in MDCK cells. These effects did not appear to be due to cytotoxicity of the oil as MDCK cell viability was only seen with concentrations of oil that were 2 to 6 times greater than the doses that inhibited viral infectivity. RT-PCR and western blotting demonstrated that oil treatment of the virus inhibited viral NP and NS1 protein, but not mRNA expression.  CONCLUSIONS:  **An essential oil blend significantly attenuates influenza virus PR8 infectivity in vitro without affecting viral binding or cellular internalization in MDCK cells. Oil treated virus continued to express viral mRNAs but had minimal expression of viral proteins, suggesting that the antiviral effect may be due to inhibition of viral protein translation.**       Melaleuca Essential Oil Antiviral Effects  Letters in Applied Microbiology, Volume 49 Issue 6  Abstract  Aims:  To investigate the in vitro antiviral activity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil (TTO) and its main components, terpinen-4-ol, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, p-cymene, terpinolene and α-terpineol.  Methods and Results:  The antiviral activity of tested compounds was evaluated against polio type 1, ECHO 9, Coxsackie B1, adeno type 2, herpes simplex (HSV) type 1 and 2 viruses by 50% plaque reduction assay. The anti-influenza virus assay was based on the inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathogenicity. Results obtained from our screening demonstrated that the TTO and some of its components (the terpinen-4-ol, the terpinolene, the α-terpineol) have an inhibitory effect on influenza A/PR/8 virus subtype H1N1 replication at doses below the cytotoxic dose. The ID50 value of the TTO was found to be 0·0006% (v/v) and was much lower than its CD50 (0·025% v/v). All the compounds were ineffective against polio 1, adeno 2, ECHO 9, Coxsackie B1, HSV-1 and HSV-2. None of the tested compounds showed virucidal activity. Only a slight virucidal effect was observed for TTO (0·125% v/v) against HSV-1 and HSV-2.  Conclusions:  **These data show that TTO has an antiviral activity against influenza** A/PR/8 virus subtype H1N1 **and that antiviral activity has been principally attributed to terpinen-4-ol, the main active component.**  Significance and Impact of the Study:  TTO should be a promising drug in the treatment of influenza virus infection.     Chemical composition and larvicidal evaluation of Mentha, Salvia, and Melissa essential oils against the West Nile virus mosquito Culex pipiens.  Parasitol Res. 2010 Jul;107(2):327-35. Epub 2010 Apr 20;   Koliopoulos G, Pitarokili D, Kioulos E, Michaelakis A, Tzakou O.;   Laboratory of Insecticides of Public Health Importance, Benaki Phytopathological Institute, 8 S. Delta str. 14561 Kifissia, Athens, Greece.  Abstract  The volatile metabolites of wild-growing Mentha spicata, M. longifolia, M. suaveolens, Melissa officinalis, Salvia fruticosa, S. pomifera subsp. calycina, and S. pomifera subsp. pomifera from Greece were determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The insecticidal properties of the analyzed essential oils were screened on Culex pipiens larvae. Additionally two of the main components of the essential oils, piperitenone oxide and 1,8-cineole were assayed against C. pipiens in order to define the affiliation between them and the larvicidal properties of the oils. The most effective oils were M. suaveolens (major constituent piperitenone oxide, 62.4%), M. spicata (piperitenone oxide, 35.7% and 1,8-cineole, 14.5%) and M. longifolia--Central Greece (piperitenone oxide, 33.4%; 1,8-cineole, 24.5% and trans-piperitone epoxide, 17.4%), which exhibited LC(50) values ranging from 47.88 to 59.33 mg l(-1). Medium activity revealed the oils of M. officinalis (terpin-4-ol, 15.8%; caryophyllene oxide, 13.2%; sabinene, 12.9%; beta-pinene, 12.1%; and trans-caryophyllene, 10.2%), M. longifolia--Southern Greece (carvone, 54.7% and limonene 20.0%), S. pomifera subsp. pomifera (trans-caryophyllene, 22.5% and trans-thujone, 21.0%), S. pomifera subsp. calycina--West Southern Greece (trans-thujone, 56.1% and 1,8-cineole, 10.4%), and S. fruticosa--population 2 (camphor, 23.1%; alpha-pinene, 12.7%; and borneol, 12.6%), with LC(50) values ranging from 78.28 to 91.45 mg l(-1). S. pomifera subsp. calycina (Central Greece) essential oil (trans-thujone, 26.5% and cis-thujone, 12.0%) presented rather low activity (LC(50) values 140.42 mg l(-1)), while S. fruticosa--population 1 (1,8-cineole, 31.4% and camphor, 22.6%) was the only inactive oil. Additionally, the constituent piperitenone oxide was found to be highly active (LC(50) values 9.95 mg l(-1)), whereas 1,8-cineole revealed no toxicity.     High quality Bergamot oil from Greece: Chemical analysis using chiral gas chromatography and larvicidal activity against the West Nile virus vector.  Molecules. 2009 Feb 18;14(2):839-49;   Melliou E, Michaelakis A, Koliopoulos G, Skaltsounis AL, Magiatis P.;   Department of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis-Zografou, Greece. emelliou@pharm.uoa.gr  Abstract  Tauhe essential oils contained in the rind of the fruit and the leaves of Bergamot from Greece (Citrus aurantium subsp. bergamia) were studied. The Bergamot trees in question were cultivated on Kefalonia Island. The plant material (leaves and fruits in different stages of maturity) was collected between December and March for a two year period. The rind of the fruit was separated manually and the essential oil was obtained either by cold pressing or by hydrodistillation. The maximum yield calculated on a wet weight of fresh rinds basis was 1.8%. The essential oils were first analyzed by GC-MS with a DB-5 column and then with a beta-Dex enantiomeric column. The main constituent of the cold pressed essential oil of the rind was (-)-linalyl acetate with optical purity &gt;99.9%. Other important constituents were (-)-linalool, (+)-limonene and gamma-terpinene. The best value of linalool/linalyl acetate ratio was 0.38 and the maximum sum of linalool+linalyl acetate was found to be 55.8%. The larvacidal activities of the obtained essential oils and the compounds (+/-)-linalyl acetate, (+/-)-linalool and (-)-linalool were evaluated against larvae of the mosquito species Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae), the West Nile virus vector, under laboratory conditions. The cold pressed essential oil showed an LC(50) value of 58 mg/L, while the LC(50) value of the corresponding essential oil obtained by hydrostillation was 106 mg/L. The essential oil of the leaves presented similar larvicidal toxicity with the cold pressed oil of the rind (LC(50)=68 mg/L).  **[Source](http://www.everythingessential.me/HealthConcerns/Flu.html#page=page-2)**",™

t5_2qh3v,teebalicious,1383074301,"Thanks, I have indeed :)  It's hard, our gun culture is so extreme, but the views of most pro-gun control Americans are very moderate. When asked, my real political stance is that I just want us to stop shooting each other. If we truly had a nation of Responsible Gun Owners™, I wouldn't bat an eye at gun ownership.  No Yanks that I know of - even quite passionate gun control advocates - are even considering UK or Australian levels of gun law reform, yet the pushback is so virulent. It is the deepest irony that the behavior of gun owners themselves shows exactly why it is so important to get guns out of their hands.",™

t5_2vizz,Celot,1383083224,"Ableism is actually a real issue™. The problem is that it's rarely black and white.  The way I define a real issue™ is an issue that will influence a person's day to day life in a significant manner. If you have mobility issues, you may not have a great choice in terms of apartment. This is sometimes more of an issue, sometimes it's not. However, it really comes into play in a job market. Let's say you're interviewing someone with a good resume, but the person has a speech impediment. You're going to be a lot less likely to hire that person even if they are equally well-qualified. The question comes down to ""is this right?"" and it really depends. If they're a telemarketer, then maybe the speech impediment would be a determent.  If it's office financial matters, then is that really fair? It's a hard question because there will be a hurdle to communication, but it's not fair to skip over this person just because they were born with a speech impediment.",™

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1383085161,"The testing isn't all that exhaustive. See my critique of the GMO version of 90-day rodent toxicity studies. Additionally, while you certainly can't prove (or even hope to find definitive evidence) that GMOs might have non-monotonic dose response curves by using the current crop of GMO studies approved by the industry (""approved"" as in the authors weren't fired, physically threatened, or had their research institute threatened with loss of funds), there's at least some indications (in my mind at least) that the GMO companies are aware of possible EDC issues and have worked hard to conceal them from the scientific and consumer community:  In Monsanto's studies, if a test shows significance in the middle of the study, but not at the end, even if the test is significant when comparing to the control group AND when comparing to the 6 pooled reference groups, the test is counted as ""not significant for purposes of this study"" or words to that effect.  This is based on the standard ""dose makes the poison"" view of chemical toxicity. However, it is well-known that endocrine-disruptors can have far more complicated dose-response curves, and the very quality that allows Monsanto to assert that they can dismiss such a test (that it only shows a mid-term difference, and not an end-of-study difference) also happens to be a sign of an endocrine disrupting substance.   The fact that BOTH tests show a significant difference may well be, well, significant, or that's how I read the literature on the topic. Of course, perhaps none of the tests worked as I suggest, and even if they did, perhaps it was all random fluctuation, as Monsanto implicitly asserts, but in a standard toxicity study, one doesn't assume such things, but does further research as needed. No GMO rodent toxicity study that I am aware of, other than Seralini's, has ever suggested ""more research needed.""   [Results of a 13 week safety assurance study with rats fed grain from glyphosate tolerant corn](http://gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hammond2004.pdf) &gt;Clinical pathology parameters were generally com- parable for all groups. There were a few statistically significant differences between the Roundup Ready groups and the control groups after 4 weeks and at study termination (urinalysis). _These differences were not considered to be test article related_ since they were within the mean +-2 standard deviations of the population of reference controls, were different from one control group but not the other, were sometimes not dose related (observed at the low dose but not the high dose), and/or occurred after 4 weeks but not at study termination.  [Below I quoted one of the standard texts of toxicology to show that using the reference group as the final justification for ignoring significant differences is considered Really Bad™ by real toxicologists](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1p6cji/need_some_data_on_why_arguments_for_long_term/cd1evbu), but this is the standard used in all GMO rodent toxicity studies.

t5_2qqjc,thekeeper228,1383089380,"Nonsense.  No one even knew if the atomic bomb would work in 1944.  A naughty document'  Portrait of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin Portrait of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin  © These additional sources often reveal more than the official minutes were willing to record. On a visit to Moscow in October 1944, Churchill suggested to Stalin that between them they should discuss the division of Europe at the end of the war.  Churchill jotted down some suggestions which he handed to Stalin saying: 'This is rather a naughty document. The Americans would be shocked if they saw how crudely I have put this.'  While details of this meeting are recorded in the official minutes, as well as in Churchill's own volumes on the history of World War Two, this particular attempt by the prime minister to appeal to Stalin's ruthless nature was only recorded in notes of the meeting made by the British ambassador in Moscow.  Notes of meetings can also reveal information that other sources such as photographs fail to provide. Take the moment in August 1939 when the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact between the Nazis and the Soviets was caught on camera. Just before the picture was taken, Stalin and the two foreign ministers, Joachim von Ribbentrop and Vyacheslav Molotov, celebrated with a drink.  Source - BBC.",©

You may have to do a little extra cleaning and endure a bit of smell, but as far as cost goes I have resorted to buying crickets in bulk from a cricket farm (Fluker's, Armstrong's Crickets, Georgia Crickets, etc...).  You can get 5 times the amount for the same price as you would pay at the pet store and it also saves on gas.  It's a bit if a pain in the heinie, but I've found that if you keep them in a well ventilated container (aquarium w/ screen cover or a large Rubbermaid tote with a ton of holes drilled into the lid) and sweep the waste out of it daily, it doesn't smell too bad.

t5_2ss5b,chaoser,1383104057,"It actually decreases risk for infections and cancer  &gt;POTENTIAL BENEFITS — Circumcision has been associated with a number of medical benefits, including lower rates of urinary tract infection (UTI), penile cancer, penile inflammation, penile dermatoses, and sexually transmitted infections [18,19]. A lower rate of UTI is the major benefit during infancy.  &gt;In the uncircumcised male, the preputial space provides a warm moist environment that both traps pathogens and bodily secretions and is favorable to their survival and replication, while the foreskin itself is susceptible to microabrasions that are thought to facilitate acquisition and transmission of infection. In contrast, the keratinized glans of the circumcised male is thought to create an unfavorable environment for these processes  While risks are low:  &gt;Procedure related complications — An accurate complication rate is difficult to determine, as the largest studies are retrospective and based on coding diagnoses and inconsistent definitions. In addition, data have generally not been stratified to account for timing of the procedure, technique, provider type, setting, length of follow-up, timing of complications, and severity of complications.  &gt;In two studies that included a total of over 200,000 circumcisions performed in US hospitals, the rate of complications during and in the first month after the procedure was approximately 0.2 percent [35,36].  &gt;A systematic review identified 16 prospective studies of complications following neonatal and infant circumcision by a variety of providers from 12 countries and primarily using the Plastibell [77]. The median frequency of any adverse event was 1.5 percent (range 0 to 16 percent) and the median frequency of any serious adverse event was 0 percent (range 0 to 2 percent); nine studies reported no serious adverse events, but three studies reported that 1 to 2 percent of boys had a serious complication. Complication rates were slightly lower in 10 retrospective studies.  Here are some opinons from both professional and lay groups:  &gt;OPINIONS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND GROUPS — Professional societies and lay groups have expressed a wide range of views concerning the advantages and disadvantages of routine circumcision. Several pediatric and urologic experts feel that circumcision should be advocated as a prophylactic public health measure [13,93,99-103], and there is increasing commentary from the pediatric literature suggesting that male circumcision may be an effective prophylactic intervention for disease prevention in the United States and other countries [104,105]. On the other hand, small, but vocal, groups have proposed the theory that all men who are circumcised may be emotionally harmed, but are unable to recognize their feelings. Other groups oppose circumcision on a human rights basis, saying the infant is not allowed to decide whether or not he wants to be circumcised and the procedure constitutes genital mutilation [101]. In 2012, a German court in Cologne ruled that circumcising young boys represents grievous bodily harm, but was overruled by a higher court. Still others believe the procedure decreases sexual pleasure [79].  &gt;In 1996, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) issued a clinical practice guideline which stated, ""The overall evidence of the benefits and harms of circumcision is so evenly balanced that it does not support recommending circumcision as a routine procedure for newborns"" [106].  &gt;In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) task force on circumcision of the male infant concluded that ""the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks; furthermore, the benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits from male circumcision were identified for the prevention of urinary tract infections, acquisition of HIV, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer. Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction” [107]. Compared to their previous statement, this statement is a stronger affirmation of the health benefits of circumcision. However, the AAP did not recommend routine circumcision. They said “Parents should weigh the health benefits and risks in light of their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences, as the medical benefits alone may not outweigh these other considerations for individual families” [107].  &gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) endorsed the conclusions of the AAP discussed above [108].  &gt;In 2012, the American Urological Association (AUA) reaffirmed their 2007 policy that stated, “The American Urological Association, Inc® (AUA) believes that neonatal circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and risks… is generally a safe procedure when performed by an experienced operator… When circumcision is being discussed with parents and informed consent obtained, medical benefits and risks, and ethnic, cultural, religious and individual preferences should be considered. The risks and disadvantages of circumcision are encountered early whereas the advantages and benefits are prospective” [109].  &gt;In addition, as discussed above (see 'HIV infection' above), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that male circumcision be considered as part of a comprehensive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention package in Africa and other countries with high HIV prevalence and low rates of male circumcision [55]. They stated that a human rights-based approach to promotion of male circumcision requires measures that ensure that the procedure be carried out safely, with informed consent, and without coercion or discrimination, and have published guidance for providing these services [110].  All of this is from uptodate which is basically the professional online database for medical professionals",®

We walked to the service desk so she could use a phone to call someone, as I'm not allowed to pulling out during hours. She started checking pockets and there it was. I turned off my register light and insisted on carrying her groceries out, as it was dark, really late and rainy. Plus, I saw she had a cane. I loaded up her car and had her sit where it was dry. All she could say was, i didnt think stores did this anymore. Well, I DO! She's the sweetest lady I've had the pleasure to help yet.

t5_2rdsb,SlippedNFellOnDaDick,1383118016,"Just wanted to give you a few words of encouragement :) I grew up being force-fed a certain religion...after I made it into adulthood it made me wary of seeking and/or believing in a higher power...honestly I think I thought that *I* was the highest power...like I was undefeatable or something (ignorant like that). Long story short, I have that higher power now. Don't let anyone ""force"" you into finding your higher power or tell you what your higher power has to be. It doesn't even have to be a religion - everyone has a different perspective on what a higher power *is* exactly - and that's what makes us all unique - we're not walking, talking robots that are controlled under any circumstance. Regardless of if/what you choose a higher power, it shouldn't ""control"" you. A true higher power allows you free will and you will live every day happily knowing that *you* were free to make your decisions today and today you made good ones :) That is how I look at having a higher power...just remember, you are your own person and you can only ""truly"" do something when *you* are ready *and* willing to do it...good, bad, or ugly...I never live in regret, I just learn from my mistakes...and sometimes it takes me a few good whacks on the head before I wake up and say ""What the WHAT?!"" and get my mind right again - I accept that and for me, that's okay :) ♥ GL to you in your quest...if you ever wanna chat, HMU :) ",♥

t5_2qh3l,senshisentou,1383148977,"I completely agree with you on your first point. I am curious however if there is any reason to believe GMOs may cause long-term effects. Have we even done such a study for, say, coffee or tea? Or another popular one, gluten? What makes GMOs inherently different?  As for point two, I disagree. Imagine someone less educated doing groceries and finding ""Senshis™"", a new kind of small banana-chocolate pancakes. They think to themselves ""ooh, this looks interesting! Wonder what goes in it?"". This could be due to pure interest, or perhaps they have some kind of allergy. They read the ingredients and find ""contrains genetically modified sugar and vanilla extract."" It's not too farfetched to imagine their thought process going as follows: ""Genetically modified? That sounds a bit scary, what in the world are they doing now? In my days we just grew stuff normally. Well, guess it's unhealthy though; *why else would they put it on there?*""  So yes, I do believe it will scare and confuse a significant amount of people. I think it's safe to assume that almost all food sold in supermarkets contains some kind of GMO ingredient, unless it's specifically stated otherwise. I'm fine(ish) with companies telling people whether it contains GMOs or not, whether on their sites or their packages, that's their choice. But to make this mandatory is, imho, a wrong move to make.  *Note: GMO in this comment refers to the ""scary, sciency"" kind only.",™

This post is great, and although I'm another Certified Cicerone® I don't have much to add. Except maybe look at the Level 2 cost as $500 all-in, and include the off-flavor tasting seminar / kit as part of your cost. Without that, I wouldn't have passed the tasting, and even with a written pass I probably would have been discouraged from re-trying.  Professionally speaking it's been a great addition to the resume and has definitely unlocked a lot of doors. Now, bear in mind, those doors would still be locked if I didn't have other experience, but the knowledge itself is a nice marketing point. Also in the course of study I learned a lot more about draught systems than I had ever been familiar with.  Net positive, go for it.

t5_2rtvz,Mike_The_Moose,1383151573,"Even if you discard the action/inaction difference between the situations♦ and predispose both decisions to positive action. I think the position you are overlooking is this. At end of life, if the person wants to keep fighting for life, **we let them,** and never promote saying as a third party that their life is not worth anything to *us* or their life *shouldn't* be worth anything to them, and therefore we should end it. The justification in case of the person being unable to speak for themselves is, I *know* this person, I have *known* this person in life for some time, I *love* this person, and I *know*, this is what *they* would want. Note the two provisions here.   1. You actually have the requisite practical experience with the person to know their mind and will. And can reasonably be expected to testify truthfully to it.   2. You have an attached interest of personal affection to *NOT* act in your or some other party's self interest above theirs.   Both of these are impossible bars to meet when procuring an abortion for any reason. You cannot presume to be able to speak authoritatively about the value of someone's life you don't know, because it is value to them that counts, not to us. A distinct difference between the two situations. ♦Still though remember the Church sees action/inaction very differently on these cases. And not wanting to continue living may be good reason to not continue life saving efforts for the terminally ill. Actually taking overt steps to kill the terminally ill is still a huge no-no for everyone involved, including the terminally ill.",♦

This Toronto Calgary game is super intriguing, that said I don't have a read on it any which way. I could justify any pick I make.   I'm gonna make a pick based on value here...**Tor/Cgy UNDER 5.5** ✘. Bernier is starting which I think leads me to Calgary scoring once or twice. Ramo is starting which leads me to the leafs getting 2-3 but the back to back leads me closer to 2...enough rambling yet?  Calgary is also now missing 2 offensive pieces in Giordano and Stempniak...  I'll make another value pick here...**Bos ML** ✘ not sure if I have a great feeling ether way here but i like Boston's level of consistency, you're always getting a solid effort. Being priced as an underdog, I'll take it.   **Wings ML**. ✔ Canucks are winners of 4 straight but were pushing our luck just a wee bit. If we don't lose tonight we'll get killed on Bure night, but for now I'll play the wings.   **SJ/LA 3-way regulation tie**. ✔ These are two teams with good qualities and good records.

The website is mostly selling a subset of gear from one shitty company, SHS® International, with many shitty brands of shitty chinese gear.  If you remove all of the SHS products, there would be almost no gear at all on the website.  It looks like it's a front for SHS.  This is not what professional music gear businesses sell.  The business must offer the brands that customers want.  SHS has zero brand recognition or value, and nothing about their products show any real innovation.  In fact, the products are a bad joke.  In addition, the website has major false claims about warranty coverage for SHS products.  It states ""5 years Waranty"" and ""What more assurance can you get from an amp manufacturer that uncoditional 5 years waranty on all their amps.""  Besides the terrible spelling and grammar, SHS doesn't warranty their amps for 5 years and the warranty isn't unconditional.  It's loaded with conditions.  What more assurance would I want?

Hearing a writer's viewpoint on the relationship is cool because it provides some context that I don't think we really had before.  When Red John first used the Tiger Tiger quote, we didn't have any understanding of why.  Hearing every other victim and suspect since then use the same quote (especially as their dying breath!) has been increasingly annoying.  But now in this interview, the perspective is shifting a little.  Instead of questions like, ""why are all these dudes using a Red John quote,"" now maybe it's more like, ""why did Red John tell Jane a secret society password?""",™

Ştiam că am mai răspuns odată la problema asta, aşa că dau paste mai jos ceea ce am zis mai demult. /bigger grammar nazi out  E o diferenţă fundamentală între a vroi şi a voi, iar faptul că tâmpiţii de la academie au scos din DOOM2 verbul a vroi nu înseamnă că el iese din limbajul uzual al multor români care *aşa au învăţat să vorbească pentru că atunci când au învăţat să vorbească era corect să foloseşti a vroi.*  *A voi*, conform [DEX 98](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/voi/21079) înseamnă   &gt;VOÍ2, voiesc, vb. IV. Tranz. 1. A fi hotărât, a fi decis să...; a avea de gând să..., a intenționa, a vrea. ♦ Intranz. (La imperativ) A avea voință neclintită, a stărui într-o acțiune. 2. A fi de acord, a consimți, a primi. [Prez. ind. și: voi] – Probabil din voie (derivat regresiv). – Cf. sl. voliti.  iar *a vroi*, conform [DEX 98](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/vroi/27394)  &gt;VROÍ vb. IV. v. vrea.   Dar, demult (Dicţionarul limbii româneşti 1939), verbele [vreau](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/vrea%C5%AD/752368) şi [voiesc](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/vo%C4%ADesc/752097) aveau definiţii comune, deşi este specificat că ""voiesc"" este o formă livrescă.   Când spui că ""voiam să *ceva*"", raportându-ne la definiţia actuală din dicţionar, se înţelege, pe lângă prima definiţie - cea echivalentă cu a vrea - că tu ai consimţit ca acea acţiune să se desfăşoare.   &gt;Ex: Eu voiam eliberarea deţinuţilor.  Adică eu îmi doream ca deţinuţii să fie eliberaţi şi dădeam ordinele care să înlesnească acest lucru.  Când foloseşti ""a vroi"", restrângi înţelesul doar la simpla acţiune de a dori un lucru.  &gt;Ex: Eu vroiam eliberarea deţinuţilor.  Eu îmi doream ca deţinuţii să fie eliberaţi.  Probabil că prin DOOM2 s-a încercat o simplificare a semnificaţiilor voi/vroi şi reducerea lor la o simplă formă. Lucrul ăsta e cel puţin ciudat, având în vedere alte inepţii care apar în corpul DOOM2, cum ar fi acceptarea echivalenţei între sintagmele ""cartea de pe masă"" şi ""cartea după masă"" sau, bineînţeles, întreaga confuzie creată de nicio/nici o.   După aproape 9 ani de la apariţia DOOM2, lucrurile sunt în continuare confuze. Problema, cred, stă în faptul că s-a încercat aplicarea unor reguli mult prea stricte care îngrădesc evoluţia naturală a limbii. N-am nimic împotrivă ca ""de pe/după"" să însemne acelaşi lucru dacă aşa ""se vorbeşte"" în mod corect româna. N-aş avea nimic împotrivă să se accepte echivalenţa între doar/decât având în vedere frecvenţa acestei greşeli.  După mine, dinamica limbii e ţinută prea din scurt de către Academie şi de către aprigii susţinători ai regulilor artificiale impuse aproape arbitrar. Dacă analizăm limbi precum Engleza, în care apar mereu noi împrumuturi din alte limbi şi noi cuvinte prin combinarea altora deja existente, limba noastră pare săracă şi limitată. Aşa şi e.  ",♦

t5_2tkqb,SanctumXVI,1383163217,"Before you read this, Im a Master Zerg, so Im not familiar with exact Protoss build orders.  That proxy hatch killed you.  The lack of the Zerg's ability to spend the money that he had in his bank is the reason you were able to make a comeback.  This all goes back to map awareness - noticing the drone enter your base is crucial.  It is very rare that I scout with a drone in ZvP (I never need to), so any drone should be a red flag.  Throw down a second gateway immediately if this happens again in the future.  Something I would have liked to have seen you do, and what would have saved you the third base, is more gateways/chargelots to defend your colossus and void ray army.  It is very fragile to a roach hydra army like you faced, and the zealots by the time/damage that you need to push him back.  Overall, I think you played very well from being so far behind.  I think your two focuses should be to increase your map awareness and make sure you're spending all the money you can (in this case, extra minerals on more gateways and zealots).  Good luck on ladder.  Cheers ♥",♥

t5_2ss5b,chaoser,1383170745,"I guess the AAP, ACOG, and AUA are all monstrous as well seeing as how offering that choice is a part of their guidelines  &gt;In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) task force on circumcision of the male infant concluded that ""the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks; furthermore, the benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits from male circumcision were identified for the prevention of urinary tract infections, acquisition of HIV, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer. Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction” [107]. Compared to their previous statement, this statement is a stronger affirmation of the health benefits of circumcision. However, the AAP did not recommend routine circumcision. They said “Parents should weigh the health benefits and risks in light of their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences, as the medical benefits alone may not outweigh these other considerations for individual families” [107].   &gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) endorsed the conclusions of the AAP discussed above [108].   &gt;In 2012, the American Urological Association (AUA) reaffirmed their 2007 policy that stated, “The American Urological Association, Inc® (AUA) believes that neonatal circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and risks… is generally a safe procedure when performed by an experienced operator… When circumcision is being discussed with parents and informed consent obtained, medical benefits and risks, and ethnic, cultural, religious and individual preferences should be considered. The risks and disadvantages of circumcision are encountered early whereas the advantages and benefits are prospective” [109]",®

t5_2tbbg,Lekor,1383174194,"Your skin works properly when certain conditions are met, one being that it is properly hydrated. Your ""super oily skin"" may be due to you irritating and drying out your skin with a combination of physical exfoliation, medications, and the cleanser, and the skin is trying to compensate for that lack of moisture by pumping out more oils to prevent further moisture loss.   Like I said previously, the Clarisonic Mia may have been used too often and perhaps is one of the causes of your oily skin.  So might the facial cleanser. The [Facial Cleansing Gel](http://www.hylunia.com/products/face-care/facial-cleansers/facial-cleansing-gel)'s ingredients list is really masking what the actual ingredients are: &gt;Organic Aloe Vera Extract, Propriety Surfactant Blend, Hyaluronic Acid (Plant derived), Sclerotium Gum (from straw), Citric Acid (from citrus fruits) and Anti-Microbial Complex™.   What does propriety surfactant blend, or Anti-Microbial Complex mean? There are certainly irritating surfactants out there like sodium lauryl sulfate, and botanical extracts that the Anti-Microbial Complex seems to be made of can also cause irritation (like citrus oils).   Of course, you do need the medications to control your acne, but if you believe that minocycline is not doing anything, discuss this with your doctor to get something different. And you definitely need to use sunscreen when using a topical retinoid, Epiduo is an adapalene and benzoyl peroxide combo.

What's your favorite band? (I always ask this to everyone I can so... yeah)  2. What do you consider the most beautiful thing about Earth or the Universe or basically where we all live?  And I know these are nos videogame related questions, but I think that even if you play a lot of games and do videos about that, well, you're still a person, and you have thoughts and opinions about the world (or at least I try to convince myself that you do). BY THE WAY HOLY SHIT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL OKAY LIKE WOW YOU'RE GORGEOUS. Ok done. I love you!! &lt;3",♥

t5_2s4m9,swindlerrzz,1383186255,"I can think of many aspects of male sexuality that are considered ""perverted"" or ""deviant"" by some people.  Off the top of my head all forms of androphilia are considered to be a deviation from Proper Male Sexuality™ by a pretty sizeable number of people despite it being a perfectly healthy, good expression of male sexuality. I'm sure that you are so upset about the stigma against men having sex with other men or with trans* people.  I can think of at least one thing that has never ever ever ever ever ever ever been considered a ""perverse"" expression of male sexuality and that's consensual sex with a woman. I'm going to a take a random shot in the dark and guess that you're a cis, hetero man so I ask you, what the fuck are you on about?  If you look across the spectrum of all male sexuality that exists, the vast majority of it in terms of number of types is probably considered ""perverted"" or ""deviant"" by the sundry shitty people of the world, but I doubt you give a damn about any of them.  You've narrowly defined ""male sexuality"" as your particular sexuality because your ignorant ass can't fathom the idea that there are people other than you in the world. And you're probably a fucking creep who's upset that women find you creepy, so you whine about how ""male sexuality"" is demonized because of feminists. ""A woman gave me a mean glare because my eyes were locked on her breasts. Such misandry. Don't have ~~large~~ ~~medium~~ breasts or not wear a burqa if you don't enjoy when I oggle you because then you're oppressing me by declaring that male sexuality is perverted""  Lots and lots of cis, hetero men are having no problems at all expressing their sexuality (contrasted with pretty much every other fucking person who does nearly all the time) but it's not because they followed ""Step 1: Be attractive Step 2: Don't be unattractive"" or because ""OMG girls don't like geeky stuff ;("" it's because they don't blame their lack of confidence and social skills on some feminist boogey~~man~~woman and they express their sexuality in an explicitly consensual manner while respecting that sex is about 2+ people enjoying themselves and not just you being able to please your peen.  Grow the fuck up.",™

t5_2qh1i,FishFloyd,1383191225,"""Carbonic Acid"" is what's produced by the dissolution of CO2 in H2O.   Take the following reactions:  CO2(aq) + H2O(l) ↔ H2CO3(aq)  H2CO3 ↔ HCO3^1- + H^+1  This shows the production of carbonic acid in water - carbonic acid is a weak acid, meaning that it doesn't fully dissolve in water under normal conditions and thus has a much lower concentration than the dissolved CO2. It plays an important role in the transmission of CO2 out of the body.   Note that this is more of a theoretical acid than anything, as it will dissolve with any presence of H20 - which is always if it's aqueous. ",↔

(*Sigh*)  Anyways, here's a little bit of information that was published in the Journal of Plastic and Film Sheeting, October 1987, Vol 3. The article is called ""Investigating the Thermoformability of UMHW-Polyethylene."" Thank you, Raymond Gauvin, for scientifically confirming what I was telling all of these haters here.  ""Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) possess outstanding physical and mechanical properties such as: high impact strength, excellent abrasion resistance, self-lubrication; and resistance to chemical attack. The material has a network of super-structure formed by entanglements of long molecular chains.""  There are a few key words there, notably ""self-lubrication"" and ""high impact resistance."" A simple google search reveals that the BMagic that I so dearly refer to is constructed of a UHMW swirl sintered polyethylene base. Thus one can conclude that my experiences are confirmed by the observations that Dr Gauvin had also noted. I think it's worth noting that Dr. Gauvin is a professor of mechanical engineering in Montreal.   Looking through that paper, it is also worth noting that Dr. Gauvin performed stress tests on several UHMW-PE materials at several different temperatures. Two different UHMW-PE's were tested - and guess what? When subjected to heat, the tensile strength dramatically decreased as heat increased. Indeed, the materials also deformed under less pressure at higher heat.  What does this mean? Well it means that alot of people in this thread ARE VERY MISINFORMED. **It also means that the less heat you subject your base to, the better.** It also means that it is probably WORSE for your bases to over wax them and subject them to heat.   While doing a little bit more of research, I also found that there is another man who has done some extensive research on the same topic of UHMW-PE fibers. I am going to cut and paste some of his work here for you to see. His name is, Hassanin, Ahmed and you can find it in this paper ""Improving UV Resistance of High Performance Fibers. North Carolina State University, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2011. 3538370.""  ""Degradation of a polymer indicates change to inferior state. **For example, a material becomes  brittle, soft, or weak. The factors causing the degradation as a result of material exposure can  be divided into two classes; energetic (such as exposure to thermal**, mechanical, and/or  radiant (UV) energy) and chemical (such as hydrolytic and oxidative) (34)......  .....Most of the data published on degradation of high performance fibers are reported by the  fiber producers. [It is shown] that the Zylon® fiber strength decreases sharply with exposure time and the rate of degradation reduces exponential with time. The residual strength of Zylon® fiber after 6 months of exposure to  daylight is about 35%.""   What does this mean? Don't be a douche like cantpee, and actually ride your snowboard, base down.   Kyle, stick to LibTech - they've made the best bases that I have dealt with, and I'm speaking from real world experience, not theoretical mountain experience like cantpee. Rome, Burton, Forum, and K2 bases have all given me issues. Lib tech hasn't given me a single issue.   Here's a snap of the base on the 2009 Banana Magic that I own - I can honestly say there is zero chance that I have waxed this thing more than 4 times. There are easily 150+ days on it.

t5_2qh1i,IFeelLikeAndy,1383196694,"A very popular piece that has been shared by the millions, this untitled work was completed in what experts like to believe was early 2010. This colorful picture consists of two vertical frames to help further explain the message being told to the viewer by the artist.  In Frame One *(Top)*, we can clearly see a framed photo of musician, Kanye West, wearing a plaid shirt while sporting a navy blue hat. The photo has the following message written on it in what we can safely assume is a fine black Sharpie™, *""To Kanye, Love Kanye""*. Behind the framed photo we can see a travel size bottle of mouthwash showing us that whomever owns this autographed photo also cares about their own personal hygiene and perhaps the way they look all together.  Now, in Frame Two *(Bottom)*,  we can now see who the owner of this lovely autograph is in the reflection of a mirror. By Golly! *It's Kanye West, himself!* Mr. West is admiring the inspirational photo of himself as if saying, ""You can do it!"" or ""Hang in there!"" while happily grinning like an absolute moron. This adds much to the piece because we can now see that it is not a dramatic photo, but a comedic one and should only be taken as so. The artist does a very fine job of showing the comedic value of this work by simply expressing the fact that Kanye West has a signed photo of himself and this only exemplifies the idea that West is a self-centered, pretentious, man.  **Title:** Unknown **Artist:** Unknown **Date:** circa 2010",™

t5_2qhc8,Lost_Thought,1383230546,"&gt; A buddy of mine keeps saying things like ""You don't have to hit with a 50 cal"" and similar, explaining that a hit near a person will be lethal.  [Mythbusters Episode 123:](http://mythbustersresults.com/curving-bullets)  ""*The sonic boom or shockwave from a supersonic bullet can break glass.*   **BUSTED**  To test this myth, Adam and Jamie used a .50 caliber rifle capable of shooting bullets at 1,984 mph (3192 km/hr), well above the speed of sound. They set up a series of glass panes, stemware, and light bulbs surrounding the path of the bullet. Even with the bullet passing within inches of the glass objects, nothing broke as a result of the passing bullet.""  I would link the clip in question but I was unable to find one online. Watching that makes it absolutely clear that a .50 bmg round passing within inches of even fragile glassware causes absolutely zero damage.  [Relevant GatFact™](http://i.imgur.com/xojg1A0.jpg)  &gt; Maybe he's confusing the .50 BMG with the 30mm? What about those? The Apache footage you see on youtube and similar doesn't make it look like the 30mm is being too surgical but ""insurgents"" or whatever seem to be dropping anyway.  **No need for a direct hit.**  [""The M789 is typically used in the M230. Each round contains 21.5 g (0.76 oz) of explosive charge sealed in a shaped-charge liner. The liner collapses into an armor-piercing jet of metal that is capable of penetrating more than 2 inches of RHA. Additionally, *the shell is also designed to fragment upon impact.* **The lethal radius against unprotected, standing targets is about 10 ft** (3.0 m) under optimum conditions.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M230_chain_gun)  ",™

Heat stroke and hospitalization may occur in some people, especially in warm weather and during vigorous exercise. Children are more likely to experience this problem. Talk with your doctor before using these medications together. Drink plenty of fluids during warm weather and when exercising. Call the doctor if you have decreased sweating or a fever. You may also experience drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness when taking these medications together. Avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the medications affect you. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.  ethinyl estradiol ↔ lamotrigine Applies to: Necon 1 / 35 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone), Lamictal (lamotrigine) Talk to your doctor before using lamoTRIgine together with ethinyl estradiol. Combining these medications may reduce the blood levels and effects of lamoTRIgine. You may need a dose adjustment if you have been taking lamoTRIgine and are starting treatment with ethinyl estradiol. Similarly, if ethinyl estradiol is discontinued, your dosage of lamoTRIgine may need to be readjusted. Contact your doctor if your condition changes or you experience loss of seizure control during treatment with these medications. When ethinyl estradiol is stopped or interrupted briefly, be alert to potentially increased side effects of lamoTRIgine such as dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, incoordination, tremor, restlessness, irritability, depression, anxiety, and mood or behavior changes. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.  ethinyl estradiol ↔ topiramate Applies to: Necon 1 / 35 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone), Topamax (topiramate) Using ethinyl estradiol together with topiramate can alter the effects of ethinyl estradiol. Topiramate can make birth control pills less effective, which may result in pregnancy. Before taking topiramate, tell your doctor if you use birth control pills. If you are using oral contraceptives you should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during topiramate therapy. Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be considered during topiramate therapy. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.  norethindrone ↔ lamotrigine Applies to: Necon 1 / 35 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone), Lamictal (lamotrigine) Talk to your doctor before using lamoTRIgine together with norethindrone. Combining these medications may reduce the blood levels and effects of lamoTRIgine. You may need a dose adjustment if you have been taking lamoTRIgine and are starting treatment with norethindrone. Similarly, if norethindrone is discontinued, your dosage of lamoTRIgine may need to be readjusted. Contact your doctor if your condition changes or you experience loss of seizure control during treatment with these medications. When norethindrone is stopped or interrupted briefly, be alert to potentially increased side effects of lamoTRIgine such as dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, incoordination, tremor, restlessness, irritability, depression, anxiety, and mood or behavior changes. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.  TL:DR Version: Topamax doesn't seem to have an effect on lamictal, but does reduce the effectiveness of Necon, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of Lamictal leaving you in a sort of limbo.   Any rashes you develop should be checked out by a doctor if they persist for more than a few days.

Women and children relocated to re-purposed ghost towns or new ones. families and communities were split up and isolated. The living conditions were your stereotypical prison gulag (This one is from my highschool history textbook which I don't know the title of). Lacking of hygiene, space and food.  This [site](http://www.yesnet.yk.ca/schools/projects/canadianhistory/camps/internment1.html) is painful to read but it claims that a portion of Japanese Canadians seized were deported back to Japan. That's more or less what I remember from my highschool textbook. Many Japanese insisted on remaining in Canada despite losing everything they owned and all their rights.  I can't find anything about day to day activities. They were treated as PoW and not because there's some specific politically motivated campaign. It's likely that no efforts were taken to document how they were treated.  I think the textbook was:  Canadian History: 1900-2000 © 2000  Authors: Hundey, Ian, Michael Magarrey, and Norma Pettit.

t5_2qh33,Nezumify,1383254090," You pay 7 cents less and can be fined up to 1k for trying to pump because Oregon is scared that normal people are handling a class 1 flammable liquid. Sounds more like kids then kings. I'll deal with the rain like an adult.  ""Gas/Diesel Taxes Copyright © 1999Gas and diesel is taxed at the rate of 30 cents per gallon in Oregon. By comparison, the gas tax in Washington state is 37.5 cents per gallon, and 46.6 cents per gallon in California (the nation’s highest). In addition, Multnomah county (where Portland is located) has a .03 cents per gallon tax and Washington county has a .01 cent per gallon tax. Oregon gas tax ranks in the top 10 states.  Only service station attendants can pump gas in Oregon. Visit the Oregon Department of Transportation Web site to learn more.  Oregon usually tops the nation in overall gas prices.

t5_2s641,Xer0daze,1383262167,"There is very little risk of a beta driver causing any significant problems with 'known good' applications. The general rule for public betas is ""if it's not broke, don't touch it"" This is mainly due to the fact that application profiles are specific to each game and they won't usually break something further down the stack in a beta as it creates more work. There are changelogs with every beta driver when they are released and I've read through all the 13.11 beta changelogs so far. Any significant change should be documented in these changlogs. Virtually all of the changes and modifications for the 13.11 beta sets have been for Battlefield 4 specifically. For example - in the last release (Beta 8) The only documented change was ""Increases AMD CrossFire​™​ scaling up to an additional 20% for Battlefield 4"". You can always upgrade from beta to WHQL without much worry as well. However, to answer your question specifically - Yes, the only thing to do for right now is wait it out. Shouldn't be long. ",™
