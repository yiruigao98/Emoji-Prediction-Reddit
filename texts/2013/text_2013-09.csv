t5_2v620,LemurianLemurLad,1377994725,"I would strongly suggest watching some videos by Direwolf20 on youtube.  He does a *fantastic* job of explaining how and why he's doing things, as well as knowing the modded minecraft scene as well as (and probably better than) pretty much anybody.  I would recommend either his ""Let's Play Season 5"" series, which is a bit more detail oriented with mod explainations but rather out-of-date (1.4.7), or ""Server Play Season 5"" series which is more recent (1.5.2) but less of a teaching tool.  Additionally, his ""Mod Spotlights"" are *fantastic* teaching tools about the basics of individual mods, but not really useful for understanding how the mods work together.  When you get curious about a specific function like ""how the hell do I make a mystcraft age"" or ""what does MineFactory Reloaded *do*"", check out the spotlight and he'll run you through the items, blocks and mechanics.  Additionally, I'd consider holding off for a few weeks as the 1.6 patches for many of the mods are getting ""close to release""™ and are looking like a pretty big leap forward.  As a new FTB'er, you may also want to steer clear of modpacks that include the mod ""gregtech"" as it increases the difficulty of *many* things, including vanilla mechanics.  If, once you get into non-gregtech FTB, you are bored by how easy things are, then you should consider a gregtech world.  (Personally, I don't like gregtech at all, but no matter what, I wouldn't recommend it for someone new to the scene.)  Edit:  Also, you will want to bookmark http://ftbwiki.org/Feed_The_Beast_Wiki - your brain will probably explode trying to figure things out without access to that site.",™

t5_2qh1s,mega_shit,1377997306,"from the article:  &gt; The study examines the ways that stock prices change between the time that it is announced that a company will be added or removed from a stock index (such as the S&amp;P500) and when the companyâ€™s stock is actually added.Â  The research suggests that canny institutional investors can make a profit in this period that results in a drag on performance for index fund investors.   You do know that changing the list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 happens only like 5 times a year or so right?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies#Recent_changes_to_the_list_of_S.26P_500_Components  And that's out of 500 companies!

People seem perplexed when I tell them I hate college, but it's not too hard to figure out why, given this kind of bullcrap.  Fuck it. Personal story time!  Once, I had this SJW Canadian instructor who taught World Geography for basic credits. I like to call that my ""Canadian World Geography"" class, because 60 minutes of every hour-and-a-half of the class would be spent listening to her monologue about how Canada was so much better than the U.S., and how Canada respected women's rights, and how Canada was some kind of fucking icon of immortality and equality.  The kicker came when one day, she told us to come in with colored pencils (what the fuck is this, third grade?). She had us draw our version of a world map on some paper, allegedly to see how much general knowledge we had. Once we were all finished, she took our papers up front and began selecting some from the 40-something maps. She put them up individually on her projector.  Some people were geographically handicapped; others had a decent understanding of national borders. Some thought the United States was Earth, and some didn't even have a clue where the U.S. even was. Now, me, I keep a photograph in my head of the world map. I did my best to follow that picture, filling in shit like Sri Lanka and Lesotho and all these places my classmates had apparently never heard of. And I did a damn good job on that map. Or so I thought.  She ended up selecting mine. While my classmates were stunned, Canadian World Geography Social Justice Wombat looked peeved. And what did she say to my complex geographical knowledge?  ""Canada is a little small. It's important to remember that not all countries are the U.S., and that some nations deserve to be recognized for their achievements in equality. I've had students forget Canada altogether in such detailed maps - most of them were, of course, boys.""  I couldn't even... I did not have words. I went all thin-lipped. And I dropped that goddamn class later on because her shit just would not stop. And I'm a chick, too... what was going through her head, besides air and fem-centric titty cancer ribbons?  **TL;DR - Never take World Geography with Canadians.**",™

""Remember Me"" is the only *really* Crusher-centric episode I can think of, and I'm sorry, but she kind of sucked.   Don't get me wrong. My Trek fanhood was born with TNG, and every single cast member will always have a place in my heart, including McFadden. But that doesn't mean I'm blind to its faults.

t5_2s580,kellyMILKIES,1378071652,"Witch hunt threads should be deleted. Why? Because pros stop going to reddit to help people or reply to fans which is a treat to fans. Pretty much half the sc2 personalities stopped replying on reddit. Another half of that just stopped reading reddit completely cause it made them so mad.  Witch hunt eventually becomes the truth even if some of them are not any where close to the truth.  (I would know.. :p)  In dota2 this is already starting and happening for the pros.  Just my 2 cents.   As for me. I know this sub reddit hates me. I can't even fking reply normally without getting down voted because of this retarded circle jerk about me. Come on guys. Everyone asked me to make a fake acc to reply here. Like seriously why should I? I end up just not ever replying even if I knew an answer to a question someone needed help with and PM them instead. Not like I'm giving them wrong answers because I help by checking with my team first before replying. This leads to other people who wants to know the answer to a dota2 related question as well unanswered when I can get a correct answer to help from a pro player. I'm not so affected by this anymore since a year ago. But can people honestly understand how OTHER more popular personalities or pros feel compared to me?  Pain amplified x10 for them.  If the community wants good content and great interaction from the pro scene. Please earn it by behaving yourself first.   I am in no way referring to myself. Circlejerking about me can continue I am fine with it (everybody needs a villian.. :p) But please stop this witch hunt shit for real and stop being unnecessary and unreasonably harsh with players and valve.   This is why we can't have nice things... :(   What makes a game or sport amazing is not the people who are competing. It is the fans and the crowd and community.  If we want to be taken seriously and be bigger amd better, then we have to be what we want people who are not as involved in the scene see it.  The eSports scene is magical. We should really show it. How do you think it looks like when we are always fighting with league to outsiders? We are like 2 stubborn children fighting over a bar of chocolate when we can just break it into half and share it happily.  Don't even get me started on the comments on the ""hate"" threads.  Seriously. Get a sibling or cousin who doesn't know anything about the eSports scene nor play the game and get them to read it. I promise you they will say they will never want to try the game.  Loda today mentioned Dota 2 has one of the best community now out there and he is very proud of what it has grown into compared to dota1. It helped him grew as a person too. But this is because he knows the scene and even though he is hated here he still loves the community. So do I. Loda and I host fan meets out of our own pocket and contacts out of love for the fans.  Even the Alliance boys. We believe that for every 1 loud mouth hater there is 100 silent fans. (When I say haters im refering to those that say stupid things... not people who don't support us. Even we are fans of other teams.)  To sum this up cause I need to sleep.. the community is amazing now. But we can also be easily better :)♥♥  Be the change you wish to see in the world. ",♥

My best memories from being a kid are just playing in the back garden, or strawberry picking, so you're already doing awesome! Picnics are always lovely and make great memories! I think honestly the best things you can do are the outdoors-y nature type things.

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1378083096,"it's time for **RageChat™**  i feel like the OP behind this comic is a lot smarter than they're letting on. what we have here is clearly a very simple narrative; it's so threadbare that you wonder how OP rationalised creating the comic in the first place. however the methodical, step-wise sequencing really draws us into OP's thought process at the time, and the panels feel *really* well separated; the fact that we get a panel dedicated to OP seeing his friend and one dedicated to the poking itself highlights both the fact that OP was sure it was his friend he was poking (a belief later shown to be false) and emphasises the social obliviousness of OP himself by compartmentalising his thoughts into disparate panels. first he saw his friend, THEN he thought ""let's poke him""; they were separate thoughts, and i feel like this is important.  the use of the extra panel at the end here is really interesting; it hammers home the awkwardness of the encounter while also implying that OP didn't apologise or do what a reasonable person would. instead, there was just silence. i really feel like there's some serious self-deprecation taking place here, and it engenders me to the OP.  hell even the structure of the panels themselves seemingly illustrates this point. the fact that the faces remain in the same location panel after panel after panel suggests OP has a dearth of creativity, and reinforces the notion that he is a clinical, calibrated sort of guy who has next to no social graces. the reddit watermark also adds to the effect.  look, this can't really win a RageChoice™ Award; it's too simple &amp; rote to truly elevate itself from the crowd. but it takes what would normally be a pretty sub-standard story idea and executes it so well that i can't help but be impressed.  **RageScore™**: 82",™

t5_2skgs,smokedoutraider,1378094802,"I personally would go the networking (Routing and Switching) direction as there seems to be more job openings and opportunities in that area. The CCNA Security isn't something I've ever looked into but according to [the Cisco website](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/ccna_security/index.html) you need the CCNA Routing and Switching certification before you can take the CCNA Security exam. If you plan on doing CISSP I don't think there is much use in doing the CCNA or CCNP Security, but this is something that will most likely differ per job. (Others have pointed out CCNA Security is good for government employment, so you should definitely take those suggestions into account)  About the Microsoft certification, you are absolutely correct and I just automatically said MCTS (force of habit, sorry) The MCSA, specifically Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 are good starting points. I wouldn't worry too much about Windows 8 (let's face it, how many businesses are ever going to downgrade to that OS?) Windows Server 2012 could come in handy, but from my experience I've noticed businesses are slow to adopt new software, and seeing as many have just recently switched to Server 2008 you should be safe with the 2008 cert.  I suggest starting with the MCSA and then moving onto the MCITP. [This article](http://www.learninglolly.com/MCSA_Certification.html) explains the point of the certifications rather well. (Check out the previous and next buttons at the bottom of that page for further analysis)  Now when it comes to CISSP, you could jump right into it without any CCNA/CCNP but my concern would be: How high is the demand for Security Analysts/Architects etc at the moment? Based on the demand of the area you live in I would make this decision. In my area it would be smarter to go for CCNA/CCNP as it seems to be in high demand, and right now the most important thing for you to do is start working on the experience. Check your local job listings and plan accordingly, and who knows, you might land a job that is even willing to pay for one or two of your certificates.  **This isn't the only consideration to make with CISSP**, as experience is a requirement for the exam. [Check out the requirements](https://www.isc2.org/cissp-how-to-certify.aspx)  From the Article linked above and [Associate of ISC](https://www.isc2.org/associates/default.aspx)   *Candidates must have a minimum of five (5) years of direct full-time professional security work experience in two or more of the ten domains of the (ISC)² CISSP CBK®. Candidates may receive a one year experience waiver with a four-year college degree, or regional equivalent OR additional credential from the (ISC)² approved list, thus requiring four (4) years of direct full-time professional security work experience in two or more of the ten domains of the CISSP CBK.*  *Don't have the experience? Become an Associate of (ISC)² by successfully passing the CISSP exam. You'll have six years to earn your experience to become a CISSP.*  *The Associate of (ISC)² status is available to qualified candidates who:*  + Subscribe to the (ISC)² Code of Ethics  + Pass the CAP®, CCFPSM, CISSP®, CSSLP® or SSCP® certification exams based on the (ISC)² CBK®, our taxonomy of information security topics.  + Once Associate of (ISC)² status is obtained, a minimum of Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits in accordance with the appropriate Associate of (ISC)² designation and Annual Maintenance Fees (AMFs) of $US35 are required.

t5_2qh6c,cabbagery,1378100960,"&gt; This is not only an *ad hominem* attack (I personally take offense). . .  Just because you are offended does not make something *ad hominem*. Christians who parrot young-earth creationism *do* make themselves look dumb, ignorant, or worse. Chief among the reasons for this, from a Christian's perspective, should be the fact that a belief in young-earth creationism is theologically irrelevant to Christianity, and as such the insistence that it be taken seriously detracts from the Christian's proper goal: spreading the message of Christ and being both salt and light to the world.  &gt; The only time a hypothesis should be disregarded is when a falsifying test actually manages to falsify a hypothesis.  The hypothesis that the earth is on the order of 10,000 years old has been falsified, with convergent evidences from every relevant field.  &gt; No science on creationism? You tell people to shut up, while knowing **absolutely nothing** on the science *[sic]* behind creationism?  (Emphasis yours.)  I never said I knew ""absolutely nothing"" about creationist claims, nor did I suggest I lacked knowledge on any specific subject whatsoever. Indeed, I didn't make any statement concerning my credentials, apart from noting that I did not speak with authority so much as with confidence. Nice try.  As I said, there is no 'science' behind creationism -- it is in fact the antithesis of science. There may or may not be scientific claims, observations, or hypotheses which are *compatible* with creationism, but creationism itself -- specifically, young-earth creationism -- is not science, and no, there is no science which supports it.  &gt; I actually wanted to know your knowledge regarding both sides of the debate. . .  There are not merely 'two' sides to this, and there is not a 'debate.' The legitimacy of young-earth creationism is no more of a debate than the legitimacy of claims that the earth rests on the backs of elephants -- the primary differences being that a) the view that the earth rests on elephants (and eventually turtles ""all the way down"") is not common to what I presume to be our shared culture, and b) not much is required with respect to education or evidence to convince an otherwise ignorant person that the earth in fact does not rest on elephants, whereas some science education *is* generally needed to convince the same sort of person that young-earth creationism is false.  &gt; . . . and you have admitted that you have absolutely no knowledge of the science behind creationism.  I have done no such thing. This is textbook dishonesty.  &gt; My words were chosen carefully so as not to deceive.  See above. Not so carefully after all, eh?  &gt;  To aid you in this new quest, I could start by pointing you to [a website with apparently twenty or so articles cross-listed under about a dozen somewhat related categories, none of which promote creationism, but rather highlight the uncontroversial fact that we don't know everything]  Wow, that was helpful. /s  Whenever I am pointed to 'resources' such as this, however, I like to find out something about the person or organization behind the source. In this case, I found that the collector of these articles has written for organizations such as ICR, including a wonderful example of the *tu quoque* fallacy when facing the question of distant starlight. I don't mean to say that every article by this person betrays similar fallacy, but that one sure did, and it is right in his wheelhouse given his employment history. I was also amused to find that he is my academic peer (though much further along in his career, and evidently lacking in future academic pursuit).  &gt; And indeed, there is a case to be made for creationism. If it wasn't relevant, why is it in the bible?  First, the case being made here is with respect to theological significance, not for scientific significance. Let's keep that at the forefront, because we don't want to be deceptive, right? Second, your question is odd indeed. If 'being in the bible' is sufficient for a thing to be theologically significant, then I expect you are an advocate for chattel slavery, yes?  Somehow, I get the impression that most Christians accept the notion that not everything in the bible is theologically significant. I highly doubt any Christian thinks one's status as a True Christian® hinges on accepting that Saul was ""relieving himself"" (KJV) as opposed to 'taking a shit' (my paraphrase) when David cut his robe -- yet that passage is also included in the bible.  Again, if your position is that a belief in young-earth creationism is a necessary condition for being a True Christian®, make your case, or at least state that view explicitly. Otherwise, this is all bluster, and hence my original point stands: insisting that young-earth creationism, which is falsified by every relevant field, is a legitimate view -- indeed, insisting as much *instead of* advancing the core tenets of Christianity -- is anathema to Christ's message. As I noted, it does a disservice to Christianity.  &gt; [The fourth] commandment has significance partly based on it's *[sic]* **time period of one day, being 24 hours**.  (Emphasis yours)  &gt; So if death only entered the world when Adam who was a human being, was alive, then how did things die before him according to the model of evolution?  I am an atheist, yet even I, as so many Christians in this sub, can see that idiomatic nuance can apply both to time (day-age) and death (physical-spiritual). Why is that so hard for you to see, accept, or at least acknowledge?  &gt; Please, give me a scripture where Christ silenced those proclaiming the word of God without using the word of God (correction).  Unnecessary -- I have provided scriptural references in virtually every comment I've made in this sub. You are asking for me to provide an example of something neither of us have done.  &gt; And even just one scripture where Paul tells someone to shut up.  Have you even *read* the Pauline epistles? In virtually *every one* he tells the addressees to shut up. Perhaps you're offended by the use of modern vernacular and slang rather than the graceful euphemisms Paul employed, but the result is the same: he and I have each suggested that those who preach theologically unsound messages *shut up*. Young-earth creationism is theologically unsound -- it is not significant. For a specific and apt example, see Paul's letter to the Galatians ([Chapter 6, verse 15 being especially relevant here](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206&amp;version=NIV) -- replace ""circumcision"" with ""young-earth creationism,"" and see how it reads).  ---  Look, this isn't a debate sub, and while you're obviously keen on having a debate regarding the legitimacy of young-earth creationism, I would prefer to respect this sub and its rules. My efforts here were merely to note that the YEC does a disservice to Christianity by detracting from its proper goals, and in doing so she in fact turns people *away* from Christianity. If you would like to engage in a debate on the merits of young-earth creationism, we can do that, too, in /r/DebateReligion, or perhaps in /r/DebateAChristian or /r/DebateAnAtheist. I'll leave it to you to start such a topic in one of those subs, where myself and many others besides will happily engage you.  I admonish you, however, to recognize the folly -- a term Paul used in reference to the [Galatians](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&amp;version=NIV), no less -- in advancing young-earth creationism rather than following the call of Christ. As I have said, doing so makes you look dumb, ignorant, or worse.",®

t5_2qh16,10b-5,1378110878,"&gt; You're basically equating privacy with all things illegal in this statement.  No I am not, does nobody in this subreddit have basic reading comprehension skills?  &gt;Using TOR gives a measure of privacy, which allows certain unsavory people to perform illegal acts. Does that mean TOR = Privacy = Illegal activities? No, I don't believe that's sound logic.  Neither do I. I merely criticizing him for cherry picking the most sympathetic example you could possibly think off, instead of a more balanced representation of what TOR is used for. Which is both Good™ causes and Bad™ causes.  I'm willing to bet a lot that OPVA is more visited than any Syrian discussion forum.   &gt;Being an apostate where it is illegal to be one is one example for the need of privacy.  Yes, it is indeed.  &gt; There are literally infinite scenarios, and not even the majority of them include things categorized illegal.  I certainly think you're wrong about that. ",™

I am happy to have you in my life. All of you have made such a huge difference in the quality of my life, and have increased my joy so much. You have even lowered my bitterness and lessened how cynical I was.  I can never thank you enough for being there for me. For loving me as I am. For caring about how I am doing. For wanting to be my friend. For being you. Seriously, no matter what I do, my thanks will never be adequate enough for what you have provided me.

t5_2tx47,flyingfresian,1378119289,"Happy Mondays to all :)  Yesterday started shitty - random feelings of sadness and ickiness - but improved vastly.  /u/joni1 is a wee love who sorted me out with some gold and /u/Q-Kat kindly shared her Prime love with me.  Neither of these things are what jostled me out of my misery, but it's wonderful to know that people online care.  I love you guys.  The massive dod of cheesecake I ate helped a lot with the sadness too.  It was chocolate brownie cheesecake and it was AMAZING.  I went to visit my best friend last night - she just bought her first house.  I got **horribly** lost on the way there but found it in the end.  It's a lovely house and she really liked the card I made for her - Tinychatters have already seen it as I made it while I was in TC the other night :)  Mr Fresian decided that we should have a weekly movie night where we cook dinner together and watch a film.  This is an unprecedented display of thoughtfulness.  I'm delighted with the gesture and this week we're going to go out with friends to see Elysium as our inaugural adventure.  Exciting!  Eek, this has turned in to a wall of text.  Hope you all have a lovely day.  As I'm working from home today I'm available if you need someone to talk to via PM or just generally ♥",♥

He has learned to open the kitchen cabinet and take all kinds of bad foods. I found him passed out beside a half eaten breakfast bar and I thought he was dead. I've tried everything to keep him out, he's even learned to peel duct tape with his teeth. 😑 I'm probably going to have to re locate all the food to a top cabinet because he is dead set on killing himself with all that sugar. Hopefully I can get him on a healthier diet lol. Thank you for taking the time to type that all for me! I really appreciate it. :)",😑

Again, please note, NO CLINICAL STUDIES reported any eye color change whatsoever.  The FDA requires Allergan to add the ""brown pigmentation change"" disclaimer due to Lumigan, a product with the same active ingredient as Latisse which is placed directly IN the eye as opposed to Latisse, which is a topical product. Keep in mind that the brown pigmentation must be PRESENT in your eyes to be a rare person who may experience their brown pigmentation enlarging with the use of Lumigan, not Latisse.  ",®

t5_2u1rr,not_always_sane,1378180765,"Good question. Part of the problem that I see is that people use local tap water with radiator coolant and batteries when they should be using distilled water only. The vehicle manufacturers factor the type of hard water where their vehicles are used into which antifreeze to use. There would not be much of a problem if everyone used distilled water to dilute the antifreeeze to 50/50. I would use what is recommended. HOAT is recommended for my '03 Rubicon so I use Zerex G-05 from NAPA. That said, here is a site with more information:  http://donsnotes.com/home_garden/auto/antifreeze.html  Here is part of the article:  &gt;Anti-freeze - Almost all use ethylene glycol (EG) or propylene glycol (PG) (newer) for the antifreeze base. &gt;Anti-corrosion -  &gt;Conventional - Green/Yellow antifreeze contains silicates, phosphates and / or borates as corrosion inhibitors to keep the solution alkaline. This is called Inorganic Additive Technology (IAT) &gt;European car makers like VW specify coolant additives lacking in phosphates and including borates and low silicates (such as VW's G11 (blue)) because their water is harder and it reacts with phosphates to create aluminum phosphate or calcium and magnesium deposits. See more on problems with phosphates at autorepair.about.com The Japanese disagree and specify mixtures high in phosphates and low in borates and silicates because they fear lack of maintenance will cause borate corrosion. &gt;Tap water in North America also contains calcium, but isn't as hard as European tap water so phosphates are considered okay to use here. Organic Acid Technology (OAT) or Extended Life Antifreeze Coolant (XLC or ELC) antifreeze contains neutralized organic acids (organic acid salts) that protect engine parts from corrosion. These include Havoline® XLC, GM's Dex-Cool® (also manufactured by Texaco) and VW's G12. &gt;Honda has an extended-life OAT coolant that is dyed dark green and does not contain 2-EHA. &gt;OAT includes such ingredients as sebacate (Toyota &amp; Honda), 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) and other organic acids, but no silicates or phosphates (except in the case of Toyota's pink extended-life coolant, which adds a dose of phosphate to its extended-life OAT-based antifreeze).  Organic inhibitors do not deplete as quickly as the inorganic inhibitors used in conventional coolants.  &gt;OAT is recommended in engines with aluminum components (heads or radiators) because Borates can be bad for them. OAT coolants also have extended lives, up to 150,000 mi.  &gt;OAT corrosion inhibitors provide excellent long-term protection for aluminum and cast iron, but may not be the best choice for older cooling systems that have copper/brass radiators and heater cores, especially the lead solder used in them. It depends on the formula.  &gt;Hybrid OAT (HOAT) coolants, such as ""Zerex G-05®"" Use organic acids, but not 2-EHA (2-ethylhexanoic acid) (different organic acids are used). Hybrid OAT coolants add some silicate to provide quick-acting protection for aluminum surfaces. Silicate also helps repair surface erosion caused by cavitation in the water pump. Hybrid OAT coolants are currently used by many European vehicle manufacturers (BMW, Mercedes &amp; Volvo) as well as Ford and Chrysler.  Toyota adds some phosphate to their hybrid. &gt;The new universal coolants use unique OAT-based corrosion packages with proprietary organic acids (such as carboxylate) to provide broad spectrum protection.",®

Before the World Cup qualifier against Austria on Friday (from 20.45 clock, live on ZDF) speak national manager Oliver Bierhoff, midfielder Sami Khedira (Real Madrid), and attackers Max Kruse (Borussia Monchengladbach) on the exchange of Mesut Ozil, the duel with David Alaba and Co., defensive virtues and marketing activities. DFB.de summarizes the most important conclusions together.  OLIVER BIERHOFF ABOUT ...  The upcoming match against Austria ...:  ""We want a good start to the World Cup year and expand our strong position in the table. There are always emotional games against Austria. Austrians are incredibly motivated to want to ask us a leg. We have great respect., You have a good coach (Marcel Koller, ed) developed and ten players in the squad who play in the Bundesliga. We are warned, however, want to show on home Pubklikum that Austria has no realistic chance against us. ""  The exchange of ... Mesut Ozil to Arsenal:  ""The change came for us, not surprisingly, we were contacted shortly by Mesut and his management. I'm happy for Mesut that he has such a great club found. He will continue to develop athletic and human in London. Arsenal is a great traditional club with a great coach who can deal well with young people for sports development, it is the right step -.. especially under the aspect that we are in a World Cup year ""  Of violations of ... Lukas Podolski, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Goetze and Ilkay Gundogan:  ""It is of course annoying. Lukas never had a muscle injury, now it has caught up with him., It is reassuring that this happens at the beginning of the World Cup year. It also shows how fast it can go something like even just before a tournament.'ve Luckily we are good alternatives to the positions, so I'm for the Austria game no worries. ""  The presence ... of the injured players during and after the adidas-shooting:  ""The national team in World Cup year is incredibly important. Everybody wants to be there. This is good and important for the team spirit that also stop by and eat with the other players who are not in the squad.  Bierhoff: ""Austrians incredibly motivated"" © Bongarts / GettyImages Bierhoff: ""Austrians incredibly motivated"" SAMI KHEDIRA ABOUT ...  ... the qualifiers against Austria and the Faroe Islands:  ""There are two extremely important games., We can at least do our part to make the qualification already fixed. We're not completely out of the preparation, but fit and fresh in your mind. Course we want to win both games.""  ... his fitness after knee contusion and leadership claims:  ""I assume that I can play on Friday. I see no current problems. My aim is to carry the team. This task is not only on the shoulders of the captain, but it takes more than one player. I want to take responsibility . ""  ... the problems in defense in recent international matches:  ""If you look at the statistics, we got too many goals. However, is not a problem of defense, but of the entire network. We must go back to the old virtues, all eleven men must be compact. Way the defense no longer comes as a tight spot . Let's try against Austria and if possible stay clean sheets. We must remember that we also have to defend the back despite the offensive spectacle. ""  ... the exchange of Mesut Ozil to London:  ""Personally, I regret the change from Mesut. We are very good friends and have even expanded and consolidated in Madrid our friendship. From a sporting point is his departure a loss because Mesut a game can one divorce alone. However we have made up his mind to accept.""  MAX KRUSE ABOUT ...  ... his re-appointment to the national team:  ""Of course I did not expect., It a great honor to get the chance to show me again., The appeal has made me very proud and delighted me. A nomination for any footballer is something extraordinary and boosts self-confidence.  ... its claims in the DFB selection:  ""I am not asking. I'm glad to be here, trying to integrate myself and present myself in training. Everything else will be seen. I let everything come to me and when the coach should take me in a game, then I am there. ""  ... of his colleagues in the attack, Miroslav Klose and Mario Gomez:  ""Miro and Mario are taller than me, so I already am different from the two (laughs) . Both are exceptional strikers who have done a lot for the club and the DFB. I am pleased to be here with both. """,©

t5_2uvah,awfulbad,1378217623,"And yet knowing the daily death toll caused by guns, I know otherwise intelligent gun-owners that fiercely support the 2nd Amendment. When confronted with the slaughter you can see they think it's a really bad thing, but they have to sort of shrug and stand behind their principles because somehow the idea of the 2nd Amendment has lodged itself so deeply into their psyche that it has become sacrosanct.  That willingness to see-no/hear-no-evil put in the context of the U.S. Founding Fathers™ falls a little flat, I think. Because if gun-owners think the intent of the 2nd Amendment was as they say it was, the Founding Fathers had to be cool with a fraction of the population dying for that freedom on a regular basis.

It's something I've put in 5mins, pretty sure it's not optimized and you'll find holes in it. Who cares, you get the idea.   How to wreck things in missions?  Warp in, activate Bastion, use extra projection with Null to smash frigate NPCs while they are closing in (I usually have transversal or radial velocity as overview column to know which ones I should shoot first). Once they're orbiting and you can't hit them anymore, smash cruisers and higher NPCs with Null or Navy Antimatter depending on range. Optional: use drones to kill frigates while dealing with bigger NPCs. Shooting frigates with blasters is a waste when you can let drones do it while you waste other targets.  If all that's left are frigates orbiting you and don't want drones to be shot, wait for Bastion mode to run out (best to anticipate one cycle in advance so you don't have to wait), activate MJD. At 100km away, activate Bastion again, wait for them to come in and smash them to pieces. Sure, you aren't going to do full damage in falloff, but even at 60-70km, all it takes is a single good hit on 4 grouped blasters to wreck them.  Having some battleship NPCs sitting at long range? (quite rare) At more than 50km, use MJD, turn around, then MWD. Less than 50km, just MWD. Funniest moment was the Serpentis / Guristas 120km spawn in Worlds Collide level 4 first room. Jumped straight into the Guristas spawn, then activated Bastion: laughed as they helplessly tried to jam my Kronos while I smashed them to bit at close range. Pay back time for the 1346321 times I got helplessly jammed. That was just my own experience here, your mileage may vary, of course.   Other examples in Bastion (main weapon damage only, no drones here with tech2 weapons, faction WU mods similar on the Kronos setup above). Numbers may be off depending on setup / typos, I'll leave you guys to correct me.   * Paladin with Megapulses and Scorch: 817 DPS at 92km range +21km Falloff. Or 1025 DPS at 31km range +21km falloff with Imperial Navy Multifreq.  * Paladin with Tachyons and Navy Multifreq: 969 DPS at 67km range + 52 Falloff.  * Golem with Fury Cruises: 946 DPS at 208km range (with rigs, they have 361m explosion radius, 125m/s explosion velocity and 13km/s velocity) Or 776 DPS with Navy Cruises.  * Golem with Caldari Navy Torps: 1002 DPS at 37km range (they have 243m explosion radius, 133.125 m/s explosion velocity and 4.2km/s velocity)  * Vargur with 800mm autocannons II with Republic Fleet EMP: 955 DPS at 4km range + 68.8km falloff  * Vargur with 1400mm artilleries, with Republic Fleet EMP: 720DPS at 43km range+134km falloff   Oh yes, and forgot to mention with a proper deadspace X-L shield booster and a good tank, a single Vargur or Golem can tank the first wave of a Vanguard Incursion by itself. Sure, damage isn't that good when you do (you can't use cap booster, go through charges too fast, thus have to go for cap stable ), but the fact remains it's still possible. Even discussing that very fact with other designers as it most likely is far too OP for PvE.   So while there are still concerns for PvP, I don't think you realize how efficient those things are for PvE. We feel like Dr. Frankenstein looking at a slab with a half-decaying corpses coming back to life. We've created monsters. Mission / PvE efficiency is not all about pure damage. It's also about mobility, projection and time you spend shooting. MJD + MWD helps with the first, Bastion plus new Kronos / Paladin bonuses give the second and EW immunity grants you the last.  As such we are definitely not going to give any kind of damage bonus in Bastion mode - if we ever did, it would be by severely penalizing turret tracking / missile explosion velocity when in Bastion mode, which would severally limit their use in PvE.   Hope this wall of text helps a bit (PvE side, as I said, we aren't talking about PvP in this post)   Also, here is a preview of the transformation mode on the Kronos.",™

t5_2qhd7,kristopolous,1378226436,"It is! Instead of spending 10 days rolling your own solution you spend 7 swimming through the documentation, 4 dealing with their crazy abstractions, 6 more debugging their opaque crappy mystery code, and then another 5 trying to make it run in reasonable time. Quite Impressive!  It's a great framework if you want to things to take twice as long as doing them from scratch, enjoy paying inordinate amounts of money, and then have nobody else on the face of the planet know how it works.  Not a single thing is easy with yFiles™. Let's take the yFiles for HTML library, because it's one of my favorites! Remember, this is javascript. This is from their own demo code:  	(typeof define=='function'?define:(function(dependencies, fn){fn();}))(['yfiles/lang'],function(){ 	yfiles.module(""demo.yfiles.graph.tableeditor.style"", function(exports) { 	  /** 	   * Helper class that can be used as StyleTag to bundle common visualization parameters for stripes 	   */ 	  /*public*/ exports.StripeDescriptor = new yfiles.ClassDefinition(function() { 	    return { 	       	      'constructor': function() { 		this.$init(); 	      }, 	       	      '$backgroundBrush': null, 	       	      /** 	       * The background brush for a stripe 	       */ 	      'backgroundBrush': { 		'$meta': function() { 		  return [yfiles.support.DefaultValueAttribute.ConvertedFrom( \                     yfiles.bridge.Brush.$class, ""Transparent""), yfiles.system.TypeAttribute(\                     yfiles.bridge.Brush.$class)]; 		}, 		'get': function() { 		  return this.$backgroundBrush; 		}, 		'set': function(/*yfiles.bridge.Brush*/ value) { 		  this.$backgroundBrush = value; 		} 	      },  What do you suppose that does? How about this line:      graph.nodeDefaults.style = new demo.yfiles.graph.orgchart.styles.LevelOfDetailNodeStyle(new \     yfiles.drawing.TemplateNodeStyle.WithKey(""detailNodeStyleTemplate""), new \     yfiles.drawing.TemplateNodeStyle.WithKey(""intermediateNodeStyleTemplate""), new \     yfiles.drawing.TemplateNodeStyle.WithKey(""overviewNodeStyleTemplate""));  They didn't like Javascript's type system so they **built their own**.  You don't use Javascript's operators you use **yFiles**.  And oh yeah, you don't get the source. The DOM? Event bubbling? Prototypical inheritance? Who needs that!!! You have yFiles!    Their demos have large piles of code to do things like colors and position; what is this CSS nonsense? Who needs such separation of concerns? standards? they make their own!  No no really, let's look at a mouseDown event, this should be fun:        '$onMouseDown': function(/*MouseEvent*/ evt) {         var /*Element*/ graphControlElement = demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.getAncestorElementByAttribute((evt.target instanceof Element) ? /*(Element)*/evt.target : null, ""id"", ""graphControl"");         var /*yfiles.canvas.GraphControl*/ graphControl = graphControlElement !== null ? (graphControlElement[""data-this""] instanceof yfiles.canvas.GraphControl) ? /*(yfiles.canvas.GraphControl)*/graphControlElement[""data-this""] : null : null;         var /*Element*/ svgElement = demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.getAncestorElementByAttribute((evt.target instanceof Element) ? /*(Element)*/evt.target : null, ""data-internalId"", ""MySimpleLabel"");         var /*yfiles.graph.ILabel*/ label = svgElement !== null ? (yfiles.graph.ILabel.isInstance(svgElement[""data-item""])) ? /*(yfiles.graph.ILabel)*/svgElement[""data-item""] : null : null;         if (graphControl !== null &amp;&amp; label !== null) {           var tmp;           var /*yfiles.input.GraphEditorInputMode*/ inputMode = ((tmp = graphControl.inputMode) instanceof yfiles.input.GraphEditorInputMode) ? /*(yfiles.input.GraphEditorInputMode)*/tmp : null;           if (inputMode !== null) {             inputMode.editLabel(label);           }         }       },  And just in case you want to call my bluff on the CSS, here you go. ""Fuck HTML"" they say:        'createButton': function(/*yfiles.canvas.ICanvasContext*/ ctx) {         var /*yfiles.drawing.Image*/ newImage = new yfiles.drawing.Image.WithSource(""resources/edit_label.png"");         {           newImage.bounds = new yfiles.geometry.RectD(1, 1, demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.BUTTON_SIZE - 2, demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.BUTTON_SIZE - 2);         }         var /*yfiles.drawing.Image*/ image = newImage;         var /*yfiles.drawing.RectVisual*/ newRectVisual = new yfiles.drawing.RectVisual();         {           newRectVisual.bounds = new yfiles.geometry.RectD(0, 0, demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.BUTTON_SIZE, demo.yfiles.graph.simplecustomstyle.MySimpleLabelStyle.BUTTON_SIZE);         }         var /*yfiles.drawing.RectVisual*/ button = newRectVisual;         button.setBrush(new yfiles.bridge.SolidColorBrush(yfiles.bridge.Color.fromArgb(20, 0, 0, 0)), ctx);         button.setPen(yfiles.drawing.Pens.BLACK, ctx);         button.setArcRadius(3);          var /*yfiles.canvas.CanvasContainer*/ c = new yfiles.canvas.CanvasContainer();         c.add(button);         c.add(image);         return c;       },  This level of mindfucking nonsense is done everywhere in the source - regardless of language.  They invent their own wheel as much as possible, and then make it twenty times more complex to use (and I mean, like, requiring heavy duty Martin Fowler style software engineering abstractions to like, select a brush), and then make it require 4 times as many lines of code, and all you get is something running at 1/5th the speed.  And I &lt; know &gt; what it is underneath ... after their Enigma machine churns away, it just spits out css styles, 50 layers below.  Perhaps the problem is that my IQ is under 245. I find solving things in yfiles excessively more complex then solving the actual problem, you know, in the underlying language without their nonsense.  It's quite a work.  I have no idea how they stay in business.  It might as well be [BobX](http://thedailywtf.com/Comments/We-Use-BobX.aspx).  ---   Actually, I know exactly how they stay in business.

This makes it look like people are working more.  * Since you are actually taking longer to get shit out the door, your bug count goes down, because there's less things to be buggy.

t5_2qh6c,cabbagery,1378227988,"&gt; While I agree that Christians who parrot make themselves look ignorant. . .  Promoting young-earth creationism is either parroting or charlatanry, and possibly both. Full stop.  &gt; I do feel that when a creationist points [discrepancies in radiometric dating] out, that some conceding must take place.  Okay? That's easy. There are aspects of radiometric dating which are anomalous, and we do not necessarily know the source of the anomalies.  My turn? Let's hear the concession of the young-earth creationist that *every relevant field converges on an old universe, and the YEC timeline is off, using any reasonable measure, by six orders of magnitude*.  &gt; I find it very difficult to find an atheist who concedes anything. . .  Bullshit. Now try that same exercise with a YEC and see how you fare.  &gt; Yes, you avoided [divulging your credentials] as best you could.  I did not so much avoid it as try to steer the discussion back to the central point; this is a red herring. What do you want to hear? That I'm in high school? That I have a Ph.D.? That I have a GED but have a large library? That I am in graduate school? That I dropped out of college to start a dotcom?  Your obsession with my educational credentials is bizarre, and as I've noted, those credentials are here irrelevant.  &gt; What is your knowledge of creationism in a nutshell?  I don't understand the question. I am intimately familiar with the basically literal reading of Genesis 1-2, as well as other ancillary views often held by YECs. Ask a pointed question.  &gt; Why do you think [young-earth creationism is] the antithesis of science?  Science observes the world, takes measurements, builds hypotheses based on the observations and measurements, tests the hypotheses, and revises them as needed. Young-earth creationism observes a book, assumes the book to be accurate in a generally literal reading, and refuses to revise that view, irrespective of countervailing evidence.  ID is a slightly less onerous view, in that it can be argued that an ID proponent at least observes the world (as opposed to blithely accepting a generally literal reading of an old book), takes measurements, and builds a hypothesis from which design is inferred, but it is beset by other sorts of problems (read: type-1 and type-2 errors).  &gt; Does slavery follow any God given model?  I don't believe in any gods, and I don't know what you mean by 'follow.'  That said, chattel slavery is explicitly endorsed by Yahweh, as depicted in the Torah, and it is implicitly endorsed in the Christian New Testament. If you believe Yahweh to be god, and the Torah to be a god-given model, then by extension you also believe that chattel slavery is a component of a god-given model.  &gt; I did start a case [that affirming the young-earth model is a requirement for being a True Christian®]. . .  Yes, and I immediately refuted it. Are you denying that it is possible for the word translated as 'day' ([Strongs H3117](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3117&amp;t=KJV)) might also mean 'age,' or an indefinite but arbitrarily long time period? If so, then you're either delusional or a troll -- starting at Genesis 1, turn the page to Genesis 2, and take a look at verse 17 (NIV):  &gt; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.  The Hebrew, however, uses the same term -- *yowm* -- to describe the time at which Adam's death would occur. This is particularly amusing, given the relevance in this part of our conversation, because you insisted both that the 'day' described in the creation events must be actual 24-hour periods *and* that ""by Adam, death was brought into the world.""  Do you see why I find it amusing? I'll give you a clue: the verse I quoted above uses the same term for 'day,' and the Hebrew term for 'death'; since Adam did not actually die on that day, either the term 'day' must be an idiom for 'age' or an indefinite but arbitrarily long time period, or the term 'death' must be an idiom for a non-physical form of death. Of course, this is an inclusive disjunction -- it could be that both are true.  So with one fell swoop, I've shown that not only is a commitment to young-earth creationism *not* a necessary condition for being a Christian, but it's *impossible* for that to be the case, *given young-earth creationism*.  Yay me!  &gt; [T]he vast majority of Christians throughout history have not wavered in **this**, [until] now.  I need the referent for the bolded term (my emphasis). If you mean to say that the vast majority of Christians throughout history have endorsed young-earth creationism, then that's both false and irrelevant. It's false, because a commitment to young-earth creationism was neither a requirement nor something many Christians bothered to consider, and it's irrelevant because the modern views with respect to cosmology, biology, etc., did not exist.  Indeed, when Darwin's ideas postulated the need for millions of years in order for evolution to take place, it was widely rejected, because the sun was at the time thought to combust. Combustion, of course, requires fuel, but the sun's fuel would not have lasted long enough for the timeframes Darwin needed. This worry fueled (pun intended) study of the sun, and helium was thereby discovered, but it was another 70 years before fusion -- a power source which could easily satisfy Darwin's timeframes -- was discovered.  Never mind that geologists had for many, many years accepted that the earth was much older than a paltry 10,000 years, and as many Christians are quick to point out (however fallaciously), most scientists in Western history have been Christians.  &gt; As my case suggests, the creation week is to be remembered weekly via the fourth commandment. [. . .] If you take away the literal days, then what about the Sabbath?  That's both simplistic and incomplete. While the Sabbath was recognized as one day of seven, it was also recognized as one year of fifty. At the very least, this demonstrates nuance with respect to the rest period -- it readily admits of symbolism -- and it doesn't take much to see that humans rest one day in seven, the land rests one year in fifty, so maybe the solar system or universe might 'rest' one [yet longer timeframe] in [seven, fifty, three hundred forty-three, two thousand four hundred one, etc.].  I suspect you are also somewhat oblivious to the Jewish tradition of numerology and the numerical symbolism they employ(ed).  &gt; I fear for the classical [. . .] beliefs of Christians when [an unraveling of belief due to an admission that young-earth creationism is false] seems to be happening.      I must not fear.      Fear is the mind-killer.      Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.      I will face my fear.      I will permit it to pass over me and through me.      And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.      Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.     Only I will remain.  That is a problem, mind you, but surely you can see how pitiful a worry it is. I'm reminded of a petulant Peter, refusing to eat bacon, even as it was lowered on a sheet in his vision. Young-earth creationists are like unto Peter -- they refuse to accept the notion that their view could be incorrect, and the result is a fragile and brittle perspective. It's absolutely true that young Christians raised in fundamentalist traditions (i.e. young-earth creationists) are leaving the church in droves, and it's absolutely due to the pathetic insistence that young-earth creationism is the capstone of their beliefs. Yet that is unbiblical and un-Christian.  ---  RE: debating young-earth creationism in this sub  I suspect that enough time has passed that our conversation isn't getting much in the way of attention, so it's probably okay. It just seems like we're using the sub as a proxy for /r/DebateAChristian (or /r/DebateAnAtheist), and that was never my intent. I feel I have made my point crystal clear with respect to the problem the insistence that young-earth creationism be heard poses for Christianity, and the fact that it should be considered theologically inconsequential.  Again, if you'd like to pursue a debate as to the facts surrounding the observed age of the universe (and things in it), we can do that. I'll leave it to you to purse such an endeavor in whatever manner you see fit (by continuing here, via PM, or in a new topic in a more appropriate sub).",®

t5_2qh1i,SplodeyDope,1378231013,"**Desiderata**   Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2qwze,internetvoyeur,1378237343,Your looking for a financial planner. There are lots of independent ones out there that charge a one time fee or a % basis.  Make sure you use a CFP® when using one. Go to the site www.cfp.org to find how to find one and questions you should ask.   A lot of FA's DON'T use in house funds. A good FA worth his/her salt will use a mixture of ETF/index funds and  actively managed. Also make sure the FA is or on a team with a CFP®.   The BIG difference with an annual check up and full time FA is that you can and the FA should talk several times a year. Adjust your allocations and modify your plan on call.   Questions you should ask yourself.   1. Am I good investor?  Do you tend to get into it for a few days then forget about your portfolio for a couple quarter?  2. What concerns you the most?  Watching the account value go up and down or the cost for financial advice?  If your concerned about cost and are tend to tune in and out of the market then maybe an FA is better for you.   If your tuned into your investments on a regular basis but don't know what your shooting for maybe planner is right for you.   If you are tuned in on investments and cost is a big issue then there are load of research available online to do it all.   What you have to do is find a balance that works for you and meets your needs. ,®
t5_2qh0u,banderole,1378237482,"Good question. The truth is this trap doesn't suffocate mice, although you're right to think it would, as that is the number one problem with live-catch traps. Here, let me quote my dad from his [FAQ page on his website](http://teeterpong.com/faqs.html):  *Rodents have a very high respiratory rate and they cannot survive long in enclosed spaces. But live traps can’t have big air holes because rodents would simply chew their way out. Consequently, most live traps are self-defeating, as they end up suffocating rodents and they still pose major health risks. The TEETER PONG!™ has a unique cylindrical shape that solves this problem. All walls of the TEETER PONG!™ are covered in ventilation holes that keep the mouse alive, but because the walls are rounded away from the mouse, the holes can not be reached by teeth.*",™

This does 2 things.  1. If you push fast enough and your support can offer enough ward coverage, you can hit level 2 before Cait does. When this happens, ping your support to follow you in as you all in Cait.  2. This stops Cait from pushing you, never let Cait push you into your turret, she'll just poke you while you try to cs.  Just try to keep your distance and be patient. Sometimes Cait players will try to poke you even when she's not behind minions. If this happens, just hit her with a Q.   Don't. Let. Her. Push.

In college, went on a date with a 2nd year student in my first year. Hit it off, had a great time, took her home and had my way with her. It was college, so of course it was meant to be a casual thing. This was made very clear by her, and me being new to this, thought this was great. No strings, just fun times to be had when she dropped by my place.  3 days later, cut to a similar situation had a great time with a completely new girl. She reminded me a lot of the previous girl personality wise, even looked a little similar so I said to myself 'why not?' and took her home. Had a great time, and yet again, was told that this was more than ok to be a casual thing.   That weekend, girl #1 tells me to meet up with her for drinks. Me, wanting more agrees to this. Tells me she's bringing someone along with her. More the merrier, right? Turns out the extra body that night was girl # 2. Who also happened to be her sister.  At first, I broke out into a cold sweat. For sure I was going to get raked over the coals for this by them both. First comment out of the girl #1's mouth after seeing me walk in?  ""Looks like someone got a Rickard sandwich!"". (their last name.)  Thinking back on it now though... It makes me wonder if they'd done it before. Who does that make the slutty one then?  BONUS MAN WHORING: After being Captain Monogamous™ for about 7 years, I got cheated on, and then dumped. Figured I'd give online dating a go in Toronto. Initially, I though it would be a fruitless endeavour, but it turned out to be anything but. Ended up sleeping with 6 girls in a one week period (two within 24 hours of each other, the rest spread out over the week).   I don't think I slept better after that week was over. ",™

t5_2qh1i,Revelgoodpeople,1378258572,"I have one and only one great and horrifying story.  About 4 months ago I was at my friends house, We've been friends a decent amount of time probably a year or so.  It's about 10 at night, only her and her mother are home. Father works in over night security or something, Idk.  Anyhow after 3 consecutive shots each, my friend and I begin making out, She takes out my dick sucks it, I go down on her and then she gets in the doggy position and we start fucking.   At this point we're both fairly twizzled™ I'm fucking her and then I hear the door open behind me, There stands the mother, I freeze up like a deer in head lights and my friend does the same pulling the covers over her. The mother walks over and gives me 2 options.   1. I can leave and she'll tell her husband. (Daddy is not only a gun enthusiast, but loves his daughter to death).  2. She's going to join us and she won't say a word.   I look at my friend and she decides for me and starts sucking my dick again with the mother undressing in front of me then joins her daughter on the bed swapping spit and sucking my dick.  At this point I'm 2 things, 1 - Fearing for my life, and 2 - the most horny I've ever been.  So Now I have them both right in front of me on the bed in doggy position,  of course I plunge into mama first. I want to please her so I can escape with my life so I'm fucking the shit out of her while I finger the daughter next to her, a good 15 minutes of continuous rock hard effort later, the mother squirts like she hasn't had an orgasm in 20 years. My entire crotch and front of my legs are now dripping, I pull out and think alright, I paid my dues. (Wrong) She demands I fuck her daughter while she watches. So I start fucking the daughter again. Mid hump I two hands on my ass and i feel my cheeks being spread apart.  I'm panicking a little, but it's soon soothed as she begins to lick my ass. Shortly after the daughter cums, I pull my dick out the mother starts sucking me till I cum. Afterward She throws me my pants and tells me to get out asap. I manage to put my boxers on and run out with my shirt / pants in my hand.  TL;DR Life or death mother daughter pussy. ",™

What about time travel? Even with the advanced sci-fi technology of the HL and Portal universes, time travel seems a stretch.  They'll have to make a very good stab at explaining it in real-world terms, and there's the rub: there are almost no real-world terms of time travel. What about the multiverse theory? I think that's our best bet, but Michael Crichton (blessings and peace be upon him) gave it a hell of a college try, and his version leaves a lot of questions. Primarily, how do you create an inter-universe wormhole? But Cave Johnson's audio files (they're super awesome, by the way) ramble extensively about the multiverse. Aperture would have figured out a means to open portals, or wormholes, etc. between Earth and another universe, and the Combine wants that technology why? An alternate route to Earth from the Overworld? That's kinda where I'm stuck.",♥

t5_2qh61,sensoryspinout,1378263806,I beg to differ! My point of view is not nonsense. All those examples you gave are activities that you don't need to do while driving. If you feel the need then pull over. This does not diminish the seriousness of driving drunk. I'm tired of seeing society sinking  into the abyss &amp; getting further away from people taking responsibility for their actions. If you can take a sip of your drink without being distracted that is fine but if you feel the need to stuff your face with a Big Mac ® then pull over or wait until you get to your destination. What would your excuse be to the two &amp; three year olds who mother you just killed? Sorry kids but the secret sauce running down my sleeve &amp; into my lap. Driving is a privilege not a right. Those that cannot abide by the law should be punished according in order to rehabilitate. Each repeat offense should be more severe &amp; if the offender cannot get a handle on it then that privilege should be taken away. My options come my own personal observations nor what the media dishes out. If you knew me you would know I am not one to be spoon fed! SMGDH!,®

I would disagree with you about the Sermon on the Mount, in that Jesus didn't use those texts as clobber verses.  A clobber verse is a verse used to shut down conversation and to (try to) end opposition.  You can clobber a gay person with Leviticus 18:22 or whatever other passage, and walk away feeling righteous and like you really communicated the Truth In Love™ to them.  But I can guarantee you pretty easily that that wasn't what they picked up on.  What they picked up on was you being a judgmental dick that didn't take the time to get to know them or understand them at all, whatsoever, before passing judgment on them.  Let me give you a better example of a clobber verse scenario from the Bible.  It's from [John 8:2-11], where the Pharisees bring a woman accused of adultery to Jesus, with all the righteousness of the Mosaic Law behind them.  Of course, they have every right to *literally* clobber her to death.  And how does Jesus respond?  He says, in verse 11, ""*Neither do I condemn you*"".  Of course, He does call her to leave her life of sin, but that's a call He makes to all people, regardless of their orientation.  ",™

If you have a string `'abc'` of arbitrary encoding, you can convert to ASCII or any other arbitrary encoding with `str.encode`: `'abc'.encode('ascii') =&gt; b'abc'`.  Please note that this method will throw errors when the destination encoding does not have a representation of a source character (for example `'☃'.encode('ascii')` (unicode snowman) will throw an error).  `encode` accepts an optional parameter that can be used to alter this behavior.

When captured with a rolling shutter, these little changes in camera position and orientation result in the the typical CMOS ""wobble"" or ""jello-like"" distortions.  If you lock the frame up in post (read: stabilize it), this wobble will become much more visible, since it's no longer disguised by the camera movements.  On top of that, warp stabilizer in particular can add to this wobble by introducing some degree of distortion by itself.   It's worth noting though that even even with a ""non-warp"" stabilizer, i. e. by just tracking and compensating for global position, rotation and scale, handheld footage from a cheap CMOS device will always show a fair amount of that distortion which is nowadays widely attributed to AE's Warp Stabilizer™.

I feel like I answered ""If my partner is interested"" a lot more than I should've haha :D Some of them where both answers are ""if"" don't really mean much I think (i.e. shaving each other) but others should've been me giving a resounding yes (like rimming you '///v///' if you'd like that).  Also I see you'd like a lot of group and public fun ;D warrants a lot more discussion, as does the rest of the survey. Also feel free to bring up other things I might've said 'no' to, there be no shame here! I mostly said no to things if the idea sounded foreign to me and I completely wasn't sure, but if there's anything you really want to try, we can talk about it.

t5_2qj8u,TheRealFender,1378293381,"Actually the point of midnight wheat is that it is dark w/o much roasted character.  &gt;We specifically developed these two unique black malts so they have no bitter, astringent, dry flavor or aftertaste. Use them in Black IPAs, Black Lagers, Black Ales, Schwarzbiers and other beers for deep, rich color with only hints of subtle roasted flavor.  &gt;Both malts function as a 1:1 replacement to debittered black malt, but with smoother flavor. That's because debittered black malts are made by removing a great deal of the husk (but not all of it). Since it's the husk that develops bitter notes during roasting, debittered black malts will contribute a certain amount of bitter, astringent or dry flavors or after taste to beer.  &gt;Not Blackprinz® or Midnight Wheat which are made from grains with no husk.  &gt;Which one should you use? For a starting point keep in mind that Midnight Wheat Malt is the smoothest source of black color of any malt available. Blackprinz® Malt, meanwhile, delivers color plus more roasted flavor.  http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Products/Bitterless.htm",®

There have been many posts about this and even some CA staff confirming it not working.  I can't find their links as of yet but its likely only a bug that will be cleared up in the future patches.    A possible fix: Open Catalyst control center (right click on desktop).  Then there should be an option somewhere in the menus that will let you set the 8800M to stay on manually.  Remember to turn it off/back to automatic when you're on the battery.  http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/switchable-graphics/Pages/what-is-dynamic.aspx  Note that is says: ""User-initiated switching via AMD Catalyst Control Center™ or control panel""  Unfortunately I have no idea which menu it would be under.

t5_2rbzz,mimefrog,1378299331,"It is very likely Wall Pipe® or Basket Pipe®.    Basically, a wall/basket pipe is a machine made commodity pipe, mass produced in Italy that tobacconists across the country buy for about $7-$10 and sell for $25-$40 (I've seen the price lists at my friend's shop).  They are made from the inferior briar stock the premium manufacturers pass on.  The bowl drilling and stem are often misaligned.  They are also frequently dip stained, meaning the stain is in the bowls so people actually smoke stain if the bowl is not pre-carbonized.  All that said, there are many Dunhill-owning pipe veterans who swear that a wall pipe is among their best smokers.  What really matters is what you like.  If it smokes good for you, rock on.  If you decide you don't like it, maybe try a better made pipe before you decide the hobby is not for you.    ",®
t5_2rfxx,LullabyGaming,1378299650,"While I do like the idea of it, I think it kind of falls off because of the body suit.  A big part of Vi's character is that she isn't sexualized in any way. She has smaller breasts than most female characters, she doesn't reveal any skin aside from her face and as such you know you're going to get beat down really bad. She screams of ""badass"".  With a costume like that it's no longer the case. Now she screams of ""Look I have boobs! Love me!""  I think her body armor should be made in to a golden plate armor so it looks more like Blitzcrank. Currently she just looks like she's wearing Blitzcrank goggles with golden gloves instead of her previous metal colored gloves.  If you really want to add the short jeans to her character, I think you should make her shirt be a tanktop or a T instead of that random piece of cloth you have there.  Or perhaps a short shirt showing a small bit of her stomach with some sort of a short jacket/sleeve.  Vi needs to look tomboyish, now she kind of looks like a street girl with gloves.

t5_2qi0s,jumb0tr0n,1378328780,"""Cassette Hubs It is easy to convert a Shimano cassette Freehub ® for singlespeed use. The simplest way is just to remove the derailers, shorten the chain and thread it onto the chainwheel and rear sprocket of your choice. This is less than ideal, however, because you've got the extra weight of the unused sprockets to deal with, and the chainline will probably be crooked. The sprockets used on multi-speed cassettes are designed for easy shifting, which is not a good thing on a bike that isn't supposed to shift!  The better way to convert a cassette Freehub ® is to remove the 7-, 8- or 9-speed cassette and replace it with a single sprocket. You will also need a bunch of spacer washers to hold the single sprocket in place. You can often get a suitable number of spacers by taking apart a couple of discarded, worn-out cassettes.  Having a single sprocket sandwiched in a stack of spacers makes it easy to get the sprocket properly aligned for perfect chainline with whichever chainwheel you choose to use in front.  You can use one of the old sprockets from your taken-apart cassette, but it you are less likely to have accidental derailment if you use sprockets made for single-gear use. The best choice for this is to use BMX cassette sprockets. These sprockets are quite inexpensive, and are available in a range of sizes. They have taller teeth than sprockets designed for derailer use.""",®

Heck, if they wanted to do something really different than what is in game currently it could be a combat class with a DoH as its precursor, requiring ... I dunno alchemist 30 with perhaps archer 15? Could even have special crafting recipes for it which create reagents for its more powerful abilities (AoE potions and group buffs, oils for ally's weapons, pots of gunk they ground target to create areas of slow or other debuffs for enemies.)They'll likely never do this since its so far out of the pattern they've established but...

Engineer** - If I'm bored with everything else, I generally go engie. At least I can help out my team with a dispenser. It can get a little repetitive though.  **6. Spy** - Spy is one of my most played classes, even though I'm mediocre at best.  **7. Scout** - Gotta go fast. I like scout, but he's fragile and requires pretty good aim (which, generally, I lack) unless you have the element of surprise.  **8.

Later editions of PS don't really add anything to CS4 that comes close to being an improvement.  Everything Adobe considers an improvement, I have 3rd party plug-ins for that are vastly superior.   I have been doing this since retouching a photograph involved spraying a print from your darkroom with a special finish that allowed you to retouch the photograph with an index of 800 colored pencils.   For 10 bucks a month, Adobe can kiss my furry white ass. I'll keep this machine running until the zombie apocalypse. I have a 12-year-old Mac sitting in the same studio that also still works just fine, too.   I have very serious doubts as to whether a subscription-based software will be remotely reliable. That's a very big issue for us. Clients with a deadline could give a shit about your IT issues.   I honestly cannot think of anything good that can come from this weird move. Who the fuck decided this?  *""We have a very successful product that has become the industry standard for professionals and amateurs alike. It's so wildly successful that the name of our program has become a verb! Let's change everything about it in an unprecedented way that will make people doubt our sanity and seriously consider a different product for the first time in 20 years!""*  Who the fuck was at that meeting and said 'Great idea!'?  Business 101: if something is working, just keep it working. Not broken, don't fix it, any other cliche you want to throw out there.   That's just one, I can think of at least 4 more reasons that this is a terrible idea.  I actually looked it up and I still don't believe it. Adobe is actually no longer going to publish any CS software  &gt;[While Adobe Creative Suite® 6 products will continue to be available for purchase, Adobe has no plans for future releases of Creative Suite or other CS products.](http://www.adobe.com/products/cs6.html)  If they want that to be successful, it had better work 100% of the time flawlessly.   EDIT: this also applies to ALL CS software. If you're a photographer, then you probably also use Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks, etc. Is that going to bump that $9.99 up a bit?

I personally know that there are genuinely anomalous, totally unexplainable UFOs. This is not a belief. I have made this determination based on evidence.   I know that with proper research, something extraordinary will be discovered about this phenomenon, and it could change our lives completely. I am convinced of this.  But in the UFO research field, and among enthusiasts for the subject, there are hoards of very silly people, the gullible, the deluded and in some cases the straight up insane. They muddy the waters, fall for hoaxes, build complex belief systems based on nothing more than fictions that are passed along as fact. It creates this massive pile of horseshit that you have to wade through to get to the real data.   If we are to find out anything real concerning this profound mystery the field has to be very strict about evidence and logic, and purge itself of the nonsense that has held back progress for over 50 years.

We could privatize the ocean and sell it off and fence it.  We could privatize the air we breathe and install meters into newborns' lungs the second they are born.  We could privatize and patent the sunny day and charge people for looking at it.  We could install photometers in eveybody's home, forcing them to pay for every ray of sunshine that pierces their windows.  We could sell off the redwood forests, and yellowstone, and the white mountains for pennies on the dollar and fence all hikers out.  We could could charge them quintuple and track their eye motion to bill them for enjoying beautiful vistas®.  And we could damn well force poor kids to go hungry at lunch.    Food is not a human right.  Water is not a human right.  Feeling a cool breeze is not a human right.  Air is not a human right.  Sunlight is not a human right.

t5_2qh0u,tribbing1337,1378399050," What you see here may be my greatest office design to date.  The quiver is mounted under the railing allowing for quick access to the bolts.  The bolts themselves are lightweight, aerodynamic, and with sharp points reinforced with tape to keep them snugly in place after impact. The fletching is made from laminated post its and gives a nice floaty and stable flight.  The safety line you see towards the bottom is marked by a blue twist tie. Once it is gripped by the 2nd trigger, the string won't fly in case the main trigger is accidentally pulled. Also, the blue twisty is attached to the contact point of the main black twisty. This was a surprise 2nd safety design in that, if the main trigger is pulled while the safety is engaged, the weapon will not fire. If somehow the blue safety is pulled after without unloading the bolt, the bolt will fly off in a safe sideways manner, like a slow Frisbee. This is because the safety, while doing nothing but ensuring the bolt will not release on its own, offsets the bow string just enough after the trigger is accidentally pulled that the bolt is at such an awkward position it falls to the ground. I've tested many times this morning. I'm happy with this feature.  Also, the twistys are stronger then the rubber bands I was using for trigger holds and now won't break from extended use.  The paper clip things at the front end of the bow act as a rudimentary sight picture for greater accuracy.  I'm thinking about making some improvements but also thinking I could start over with all the parts laying around here.  Stay tuned for more updates.

This is best, but will be expensive to set up.  $600 for a good build, $200 for each extender (Xbox360).    You can get TIVO, and pay the monthly subscriptions. $15/mo for 1st, and $5 for each extender per month.    Simple.TV and Aereo may also be options, but they just don't run that well and can be slow and cumbersome.    Here is my build for a HTPC: This build gives you the ability to record live TV, automatically remove commercials from the shows you have DVR'd.  Rip Blu-Rays to the hard drive, etc. By far the most full featured, but also the most expensive choice.

I've drafted it quite a few times, changing my deck style each time but it's very, very rare that a deck that isn't running Blue wins. I get that people like M14, but I definitely don't feel it deserves the praise the set gets. When one color is so clearly skewed in terms of power (blue) and another color so clearly skewed in terms of suck (white), I feel like it makes the set unfun. I hate when I get midway through pack 1 and realize: ""Great. There's no U left in these packs and I'm clearly going to be the W player. Oh well.

If you saw that without actually having known that an Elephant is capable of moving at 18-20kph (11mph)...I, looking at the skelton with a non-biased objective based perspective, would have never guessed the elephant was capable of such speeds. Most smaller sized animals at that point (10-15mph) are at a full tilt run/gallop(their actual top speeds being much faster at full capacity)   Now, examine the skelton of [Sue](http://www.cmnh.org/site/Img/AtTheMuseum/Sue/SUEexhibit.jpg). Look at how developed the skeletal structure the pelvis and rear legs are of the Tyrannosaur. With how far the pelvis extends below the hips, you can infer that there are some serious muscle structures attached to that. With the way she is configured in this particular picture, the high-arch of her feet, and the manner that she would be capable of running on the ""balls"" of her feet indicate that she would be capable of bird-like speeds. Now, all of this could just be horribly incorrect, but I think the paleontologists have a preeeettty good idea of what Sue's skeletal configuration was like.  Over millions and millions of years, evolution™ is going to develop this creature, now with all these points mentioned above, we can infer, and again, like the majority of paleontology, this is speculation, I would go out on a limb and say that this big ass, 7-ton killing machine was capable of moving a ta pretty good clip, for hunting the slower, more possibly elephant-like quadrupeds, or bipeds.   edit: forgot a fact-point",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1378426975,"it's time for **RageChat™**  damin returns and proves once again that he is one of the marquee artists of Third-Wave Rage. again what separates him from the lower-tier artists like jared is the inherent believability of the story; it brings to mind the sort of schoolyard antics we all got up to at some point. in some ways we feel like we're a part of damin's life because we're watching him grow up.  despite only just starting school, damin is clearly a RageArtist™ wise beyond his years; there's a lot of sly nods to some of the more damaging behaviour that Second-Wave Rage has engaged in. the repetition of the Fuck Yeah guy in panels 1 &amp; 2 highlights the tendency for SWR artists to overuse that meme when referring to themselves and their friends, which always suggested the artist was trying to imply that they're a better person than they truly are. the ham-fisted suggestion that his friend is ""also cool"" implies that damin himself is cool, which is visually represented by the choice of RageFace™ used. what's important here is that the face has not been presented as a consequence of a positive event; it's simply in damin &amp; ayden's natures to *be* the Fuck Yeah guy. when you couple that with the fact that they're both starting school, the truthfulness of the idea starts to be called into question (can anyone at that age truly be considered cool?) and the nature of the representation becomes evident.  i really like panel 3 a lot; it's rare that we see someone play around with composition to the point where the place themselves into the same panel twice, but damin really executes it well here. again i think the choice of RageFaces™ is important here, we're dealing with some more OU faces and faces that also tend to be used by artists when they wish to add gravitas to their person; the Pfftch face is used whenever OP wants to build anticipation for the ""epic punchline"" and the Yelling Trollface is used as a visual indicator that the joke is being said now, it is funny and you the responder should laugh at it. it's all very self-serving, and the relative zooming of the latter when compared to the former **really emphasises** this idea. of course the joke itself is the sort of puerile garbage that we all thought was funny when we started school, but have since grown out of. by using these faces for that joke damin is highlighting the underdeveloped sense of humour possessed by most artists in the SWR meta, and he does a great job of satirising them.  all of this, topped off by a tastefully done victory panel that reassures me this is indeed a True Story that definitely happened. if damin can keep the quality of his work at this level, he'll be able to solidify his legacy as one of the best RageArtists™ of the TWR movement.  **RageScore™**: 92  **RageChoice™ nominee, September 2013**",™

Typically, such sub-chronic feeding studies are done on young rats, only a week or so old, so they're not more than 14-15 weeks, I would expect.  &gt;Abstract  &gt;_A thirteen week feeding study was conducted by feeding *young adult* male and female Sprague Dawley [Crl:CD®(SD)] rats diets_  So, adults are any time after puberty, which is about 10-11 weeks in SD rats. So, 11 weeks + 13 weeks = 24 weeks.  &gt;What do you think about the fact that there were no tumors in the 4114GLU group?  Impossible to say. There may be no real correlation between the cancers and the rats, or it may be that it is an ""equivocal"" finding.

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1378432771,"&gt; You are still the only person talking about Monsanto. I don't really care about your personal analysis of the widely-accepted form of safety study because you generally don't seem to know what you are talking about. I'm not going to engage you here because nobody has been talking about this.   The use of auxiliary control groups for GMO 90-day rodent toxicity studies is allowed by the OECD 408 protocol. It is ONLY allowed for use with GMOs. If you actually tried to use it for a serious toxicity study, you'd be laughed out of the room, or so I gather from what statisticians say when they look at it.  The study here also uses that same protocol, but with only 3 auxiliary groups instead of 6. Interestingly, they only use 1 dose-level  per group, even though OECD says to use 2. I guess that they believe that 1 dose per sub-type of GMO is sufficient. 1 + 1 = 2, afterall.  See section 2.2 of the original study:  [Thirteen week rodent feeding study with grain from molecular stacked trait lepidopteran and coleopteran protected (DP-ØØ4114-3) maize](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512008642)  &gt;_2.2. Diet formulation, composition, and administration All experimental diets were formulated by Purina Mills, LLC (St. Louis, MO) in accordance with the standards of Purina Mills Labdiet® Certified Rodent LabDiet® 5002 (PMI® 5002; PMI Nutrition International, 2009) and prepared at Purina TestDiet (Richmond, IN). The control diet was prepared with ground 091 maize grain, the test diets with DP-ØØ4114-3 maize grain from glufosinate-treated plants (4114GLU) or untreated plants (4114), and **reference diets with maize grain from 32D78, 33N29, or 34P88 plants**._  An interesting thing is that the study refers to using historical data to evaluate the statistics, which raises the question: why use the auxiliary groups as well?  Ahhh...  When convenient, they use the reference groups instead of the historical data. What a hoot:  &gt;_Group mean potassium (K) was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in female rats from both the 4114 and 4114GLU groups. These statistical differences were also considered to be unrelated to consumption of the test diets and non-adverse as they were minimal in magnitude (94% and 92% of control, respectively) and were not associated with differences in other serum electrolytes (sodium or chloride). **Further all of the individual K values in these groups were within the range of individual values in the control or reference diet groups** (with the exception of 2 rats from the 4114GLU group) and no differences in K values were present in male rats from the 4114 or 4114GLU groups._  So, whatever gives them the best ""statistically insignificant"" finding  --control, historical data, or reference group-- is used in the evaluation of the data.  Run THAT past a standard toxicology study review board and see what they say. LOL",®

t5_2r5lh,ThorinRuriksson,1378440514,"Firstly, I should point out that when it comes to questions like these you'll ask nine different heathens and get ten different answers. So take what I say as a personal opinion, and not the One Truth™.  As for marijuana, my take on it is similar to that of alcohol. Drinking is fine, but know your limits. No one likes a drunk, and one should always have his wits at hand when he needs them. I think marijuana is the same way. Smoke it, chill out a bit, but don't lose your head over it, and don't let it negatively impact your life. If your job prohibits it, then don't use it. If you want to get a job and they test for it, stop using it. And if at any point you consider not applying for a job because they test, perhaps you should think about how much it's affecting you. Like I said, treat it like booze, and I think you'll be okay.  For halucinagens, there are various ideas on that. There is evidence to suggest our ancestors used them in a few instances, from religious rites and rituals to inducing the berserkr frenzy. Cannabis has been found in burials of practitioners of seiðr.   In my *opinion*, hallucinogens (if you use them at all) should be reserved for religious use. I've got no hard evidence to back my opinion, nor historical backing. It's just how I feel about the nature of hallucinogens and what they do to our minds. I feel they open us in ways that are not suitable for a nights fun. But then, that's just me.   **EDIT:** Something I forgot to say because part of me feels like I shouldn't have to. One thing to remember about our ancestors is that we were a people of laws, so make sure you understand the laws in your area about these things. If there is a law, follow it. If you feel that that law shouldn't be, fight to change it. But one thing you should never do is ignore a law altogether.  ",™

t5_2qn3h,mikeyur,1378446528,"Okay, so I just took a look at your site. I'm not sure how much Cloudflare would help, because your site is really image heavy. The homepage alone is about 6.4MB to download.. which, even on a decent connection would still take 7-10 seconds to fully load.  Ideally, you'd want to cut that down as much as possible. You should run your images through an 'image optimizer' - on Mac I use 'ImageOptim' (free), there are a bunch on windows and some web-based ones like Smush.it (by Yahoo). It takes out the meta data and other stuff without hurting the image quality, on logos and stuff I can save 60%+ of the file size.  Your images are only displaying at 200px wide on the homepage, but the actual images are over 265px wide. I would take all the images and resize them, then re-upload the new set to use on the homepage. You'll save on bandwidth and cut down on load times.  If you can, try to remove images from the front page - or hide them behind another click. You can also look at 'lazy loading' - which basically only loads the part of the page someone is looking at, and as they scroll it'll continue to load.  A proper CDN (something like MaxCDN, CDNify or CloudFront) can really help, but it can also get expensive pushing 3TB of bw. Much more than you're paying now. You may want to consider a GhettoCDN™ such as Flickr. Get a Flickr Pro account, upload the images, and link to them from your site. This will help take the load off your server, save you a bunch of bandwidth and help stuff load faster since it'll be loading from Flickr's CDN.  Re: site slowing down. Check out your max connections in your apache config. There's a default setting on how many connections the server will keep active, you can probably up this a lot, and the server should be able to handle it. Other option is using something like Varnish caching, which will keep your pages in memory, and serve them up a lot faster.  PM me if you want me to take a closer look.

t5_2qi4s,Solo_Virtus,1378447291,"&gt;Go back and watch it.   Ok!  * *watches it* *  &gt;Where both of them together and certainly Qui-Gon alone couldn't get the upper hand on Maul, Obi-Wan becomes a dervish of AngrySaber™ and chops Maul's saber in two, knocks his ass down, and generally starts kicking much more ass than the Boys in Burlap had been able to do up to that point.  I think perhaps you should go back and watch the *entire* fight sequence. Qui-Gon actually *did* seem to maintain the upper hand for the great majority of his solo duel with Darth Maul (I'm speaking of their exchange from the moment Obi-Wan gets separated from Qui-Gon, well before they enter the energy shaft room).  The only reason they end up in that room at all is because Darth Maul is on the prolonged defensive and in backpedalling retreat versus Qui-Gon.  Likewise, you mention how whirlydervish ""Dark Side"" Obi-Wan manages to knock Darth Maul down, but you choose to ignore that calm-and-collected Qui-Gon does so as well (to much greater efficacy, actually, Maul falls like four stories):  http://i.imgur.com/krWIErZ.gif  Furthermore, it is worth noting that Qui-Gon (more than) held his own against Darth Maul singlehandedly for a collective duel time of about **1 minute and 20** seconds (I counted).  And for the great majority of that time Darth Maul was on the defensive and retreating.  Obi-Wan, for all his whirly-birdy angry dervishing, only lasted about **30 seconds**.  So ultimately your argument that Obi-Wan was a more effective duelist because he temporarily ""embraced the dark side"" really doesn't hold water.  Even if you choose to claim that Obi-Wan was a better fighter post-Qui-Gon evisceration, really a bunch of reasons why could be rationalized.....perhaps Darth Maul was momentarily taken aback by Obi's sudden hitherto-unseen aggressiveness....maybe Darth Maul was feeling extra smug after killing a Jedi and was simply *toying* with Obi-Wan (there *are* quite a few cocky little flourishes going on there)...  Or maybe Obi-Wan was less cautious (and thus more effective) without his Master basically looking over his shoulder, or his fighting style is more efficient without a partner (didn't Obi basically suck anytime we see he and Anakin fighting as a duo?)  It's basically moot, though, because Obi-Wan still ***loses*** the duel.  (The trick at the end doesn't count in my opinion.  [Just like Qui-Gon's duel at the end of *Rob Roy*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27M5KWI_q50&amp;t=5m00s), when Darth Cunningham clearly has him bested, but dies because he doesn't immediately dispatch his disabled opponent).    Maybe Obi-Wan would have actually done *better* had he meditated and remained calm.  Would a more collected and less angrily aggressive Obi-Wan have walked nose-first into a point blank force push?  I dunno.  Doubt it.  &gt; If he was summoning calm and serenity, there would have been some sort of sequence where he closed his eyes and some strain of a calm Jedi-ish motif would play through the score a'la Luke in the wampa cave.  But there *was*.  You can clearly hear the serene Jedi theme start to play right as Obi-Wan is about to pull the maneuver.  In fact it is the exact same music that plays in the wampa cave scene!  So clearly the writer intended the scene to evoke that moment, i.e. our hero has his back against the wall and, instead of panicking or embracing emotion (the essence of the dark side), he calms his mind and becomes the force.  I hate to break the fourth wall here, but I think Obi-Wan looking angry at that moment is more a matter of poor acting/misunderstanding the scene rather than what you are intimating.  Anyway you're missing the point.  When Yoda tells Luke that the dark side isn't ""more powerful,"" he almost certainly isn't only (or at all) referring to something as banal and lowbrow as swordplay.  Obviously he's more interested in teaching Luke (and us) a more holistic lesson about the nature of the universe.  If a Jedi's power or worth rested solely or primarily in the art of the duel, Yoda would have been fencing with Luke, not philosophizing with him.",™

t5_2ug10,zpridgen75,1378448340,"mosa curity posts are of a roaming variety. my post instructions are to stand at the front door and not move unless needed. also I am better equipped to deal with disorder. aside from my 9 millimeter service pistol I carry four spare magazines a large canister of OC spray a collapsible baton several pairs of zip cuffs and i wear a IIIA ballistic vest. my main piece of equipment is known as a stun shield. it is a concave Lexan© riot shield with metal strips on the front that act as a large surface stun gun. I also wear a mask and mirrored sunglasses. just making eye contact with one of these protesters is enough to whip them into a frenzy. I can feel my face because the last thing I want is one of these people to recognize me while I'm at Walmart.  the funniest thing I have seen would have to be some random kid, that comes by every few days to protest the protesters. He holds up sighs that say ""im just here for the hippy pus*y"" or ""i dont care about abortion, i just like signs"".  protesters are constantly presenct on this property as is there right. however sometimes they have a habit of getting out of hand. One time i was rushed by a group of 5-6 angry protesters and hit everyone of them with one sweeping spray of OC.   sometimes upon taking my post I find gifts that the protesters have left for me. Some examples would be a four pack of Red Bull what the Bible verse taped to it, or a 6 pack of water, with an invitation to some church. on the other end of that spectrum some protesters have gone so far as taping death threats and see what I can only describe to be subversive literature to the walls of my post describing how I am one of Satan's soldiers protecting the wicked. all in all I could care less I have absolutely no emotional standpoint on abortion as I do not have a uterus.

It’s true that he doesn’t believe one can begin from a presuppositionless philosophical standpoint—since, as an existentialist, he is reacting to the Enlightenment conception of Reason™—but that’s hardly the same thing. (He’s also not an irrationalist or a fideist, another common misconception.)  Incidentally, if you’re serious about exploring his philosophical merits, even from a non-theist perspective, you might benefit from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1ecrsu/what_can_atheists_get_out_of_reading_kierkegaard/).",™

You will discover dangerous foes in the form of extraterrestrials, robots, mutants, or the genetic experiments of the past.

t5_2s8ms,hmbemis,1378491068,"By coincidence the gas company rep just called me and gave me new info...   It's $500 to hook up, but they won't do it until I have a conversion plan from a plumber who needs to specify BTUs and meter placement.    Once I have the hook up, they will give me account number and then I can apparently get something called a ""HEAT Loan"" which is 0% for 10 years to pay for high efficiency equipment...  The only &gt;90% boilers they offer on their discount list are: ""Burnham Alpine Forced Hot Water ENERGY STAR® HE Stainless Steel Condensing"".  They have 80K, 105K, 150K and 210K models.  I think my current boiler is about 105K IIRC, so I should be able to find something.  The discounted price after rebates for the boiler ends up being about $1500.  How much would I expect to pay for a plumber to install a new boiler and do the gas piping from a new meter?  I was estimating 2 days and 2 men, so about 32 hours.  They're about $100-125/hr around here.  I'd also need the PVC run for combustion intake and exhaust and some piping to dump the condensate pump, etc... I'm guessing at least $3000-5000 for the labor and misc. parts associated with boiler replacement.  Plus more more to remove the old oil tank (which happened to get topped off in late spring, so it's completely full now)  I'll call a few guys in for estimates, but I think I'm looking at about $5000-7500 job, assuming the actual gas line cost is the $500 they claimed...   I have been on the fence about selling the place... I'm guessing that new heating system (vs. 9-10 years old), plus removal of the liability of the old tank (it will be flagged at inspection for sure) will be worth at least a few grand (one way or the other) at the bargaining table during a sale.  In the meantime I think I will save $750-1000/season vs. the $4/G for oil I'm paying now, so hopefully pay back in 5-10 years.  I would probably plan to NOT convert my hot water now since the electric tank is fairly new and working fine.  I also would not convert my stove or dryer because they're both ~3 years old... so just heating system replacement.  I'd love to do the forced air conversion so that I can ultimately get a/c, but the idea of piling an additional $10K for ducting... there's no way to recoup that, it would be a matter of personal comfort or convenience only... despite being ugly as hell, I'd rather just go mini-splits for $10K.",®

In 2010 Dr. Henry White of Haynes International ""provided a cost estimate of $2 M to perform the testing necessary to get Hastelloy® N into Section 3 of the ASME BPVC and indicated that Haynes currently has extensive data that already can be used to support the code case."" [reddit!](https://web.ornl.gov/fhr/documents/FHR_Workshop_Summary.pdf)  Can you make sense of these two statements together?   What is section 3 of AMSE BPVC?  Is it that Hastelloy N might be good enough to be qualified, but we don't know, and $2m in testing might get us there?  That seems like an awfully small barrier.  I've heard of Hastelloy X and Hastelloy XR, which are apparently similar to Hastelloy N, but in some way different to deal with neutron damage and tellurium cracking.  Are these potential solutions or just more research dead ends?  More broadly, is it even possible to develop materials resistant to fission products, temperature, and neutron flux, without being in a nuclear facility?

t5_2qmox,Gene_P00le,1378514969,"&gt;You are conflating the word colloquial use of the word ""steal"" with the actual crime of theft. That's a rhetorical tactic and it has nothing to do with the substance of the discussion.   actually, maybe we're having different discussions then, because to me, that *is* the discussion. Additionally, I am not doing the conflation, it is you every time you use that word in relation to digital piracy.  Copying is not theft. It never has been, never will be. filsharing is not stealing, in any moral or legal capacity. If you're using the term ""stealing"" as short form for ""committing copyright infringement"" then either a) you've bought the propaganda, 2) you're deliberately confusing the two for the purposes of disinformation, or ☺) you're lazy/retarded, your pick. See Dowling v. United States, and I'll thank you to stop conflating the two from this point on.  &gt;So if I lend out copies of the mp3s that I legally download to friends/neighbours/peers, this should therefore not be illegal?  &gt;Sure, so long as you pay for all the copies, why not?   I'm sorry, I don't understand. Why's that? If I've bought the original, why can't I loan it out to a friend or family? How is that different from a lending library, as discussed above? I mean, let's set aside for the moment the ""because the law says etc etc"" and talk about the actual theory behind copyright, and the limitations therein, as I am extremely curious to hear your justification of such a limit on property rights, since you seem to be such a proponent of it for some reason.  &gt;Abandon recording and go back to the dark ages, in other words. Is that the official Pirate Party recommendation for self-interested artists?   No, that is my own personal recommendation. If you are that concerned about leaking of copies, the only rational solution is to ensure there are no copies to leak. As soon as you publish, you lose all control over it, realistically speaking.  Please note that, although I am a member of the Pirate Party, this does not make me their spokesman, any more than your average republican represents the GOP in all that they say and do. I do not hold a position of power in any party, and chose the tag as it was flair available for this reddit. ",☺

Well, macro cycling is there to aid you in getting all you need to survive during a cut while *fucking moderation in the ass®*^[1](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/03/cheat-mode-the-official-guide/) — eg: three days you get way less fats than you need but you load up on carbs, four days you get way less carbs than you need but you load on fats. Makes adhering to the cut easier. Eating big meals does that, too.  When bulking you don't need all this over-complication, you just eat at a surplus and get what you need (and more) every day. Sure you can fat-cycle and carb-cycle if you want, but why should you?

After this comment (aka the one above yours) we paused and talked about it a lot more and had a honest, open, more personal forum on stuff. Lines have been redrawn and I've come to terms yet again with the fact that my insecurities often get the better of me.   I also really like this quote: &gt; *""Your true self can be known only by systematic experimentation, and controlled only by being known.""*  And thank you so much for that last link! I read through the first one, skimmed through the second, and almost skimmed through the third before pausing. I've always identified as an insecure person, the same way someone might describe themselves as shy, and I only just realized now that it gave it a sticking sense of permanence within my mind. I've always been the one to say that one's personality is dynamic, and I fully understand habitual behaviors and reinforcement. I'm a slave to comfort though. The fact that ""uncomfortable"" was repeated at least four times near the end was super helpful though.  This entire day has been a day of self discovery.

t5_2qhwp,Juuel,1378566113,"**Tomb Raider**  My expectations weren't very high due to some of the footage that had surfaced pre-release. My first impressions weren't much higher as the first ten minutes are spent in a cave full of *Epic, cinematic moments where you press a button and something awesome happens™*! When I finally got out of that damn cave the very next thing I see is a fallen log right above a waterfall with dramatic camera angles and all that jazz ([seen here](http://youtu.be/4oUNJ_XnGbo?t=36s)). Naturally the first thing I did was try to fall off the log and guess what? You can't do it! It doesn't matter how much you try to move to the side, you can't do it. I would understand if this was the easiest difficulty, but I was playing on the hardest setting. Things like this irrititate me to no end: why on earth do you need more cinematic trickery to make a situation seem difficult when you could do it with the gameplay?  Once I got over the log and the following narrow ledge you can't fall off of, the game actually gave me some time to breathe and explore the environment. While it wasn't a huge area, the change of pace was certainly welcome. I'm the kind of player who wants to explore every nook and cranny and in these small hub areas the game serves that well. There are several kinds of different items hidden in these hubs and searching for them in my opinion was the best part of the game. Unfortunately these hub areas are tied together with more linear sections where you have to advance deeper into the island (shoot people), find your friends (shoot people) and grow into a stronger person (shoot more people). The first deer Lara kills is followed by whimpers and shock, but just slightly later Lara has become an unstoppable killing machine which is evident when listening to the conversations of the baddies. I do understand that Lara is going through some dramatic events and is changing as a person but using that kind of a story line in a third-person shooter is far from fitting. The change is way too sudden, I'm guessing the developers tried to ease the transition by having Lara talk to herself as to seem like Lara still needed encouragement, but the way it comes across is that Lara cannot shut up.	  I wasn't too impressed with this game, at parts it just felt like developers trying to fulfil a checklist the publishers handed to them. Individual parts work for better or worse on their own: there's some exploration with a lot of collectibles, some fairly run-of-the-mill third-person action, there are cinematic setpieces, there are QTEs, there's even a multiplayer mode which I never played because who seriously gives a shit. Arkham Asylum, Uncharted and Gears of War in one I guess? However, this game certainly is not the sum of its parts. Those who prefer exploration over action are not going to be satisfied with the amount of shooting, those who just want a Gears of War are going to be somewhat interrupted by quieter moments, people who wanted tomb raiding get a stunning number of 5 or so small tombs with a single, easy puzzle where you don't even get to see the treasure. It has its moments depending on what you like the most but in the end is a pretty forgettable product.    **Bioshock: Infinite**  I had never played a Bioshock game before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I hadn't really followed the buzz and hype around the game, other than that it had gotten really good reviews. After completing the game I am pretty perplexed with these reviews, what exactly was so revolutionary about this game? It's a first-person shooter in pretty environments. It has little gameplay ideas of its own: it has skylines which were okay to toy around with, then there's the pulling of items from other dimensions and... what else exactly? The special powers weren't particularly exciting. Gee, what should I pick, the damage+stun which is made of crows or the damage+stun that is made of electricity! Undertow (knock enemies back aka off platforms) was  probably the only one that was amusing to play with, but that's like the last vigor you get a couple of hours before the end of the game!   So what is especially terrible is that the combat takes like 80% of the game! I would've wanted to explore more of the  world, I mean a city in the sky, that sounds like a weird place! It's too bad that the city feels completely empty, and when  there are non-hostile people in it, the vast majority of them ignore you completely. There were a couple of exceptions like getting  in front of a photographer but a couple of reactions aren't enough. Also the moment someone starts shooting everyone just  disappears in a flash or at least transform into suicidal guards. So, once you've shot all the guards, you can finally explore  the place in peace. It's just a shame that there isn't all that much to be found. You have some small food items, money, a couple of safes opened by lockpicks and then you have audiologs which people just leave lying around, being the primary way the characters are given personality. I thought that was reasonable enough in Rapture because the place was run-down and a lot of the smaller characters were either dead or crazy. However, in a supposedly lively place as Columbia why not utilise, well, actual people talking? 	 Also, similarly to Tomb Raider, Infinite has a segment which really annoyed me. The game treats the player as an idiot and doesn't really give the option to fail. I'm talking about the scene where [Bioshock: Infinite &amp; Spec Ops: The Line Spoiler](#s ""Booker takes part in a lottery and gets to throw a ball at an interracial couple. First of all, the game gives you two button prompts: Press X to throw at the couple, press Y to throw at the announcer! I mean fucking what? In the rest of the game almost all you do is point the crosshair at a person and  press shoot, but in this scene the player is assumed to be so dumb that they might not understand that they can decide where to  throw the ball! It just lacks all subtlety. What if in the scene in Spec Ops: The Line, where you have to disperse a crowd by shooting at the crowd or in the air, two button prompts were included? The game treats the player like an idiot. The racism of the society is  thrown in the face of the player, oh gee, these people sure are racist, as if the game is afraid the player doesn't understand it.  Well, what does the game do with it's racism themes? Nothing, really. The place is just very evil and you have to shoot everyone and  escape with Elizabeth."") 	 There's also a scene where Booker is outside a statue way way up, but surprise, there is no actual risk of falling.  There's a small fence preventing player stupidity. Instead of making the segment actually dangerous by making the player balance on a narrow road, the game has Booker say 'oh wow I am so high up I sure don't want to fall'. I guess I'm just rambling here  but the game was just frustrating to me, they had created a really cool setting and they didn't go anywhere with it. I did not enjoy playing Bioshock: Infinite at all, but I decided to give Bioshock a go as I already had bought it on sale some time ago.    **Bioshock**  I've written quite a bit so far so I won't go into detail too much. First of all, what a terrible port. I spent like an hour trying to make the game playable on PC, in the end I somewhat succeeded but blerh. At least Bioshock: Infinite was a good, functional PC port. So now that's out of the way, I have to say I preferred  Bioshock 1 over Infinite. I don't know how weird this sounds but Rapture felt more alive than Columbia ever did. I'm not entirely  sure what causes that feeling, perhaps it was because the enemies in Rapture were former inhabitants of the city instead of just magically appearing guards? Also there were more things to do. You could actually return to previous areas to end any unfinished business  such as Big Daddies, you had to avoid security cameras, you could hack cameras and robots, you could find a door where you had  to manually input a code you earlier heard from an audiolog and such.  	 Especially the special powers actually felt special. You actually had to utilise a certain plasmid to advance, for example,  melting ice with incinerate, grabbing a key hanging from an out-of-reach wall with Telekinesis, heck, you could even hypnotize a  Big Daddy! The feel of different weapons was better in Infinite but combat in general was more interesting in Bioshock. Perhaps  there was too much hacking, or at least, there should've been another minigame or ability altogether, but it's certainly better than Infinite's... nothing. In the end, most of the time I was entertained but it's not worth the huge reputation it seems to have. I've played better games this year alone.  _______________________________________________  All in all, of the three games, I most enjoyed Bioshock, Tomb Raider had its moments but was too unfocused and bland, and BioShock: Infinite was mostly a frustrating, missed opportunity. Bioshock 20 hours played, Bioshock Infinite 14 hours played, Tomb Raider  18 hours played, one as complete as possible playthrough, although some of those numbers might have idle time included.  EDIT: edited some worst rambliness   	",™

t5_2s48x,ImProbablyHigh1,1378584317,"After watching a lot of the development since early beta I have come to the conclusion that the tech for PS2 is ground breaking this would include things like the server cluster coding and the lighting engine... but the quality of everything else is pretty lacking. Weapon design, Vehicle Design, UI design, and the coding done to support all these has just been really sub par from the get go and still is. The World Design team seems pretty talented as Hossin clearly shows but I don't think the PTS version will make it to live because they will need to ""optimize"" it. remember the game has to be able to run butter smooth on  CPU : x86-64 AMD “Jaguar”, 8 cores   GPU : 1.84 TFLOPS, AMD next-generation Radeon™ based graphics engine    They have been able to bring us massive scale combat but at the large price of having to have very bland base,vehicle and charter design to get it to run.   The major thing saving the game right now is that there is no other game on the market that offers the huge battles on massive maps. I expect the market to be flooded with F2P ""copy cats"" with in the next year or so.Some that will push the envelope beyond what PS2 offers. Sometime soon a company will develop a massive scale combat game that will have as much detail as a battlefield 3/4 map with rebuild-able environments and will not be limited with the console overhead. PS2 on the PC will look very dated at this point. I thank SoE for pushing the envelope but others will take this ball and run with it soon. This is the way of technology and game development. It's competition for your time and money that pushes companies and though this meat grinder may suck for the companies and their development teams it is awesome for us.   SoE will have a head start and will retain people because of the insane grind to get to BR100 (If your not boosted don't even try)but right now a lot of people are simply still here because there is no competition. There is no where to go for massive scale combat so they gloss over things that would normally make them rage quit. This will not always be the case.",™

t5_2qo5v,atimholt,1378596014,"A consideration might be to consider what sense you want the phrase to have. Is ‘abolish death’ imperitive? Then the verb should end in ‘u’. If you want to say something with the same sense as ‘to abolish death’, something like ‘Por’ might be appropriate.  Mortigu Morton? Perhaps too agressive.  Abolicii is apparently a direct tranlation of ‘to abolish’, let’s check an Esperanto language dictionary:  &gt; abolici/i = aboli  and  &gt; abol/i ⚖ (tr) Per oficiala akto nuligi aŭ forigi aranĝon aŭ kutimon: sklaveco estis abolita en Usono nur en 1865.    — [vortaro.net](http://vortaro.net)  “By official act, to nullify or take away an arrangment or custom: slavery was *abolita* (abolished) in the U.S. just in 1865.”  Which is kinda the same meaning as ‘abolish’. I guess.  So maybe (this is my pick):   *Por aboli morton*  or:   *Abolu morton*  But I am far from fluent. Anyone who feels more an expert is free to correct anything I’ve said.",⚖

t5_2qixx,TLBG,1378598442,"So sorry to hear your dx. I too was dx with NHL stage 3b. Was started on R-CHOP but currently on maintenance Retuximab every 3 months after 8 rounds of the R-CHOP. I don't want to scare you because everyone is different when it comes to this, but I felt awful then and have never regained my energy back. It has been almost 2 years since starting tx. I felt like I was hit by a Mack truck and each time I had tx the cumulative effects became worse FOR ME.  I lost all my long blonde hair about 2 weeks after first tx but I never shave it off. It came in dark and curly which was a shocker. Went thru instant menopause--wish I was forewarned--and frustrated. Alot of bloodwork done and repeats done just before chemo because my counts were too low to safely continue or i would be there for tx and told I still couldn't have it. It was compounded for me as I also suffer from a rare neuromuscular disease which made everything worse I think and wonder if I will ever feel ok. I still sleep about 20 hours a day. Cannot taste much. But I am alive. I just want to live life soon. Talk to others and listen to your Dr.  Accept help from others and listen to your body. Some people can work thru chemo but remember everyone is different and you will hear it alot. Stay positive. I never lost alot of weight even when extremely nauseas or when I had canker sores all the way down my throat etc. I just ended up with all the side effects possible but its unlikely you will. Just remain positive and deal with things as they come. It will end and you will feel better. PM me if ever you need to talk or ask me a question. Good luck. 😀",😀

It'll also change again around 25 as our hormones start shifting and changing as we finish up developing our bodies.  What I do if I don't want to have sex but I REALLY want to keep my guy happy... even if I don't want to at first, but giving him pleasure makes me want to actually do it, give him the best blow jobs ever.  I went off my BC pills and learned to deal with PMS (I actually had PMD) I'd have a piece of chocolate or drink chocolate milk, take Midol, go for walks even if I dint feel like it, let my bf know I'm having these premenstrual symptoms which would also help him deal with it or just leave me be.

t5_2rvlj,applesandumbrellas,1378622705,"☂  Yer, definitely! And one of the things I think is awesome about you is how open you are to new ideas in a general sense. Tradition and things can obviously be important to keep us anchored, but it's also important to be willing to branch out from that if that's what makes people/us happy.  I really don't think it's true though that it has to be a dichotomy between insecurity and bigheadedness though. Usually, the latter is just a manifestation of the former where one tries to hide their insecurity by fronting the opposite. I think a truly secure person also can tend to be a very humble person. And yer, I understand that. But I think you can more think of it that I can help show to you the awesome things about yourself, independent of any connection to me.  Yer of course. And I think regardless of envelope-pushing, the most important thing is communication. I think our problem at that stage was not being clear about our feelings and how we dealt with other people and things like that. If we have that, any jealousy etc. can be understood and dealt with.  Yer I did to some extent. A little bit. Some scanning. I think it'se helpful. I've read some literature like that before. I also think the part where they mention that some jealousy can in fact be warranted is important too. Do you think it has any particular applicability to anything we've been talking about?  Haha okay :) Sounds good. Do you want to have more drunk sex then? I think we lose a little inhibition if we do. That's when you first told me about your MFM fantasy ;).

t5_2qh33,Erdumas,1378624498,"The problem is that ""No Parking on Tuesdays"" is actually an equivalence statement (biconditional), ""No parking if, and only if, it is Tuesday"". But the statement on the sign is presented strictly as a conditional ""if you can read this, then you aren't a train"".  These two statements have different logical meanings. For clarity, we'll use the biconditional ""No parking [iff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iff) Tuesday"" and contrast it against the conditional ""No parking if Tuesday"". In both the conditional and biconditional case, if today is Tuesday, then parking is not allowed. We can also conclude in both cases that if parking *is* allowed, it is not Tuesday (note, we can't conclude which day of the week it is; it might be Flargday, which sadly does not exist).   But now things get different. For the *bi*conditional case, if today is *not* Tuesday (maybe Wednesday, maybe Flargday), then parking *is* allowed (double negative, it's not not allowed). Also in the biconditional case, if parking is not allowed, then it's Tuesday.   For the conditional case, if today is not Tuesday, parking may be allowed, or it may be restricted; we don't know from the information given. Similarly, if parking is not allowed, it may be Tuesday or it may be Flargday; we don't know from the information given.   A truth table can help us out (D for ""is Tuesday"", P for ""can Park"" (so ¬P is ""not can Park"", that is, ""can't Park""), → is the conditional, ↔ is the biconditional)       D | P | D → ¬P | D ↔ ¬P |        -------------------------        T | F |   T    |   T    |        T | T |   F    |   F    |        F | F |   T    |   F    |        F | T |   T    |   T    |    Notice how the first two rows of the conditional and biconditional columns agree, while the second two rows differ. Essentially, this entire conversation is about those last two rows in the truth table.",↔

If you looked at an English dictionary (i.e. one from England. I hate the term ""British English"" - it's just ""English"", the original one; all other variants are just cheap copies!) you'd find a definition such as:  [Subway](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/subway):      (British English)     a path that goes under a road, etc. which people can use to cross to the other side  [Car](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/car):      (also British English formal motor car) (North American English also automobile)     a road vehicle with an engine and four wheels that can carry a small number of passengers  [Tube](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/tube):      underground railway     (also The Tube™) [singular] (British English)     the underground railway system in London  [Carriage](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/carriage):      (also coach) (both British English) (North American English car) [countable]     a separate section of a train for carrying passengers  &gt; Looks like the silly british term is less correct than the American term.  That's **B**ritish.  Also, it's only less correct if you're on the west side of the Atlantic.

Like yer yer I agree, we're both open to new ideas! Open-minded and fun-lovin' and mindful, heyo.   I don't think it's a true dichotomy either, but my behavior says otherwise. Been living in cognitive dissonance for a while I suppose. Either that or my insecurities are blowing my ""bigheadedness"" out of proportion, or the other way around. Whatever it is, I know whatever humility other people see in me is not me truly taming my ego and modestly respecting my own talents, but rather me truly believing in what my insecurities say about me. Don't quite know if that makes sense. But rah thank you! Exactly.  Yeah, we were still tiptoeing around each other a bit I guess. Unavoidable in a first relationship such as this. We were still growing and getting to know each other more and more and it was a learning experience to be had. We know better now and we can still keep learning along the way.   Yeah I scanned mostly too. Weren't you the one who told me you rarely ever scanned any literature in front of you? ;P hahajustkidding but rawr no of course everything's multifaceted and looking at something in only one way is never the right answer so yer. me gusta.

We apologize for any confusion, but we changed our Bacopa Gold formulation almost 8 months ago featuring the clinically-proven BacoMind™ Bacopa extract, which not only complies with the USP standard for purity, but also features the entire spectrum of beneficial compounds in Bacopa, collectively known as Triterpene Glycosides, that have been shown in clinical research to support cognitive health.  In fact, each vegetarian capsule of our Bacopa Gold product contains the therapeutic dosage of 225 mg of BacoMind™ along with 275 mg of Bacopa extract standardized to 20% Triterpene Glycosides. We believe that this synergistic blend offers consumers the benefits that the 9 bioactive compounds in BacoMind has to offer along with the glycosides delivered by the Bacopa 20% extract.  We have made repeated requests to Amazon.com to update the product description to reflect the changes with no success - the inconvenience caused to you as a result is deeply regretted.

t5_2smr1,DexNA,1378686457,"Landing a working rover on the Mun, the Hard Way™:  * First off, I suck at designing rovers, I was frustrated by how they refused to budge when I was testing them in the spaceplane hangar, fed up, I made one with the giganto wheels and it tested well.  * Design a rocket to get two of those rovers into orbit, I lack the thrust and fuel to do much else, so I had to park it and get it refueled. Since it went up with a Skipper, I thought I'd try to swap out with a set of nuclear engines.  **NOW BEGINS THE PROBLEMS**  * Despite multiple quicksaves and such, no matter what I did two of the engines would always tear off, thus making this exercise pointless.  * I decide 'screw it, the Mun's not that far' and take this wobbly flustercuff off to it's destination. We get into orbit over the Mun, here was where the rover was supposed to detach and go down under it's own power.  * Since I'd used a stack decoupler instead of a docking port (I wanted the engine gone after touchdown) it couldn't power itself down to the surface even if it wanted to. *quicksave*  * Decide to take this monstrosity down like I do the landers, can't get it to slow down nearly quick enough to salvage crew and rovers. *quicksave*  * In a gesture of anger I chose to just kill it's speed while at full orbit to lawndart the whole mess, but it turned out it was working, so I ran with it. Slowly drop down from 200KM, everything's going smoothly. 500m from surface we run out of fuel. *craaaaaaaap!*  * Despite hitting the Munar surface at ~50m/s, both rovers survived, though one lost a wheel and was flipped over. Luckily since I saw that issue arising, the cockpit was installed upside down so the little kerbal could easily leave in such a circumstance.  * He boards the other rover and those two set out to the destination that I had picked out to explore. A good 2KM before it we get caught in a deep crater and can't get the speed or tracking to get out. *loud native and foreign swears*",™

t5_2qh13,omdufro,1378701698,"What Syria does is Syria's business. A chemical attack is horrific and worthy of condemnation (if it even happened), but unless they start lobbing ICBMs at us or decide to park a fleet off our coast, there is no imminent threat, and therefore no grounds for Dear Leader to leap-frog Congress and plunge America into yet another war.  I wouldn't worry about our involvement in Syria, though - Obama tends to get what he wants, legal or not, and right now, it looks like that's our... *ahem*... *intervention*. You know... for democracy.   Honestly, I'd like to know how we've got all the money in the world for this little adventure, yet our coffers are bone-dry when it comes time to fund education and healthcare - among other things - here at home. The rest of the civilized world can do it, so why not us, the Greatest Country on Earth™?

Homes are not necessarily houses. OP is mixing them up. Apartment and townhouse sale prices are flat, showing a little seasonal variation, and below the peak which occurred spring '12. They really haven't changed much over the last two years.  Detached houses show an increase and an increasing trend, but remain below the peak. There is a seasonal variation - January is a bad time to list, and an obviously cherry picked data point to compare against.  The overall residential average (combined detached, apartment, and townhouse) sales also are flat. All sales remain below a year ago.   The real estate companies put out this to puff up listings at a time when sales normally start decreasing - the beginning of the rainy season. ",®

t5_2fwo,moor-GAYZ,1378722171,"&gt; That's quite heavy. I'd rather implement higher-level languages directly on top of hardware that has been designed for them.  I thought your point was that there are these functional languages that are designed from, like, the idea of how programming should be done, not how the hardware can execute the program, but they are unpopular because people really care about languages being efficient which they aren't on the current hardware.  Except there's a shit-ton of more or less slow languages used to implement the vast majority of software today despite not being optimized for hardware and vice versa in any meaningful way. Surprisingly though they are not exactly The Right Thing™ either!  Btw, a fun fact: reddit was initially written in LISP, then about six months later one of the guys spent a single weekend rewriting in Python 80% of the functionality the four of them had produced during that entire time, so they switched and never looked back. Performance was not among the reasons.  &gt; Should be much simpler, and possibly more efficient. For instance, we can see this in garbage collection.  No, pointer tagging is a dumb hack inherited from dynamically typed languages, static field maps are not that complicated and are superior performance-wise.   &gt; Anyway, hardware is still first in our industry. There's simply no escaping X86 and ARM for personal computing today.  Who cares? You are deluding yourself if you believe that the lower levels are restricting what you can or can't do on the higher level. That's the same pointless bikeshedding as complaining about XML being too complicated, inefficient, and inelegant. Who the fuck cares, efficient parsers and transparent compression are already written and that shit is not a bottleneck for you anyway, shut up and go write some motherfucking code!",™

t5_2qio8,camfunction,1378743979,"**General**  ***New Raid: Siege of Orgrimmar***  The tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream’s arrogance have reached a boiling point with the devastation unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Now it’s time for leaders of the Alliance and Horde to lay siege to Hellscream’s capital and topple the ruthless Warchief once and for all!  Siege of Orgrimmar contains 14 new encounters across four expansive wings as members of the Horde and Alliance take the war directly to Garrosh’s doorstep. Learn more about the new encounters in Patch 5.4 Raid Preview: Siege of Orgrimmar.  Siege of Orgrimmar supports the following difficulty modes: Normal, Heroic, Raid Finder, and (new) Flexible Raid. Information on the availability of each difficulty can be found in the Siege of Orgrimmar Raid Schedule.   ***New Feature: Flexible Raid Difficulty***  This is a new raid difficulty designed for pre-made groups of 10 to 25 players or any number in between. This means it's possible to have raids of 15 or 22 players! Difficulty will adjust automatically based on the number of players present with encounters intended to provide a challenge roughly between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.  Flexible Raid difficulty requires a pre-made group to join but has no minimum item level requirements or role restrictions. Both BattleTag™ and Real ID friends are eligible to participate.  Loot quality will be between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty and awarded through a personal loot system (similar to Raid Finder). Bonus rolls and loot specialization will also be supported.  Player spells with different target limits depending on raid size will gradually increase their limits based on the number of players in Flexible Raid difficulty. Players will be able to earn raid achievements just like in Normal or Heroic difficulty. Flexible Raid difficulty has a lockout that is separate from Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.  To learn more about Flexible Raids, please visit our blog titled: A Raid for All Seasons: Flexible Raid Preview.    ***New Area: Timeless Isle***  A mysterious island, lost for millennia to the currents of time, has emerged from the mists off the eastern coast of Jade Forest.  Players seeking to explore the Timeless Isle should visit their faction's shrine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.  The Timeless Isle is inhabited by all manner of strange and powerful creatures that will test the mettle of solo explorers, but great rewards await the brave and skillful: epic loot, bind-to-account gear, Mogu Runes of Fate, pets, mounts, fun toys, and much more.  The Isle is filled with secrets and mysteries, many of which dynamically become available to explorers. Keep an eye on your minimap while on the Isle for information on nearby events!  The Timeless Isle is home to five new world raid bosses! Players may face each of the four Celestials in a trial of combat.  Heroes who have earned the legendary cloak from Wrathion may access the sanctum of the fiery Yaungol demigod Ordos, atop the Timeless Isle.  ***New Feature: Proving Grounds***  Proving Grounds is a new feature where level 90 players can test their mettle and undertake trials designed for Damage, Tank, or Healer roles to test and improve their combat skills in a safe, controlled environment.  To access the Proving Grounds, speak with an NPC in the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit or a class trainer.  Each trial is available in four separate difficulties: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Endless. Harder difficulties include more difficult and varied enemies.  Endless mode allows you to test your mettle against increasingly difficult enemies. Compare your best scores to friends and guildmates!  Learn more about this feature in our blog titled Proving Grounds Preview.  ***New Feature: Connected Realms***  Connected Realm is a set of two or more standard realms that have been permanently and seamlessly “linked.” Players on the same Connected Realm will be able to trade, send and receive mail, join the same guilds, access a single Auction House, run the same Raids and Dungeons, and join other adventurers to complete quests.  To make Connected Realm feel seamless, player’s home realms won't be indicated in the game world. In certain places, such as chat, the players' home realms will be displayed next to their name. Learn more about this feature in our Patch 5.4 Feature Preview: Connected Realms.  ***Redesigned Arena System***  Players no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete.  Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the appropriate size (cross-realm groups are supported) may queue for an Arena bracket of the same size (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).  Each player will have a personal rating that increase or decrease based on victories and defeats against other rated opponents. Opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of the party.  Conquest cap, requirements on gear and enchantments will be based on the player's personal rating.  The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup. Just like Rated Battlegrounds and normal Battlegrounds, all Arenas will now be region-wide! At the end of an Arena season, the top players in a region will still earn titles and mounts.  For more details about the change to Arenas, please see the blog titled: Patch 5.4 Arena Update.  ***The Legendary Quest Continues***  Wrathion’s final quests are now available for dedicated heroes who have fought on his behalf throughout the pandaren campaign. He’s waiting at the Tavern in the Mists in the Veiled Stair.  Complete Wrathion’s final tasks on the Timeless Isle and upgrade your celestial cloak to Legendary quality!  Only players equipped with a Legendary cloak can reach the Sanctum of Ordos atop the Timeless Isle. (This privilege extends account-wide.)  ***Battlefield: Barrens***  Vol’jin and his forces move beyond gathering supplies and into a full assault on the Horde capital. As such, the Battlefield: Barrens weekly quest will no longer be available once the invasion on Orgrimmar begins in 5.4.  Ravika, the Darkspear Rebellion Quartermaster, will no longer be available. Latent Kor'kron armor tokens will no longer drop or be available for purchase. Players who still have a Radical Mojo will continue to be able to combine it with existing Latent Kor'kron armor tokens.  Gahz'rooki's Summoning Stone and Raptorhide Boxing Gloves are now available as a rare drop from Kor’kron, and other associated creatures in Northern Barrens.",™
t5_2qqdp,anon120,1378744009,"I've been in that situation in the past where I would be the one inflicting pain upon myself (pulling my own hair out, screaming until I lose my voice, etc etc). Thankfully my SO never touched me but his anxiety was the root of me losing control and we both knew it. It wasn't healthy and ultimately, we realized that, although we loved each other, we weren't right for each other and were causing more harm than good.  Love sometimes isn't enough and you have to come to terms with that. Leaving your SO will be the toughest decision you'll ever make. He might cry, get angry at you and might even put all the blame on you, but that is not the case. Be strong for yourself and be strong for him and cut ties sooner rather than later.

Then you spend a year in this training program, and you start to hear how the world really works, how these heroes (who were never around to save you), are really ruining the world. You get conditioned and practically brainwashed. They hand you a uniform when your year is up, they tell you that you can take it or walk away. A few of your friends walk, but you never hear from them again. You take the uniform and fight for the resistance. To take the world back. ",™

t5_2qi6d,seattle_dilettante,1378751541,"Video description:  Published on Aug 10, 2012 First! ABS is a life-saver. In NO way is the point of this video to be ""anti ABS"". Just the opposite. This video shows a controlled situation. ABS can take over anytime the situation is beyond control and prevent a locked-wheel skid, which is always dangerous on a motorcycle. The point here is only this: ABS is NOT a substitute for braking skill.  Over the past few years, Anti-Lock Brake Systems (ABS) have become much more common on motorcycles. ABS is a tremendous safety feature, and its increasing availability is saving motorcyclists lives every day. However, there are many riders -- both those using ABS, and those who do not have it -- who do not understand exactly what its function is, and how to maximize its value.   Both motors in this video are 2012, Harley-Davidson® Road King® Police (FLHRP) models. **Both motors are equipped with ABS.** Both are traveling at 40 MPH, and both begin braking at the same point. **Harris, riding the near motor, uses ""threshold combination braking""** (the maximum amount of braking, using both the front and rear brakes, before either a locked wheel or ABS activation), **the rider on the far motor; one of the top police motor instructors in the world, deliberately engages the ABS**, rather than using proper braking technique. As you can see, the properly braked motorcycle stops in excess of 20 feet more quickly than the motorcycle that is stopped using the ABS as a braking tool.   ABS is not a tool to stop the motorcycle (or any vehicle). ABS has only one function: to prevent locked wheel skids while braking. It does this by releasing and reapplying the brakes several times a second. As should be clear, this has the effect of lengthening braking distance, since the brakes are being released momentarily.  So, it is very important for riders to understand that proper brake application will stop a motorcycle faster, since it uses all the efficiency of the brakes. It is also important to understand that the fact that a motorcycle is equipped with ABS does not -- by itself -- increase the stopping distance. Unless either poor braking, or a surface change causes ABS activation, an ABS equipped motorcycle will function exactly like one without ABS. The value of ABS is that it allows a vehicle to stop safely, when either of these issues occurs. On a motor without ABS, those things would cause a locked wheel skid, which not only increases stopping distance, but results in instability often leading to a crash.   ABS is a tremendous safety feature, and if it's available, on any vehicle you are considering you should insist that your vehicle be equipped with it. However, a motorcyclist should no more use ABS regularly than the driver of a car should frequently use the air bags.",®

t5_2qh22,tundranocaps,1378755829,"Up until now the ""hurting"" wasn't really hurting, it was more RomCom nonsense ""But why doesn't he choose me?!"" - ok, that shit hurts when you're in high school, but in this show it was very slight and weird from the girls who wanted Keima. But now we have girls who actually show us Real Angst™, and from Keima. And he still has to make a conquest, and we have strange dealings afoot.  **Thoughts and Notes**:  ""Run all you want, I'll still catch you"" - Ayumi is like a rare Poke'Mon or butterfly that Keima needs to catch and pin on his wall. Also, this show still wins for (un)intentional sexual harassment/out of context quotes. I wonder how many I'd find if I actively looked for them.  So he's speaking his thoughts out loud again - this is the real difference between Keima and such masters such as Lelouch and Charlemagne, of whom they tell could write with his mouth shut (just a story, used to make a point about old Latin).  ""No matter what route I take, I'll run into Chihiro eventually."" - just kill her! More seriously, this shows what's so different about this season - once people have memories, there are actually *consequences*, we're leaving game-land where you can make multiple saves and undo decisions. Also, the obvious solution is obvious - conclude the conquest before running into her again. Though doing the conquest in public also means the goddess will materialize in this very public situation - of course, the real problem is that of *narrative causality* - the narrative requires Chihiro to always butt in, always appear. And that when the goddess appears it'll also be in public.   I have to admit, Keima's approach of asking Chihiro to join forces with him surprised me - but it shouldn't have. This is goal-oriented Keima, who won't let reality or emotions get in his way, this is him recovering from the previous episode. In other words, this is 100% Keima-Lelouch, and it still blindsided me completely, for I am not him, O Great Capture God.  ""You exist outside the law."" - she had been framed for wrongs she had not done, she had been granted a weapon, and she must save everyone. I'm having violent flashbacks to early 90s shows. The A-Team and Renegade. Ho ho ho.  Well, here they spell it out in case anyone didn't realize it after nearly 3 seasons - Haqua and Elsie are Katsuragi's buddies, not vice versa.

I think it is what happens when you declare that your own side and your own political agendas are the one true good™ because then everyone who are not on your side is instantly turned into a disgusting monster who deserves no empathy or mercy and cannot be reasoned with and that is a problem because pacifists are just as nice and good, or evil and hateful as every other human being in this world. They are in fact not superior humans eventhough that is what they pretend to be.  I know about a homosexual officer who died under mysterious circumstances the week before the pride parade. No official cause of death has been announced eventhough it was more than a year since he died but the timing makes people suspect suicide. The reason people suspect suicide is because he attended the pride parade the year before his death and was bullied by a group of young pacifists because they did not really like the idea of homosexuals serving in the army so they kinda hijacked the pride parade to push their hateful agenda...",™

t5_2sakj,elegant_elisabeta,1378785752,"Hello, I'm in a foreign language department, so I'm not sure how relevant my experience is to psychology, but we generally do our own English ↔ foreign language translations, as by this point we have near-native-like fluency. If there is a well-known translation of a work, it is fine to use that translation as well in our papers. I've read papers in which authors cite other foreign languages without translation, and personally I wish they would.   You say you are not qualified to do the translation work justice; could you make the translations faithful and without grammatical mistakes? In that case, I think you would be fine doing it on your own. It would only be in a literary work, perhaps, that a translation that takes into account poetical style would be desired. Or could you perhaps translate the passages on your own and have a colleague who knows Russian check them for accuracy? Failing that, the other option would simply be to paraphrase what you've read and cite it in English without quoting directly. Regarding online translators, even Google, I would avoid that route. I guess in the end it boils down to 'how good is your Russian?' :)  As far as formatting, in my field at least, we typically give both the original text and the translation, either directly in the text or in a footnote.    Best of luck! I think it's a great idea to incorporate foreign-language texts into your research!",↔

Yes, while we fantasize about the humiliation of others knowing our *little secret*, it's highly uncouth to expose our fetish to non-consenting vanilla folk.  On another note, I'm extremely fascinated that I found a subreddit that shuns colloquial terms.  I'm sure nobody here eats ""sliders"" but instead eat ""hamburgers.""  I bet nobody here drinks ""pop"", ""soda"" or even ""coke"", but instead drink ""Coca-Cola"", ""Pepsi Cola"", ""Royal Crown Cola"" and the like.     ✈   ✈ ✈ ",✈
t5_2tcpq,Kichigai,1378790575,"Well, see, I dunno how I feel about that. Then they just stay in their little echo chamber bubble and never change. They just become more and more convinced they're right, and because of a we-can-do-no-wrong air that tends to be cultivated in those environments more extreme voices and opinions tend to proliferate and spread like a plague.  Worse yet, they're bringing their kids in there, shielding them from opposing view points and critical argumentation that would enable them to develop their own unique opinions, and just start parroting back what they've been steeped in. The end result is that we've perpetuated petulant personal points of view for yet another generation, and perhaps even made things worse, with this new generation having spent their entire lives in the bubble, rather than having the bubble develop around them in their adult lives. They will have lived their entire lives in this rut that who knows what they'll teach those that follow them, or their reaction to anyone who dares to break ranks, either because they thought for themselves, or are a member of a group being railed against.  I'm not trying to say this is even remotely like child abuse or anything, but the way that everyone is just going off into their own corners, and only listening to the voices telling them what they want to hear, and how we're teaching our children that this is A Good Thing™ really seems to me to be A Bad Thing™ for society on the whole.",™
t5_2qi6d,brit_hoon,1378791028,"Maybe I'm just dumb (in fact, I'm pretty sure of it), but the webpage doesn't exactly make it easy to figure out what these are.  - The page title is ""Home page"". - ""How it works"" link is a big PDF (!!) with a ton of tiny text, starting with a ""Practice guide"" and some safety warnings and iPhone set-up screenshots, but I still don't know *what it is*.  OK, let's look somewhere else... - If I go back to the main page and scroll down, I can see that you say they're ""innovative"" (...great?) and ""allow remote access and control of target devices"" (can't I just get those finger-tip attachment thingies and do this with my current gloves?), but I'm still not sure exactly what they do. - The video starts out with a lot of back-patting (""You thrive on adventure!  You're the first to get out there!"") that still doesn't tell me what it does.  By now I think you're trying to sell me Red Bull, not gloves.  I finally figured out what this was by seeing the subtle animation from about 0:40-45 in the video (and then I had to rewind to make sure I was seeing it right), when it shows a gloved hand touching fingers together as it says ""play, pause"", and so forth.  Oh!  So it's a Bluetooth glove with switches in the fingertips?  Why didn't you just say this (and show the finger-tapping image) top and center on the main page?  This is *the one thing* that you do that is new and unique, and you seem to have done your best to bury it under paragraphs of text, and in the middle of your cartoon product intro video.  I also noticed you have ""Every Other Glove is Obsolete™"" in many places.  That may or not be true, but this also doesn't tell me anything unique about your gloves.  Don't the marketing folks like to say ""Don't say anything about your product for which your competitors wouldn't say the opposite""?  And nobody would say ""Our gloves are obsolete"".  EDIT: I see you posted a comment linking to a couple of old Youtube videos showing how it works.  Either of these videos on its own would have been 100 times more useful to me than what's on the webpage now.  Literally 10 seconds into the first video, I could see exactly what it does and how it's used.  It reminds me of an iPhone/iPad commercial: just a hand, showing how to use the thing.  You don't need 100 words of copy to say that you're ""innovative"" when you can just show how innovative it is! ",™

The Red Pill didn't exist back then(that I know of) but I almost certainly would have swallowed that right up(and gotten more miserable due to my being such a hopeless beta). I've already written my autobiography in a /r/letsnotmeet thread asking for creepers to tell their side of the story.  * Awfully. I was desperately lonely and suffering from undiagnosed depression, and blamed it all on women not appreciating how Nice™ I was(I actually wasn't, but I didn't realize that). I was also pretty creepy.  * Oddly enough, it was the MRA subreddit that started it. At first it was glorious coming into that place and finding all my thoughts and frustrations validated. I was really getting screwed over by those perfidious feeeemales. But soon enough the rampant *hate* became apparent to me and I started thinking ""Holy *shit*, is this really what I think?"" I left and never came back but after that I started wondering whether my perception of women and feminism might be skewed and I slowly started to investigate further. A few years later I'm sitting down to pee.  * I haven't had anyone proclaim subscription to MRA or Redpill thought, but I have argued with a couple of friends on behalf of feminism(they wanted to call themselves egalitarianists and believed that there was no longer any oppression of women in western society) and I have another friend who has some weird ideas on how to woo women. When I told him I had gone on a date with a girl and she later rejected the idea of a romantic relationship, he posited that I ""had given her too much time to rationalize"". He keeps trying to mentor me in my dealings with women, but here's the kicker: I've actually spoken to a couple of crushes of his and learned that he is just as creepy and pathetic as I used to be.",™

We simply substituted [cookie butter](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Speculoos-Cookie-Butter/dp/B006KK4GUO) for peanut butter.   **Ingredients:**  * Brownie Base  1 box Betty Crocker® fudge brownie mix  Water, vegetable oil and eggs called for on brownie mix box  * Filling  1/2 cup butter, softened  1/2 cup cookie butter  2 cups powdered sugar  2 teaspoons milk  * Topping  1 cup semisweet chocolate chips  1/4 cup butter   **Directions:**  Heat oven to 350°F. Grease bottom only of 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray or shortening. (For easier cutting, line pan with foil, then grease foil on bottom only of pan.) Make brownies as directed on box. Cool completely. In medium bowl, beat filling ingredients with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Spread mixture evenly over brownie base. In small microwavable bowl, microwave topping ingredients uncovered on High 30 to 60 seconds; stir until smooth. Cool 10 minutes; spread over filling. Refrigerate about 30 minutes or until set. For brownies, cut into 9 rows by 4 rows. Store covered in refrigerator.",®

t5_2qldo,WHATS_AN_ASS,1378833145,"I am a 19 year old ( I like to think rather successful ) entrepreneur of 4 years and huge EDM fan going on 8+ years, so take what I said/say however you please. Anyway, I don't like how EDM and ravers have progressed over the past 2 years. That is because it went mainstream and hit the radio. Ticket prices have nearly doubled, attendance to shows/fests have gone up exponentially, and there are tons of new artists that have large enough fan bases to tour getting out there every month. I don't necessarily like this because what appeals to the newer demographic consisting of what I call ""bros"" and ""molly chanting fools that are there for the drugs which have gone mainstream and not the music"" is very similar sounding music which artists have to appeal to if they want to get a larger fan base. But for you, this is great because they are hopping in by the millions and bite on whatever they see other people doing ie. kandi, neon, lights, drugs. In a festival atmosphere where everyone is promoting PLUR, your product could potentially do very well with some minor tweaking toward this culture. If you tell me what state/city you are in I can maybe point you in a few directions of where to go if you want to take a swing at this market. I know you said the business side isn't easy and that you want to hop into the invention process again, but I feel if you don't over complicate the business side and hop directly into different markets you will learn the business side as you go. I personally have been passionate about the business side of all businesses for nearly my entire life, so it comes rather easy to me, but yeah, just hop in and figure it out as you go. Don't let your own mind cause more anxiety/stress than there really is. Contact the next festival that you can physically get to, apply to be a vendor ( they may take a percentage, charge a flat fee, or both ), if you get approved as a vendor figure out how to put Peace/Love/Unity/Respect on each blade and maybe the name of the event and the year if they give you permission ( promotes the whole friendship ideal which is big here because I and many others love fests because you meet tons of new people and like to contribute to everyone's good time and love getting something special from someone to remember them by ) buy a banner, maybe find some cute girls to work the table with you, and ✔ JUST DO IT. ✔  ( I have been really sick for the past 4 days and am on some medication that is making me rather loopy, so excuse me if I repeated myself or if this isn't even that helpful, I can give you a lot clearer info if you are interested when I feel better )",✔

t5_2qh1s,Psychomat,1378838861,"I have to admit I'm kind of surprised at the (what I see as) fairly consistent push-back against a minimum wage hike here on Reddit. Not that we're always champions of the little guys or somesuchshit but that we're so consistently against the big guys. No one (IMO) can or should be arguing that the shifting distribution of wealth in this country is a Good Thing™. If that is the case, we must work to stop and reverse this trend.   So let's divert some money from employers down to those who will, in all honesty, likely spend 99% of the increase on their living needs. I understand prices will go up. I understand jobs will be reduced. Both are inevitable and I also think the authors assertion that part of the increase will be born by decreases in profits and executive compensation is incorrect too. Companies will fight tooth and nail to pass every red cent on to customers. But the increases (if not done in a weak-ass fashion) should outweigh the effects. So a Big Mac goes from $4.00 to $5.00.. That's OK because the ""low wage"" people who frequent the establishments are making double (or almost) what they used to. Again, I think they'll simply pour 99% of the increases right back into the economy.  Anyway, I'm sure I'm just a economics moron. :) Have at me.",™

Not that useful or preferable to me in general, so I can't speak really, but if I had to say something I'd say add inline comments to the example files for each symbol with the name. Most people I know who use these setups just clone it over and don't customize much, so any improvement to searchability is good.  My biggest want for this kind of system these days is to have more a general Unicode IME with toggles for different char sets, like if you turn on emoticons and type 'XD' then '😆' will appear in a dropdown menu, just like for a Japanese IME if you type 'jin' then '人' will appear as a dropdown option.

If there is nothing there walk into his main base and kill him.  warp in every time your warpgates are not on cooldown  after warpin in build one more pylon (8 supply warpin, 1 pylon gives 8 supply). You don't need to build the pylon if you've lost 4 or more units.   Extra notes:  Hotkey your nexus. (ctrl + 1-0, select the hotkeyed units/buildings pressing the number you hotkeyed them on.  Hotkey your gateway (press the hotkey, press the hotkey to transform them, press the stalker hotkey and hold shift to warpin 4 stalkers  go to options -&gt; gameplay -&gt; under ""user interface"" select display hotkeys on command card  to build, move, attack with anything always use hotkeys, It might take some time to get used to them but they are faster once you get used to them, A LOT faster  replay coming soon™  edit: replay: http://drop.sc/359022  some probes were a little bit late  my chrono boost on 13 was a few seconds late (it should start as soon as you start the 13th probe)  I didn't rally my 11th probe to the pylon to make a gateway  and my stalker went to a watch tower for no reason, it should be with the zealot/probe the whole time  I let my scouting probe sit afk in his base it could've died, after scouting move it to where you want a pylon.  when i went to attack him I moved with my probe in front (it should be in the back)  and I should wait for my warped in stalkers before going up the ramp.   I started my first warpin at 5:40  on my first try i got 5:48, by doing the exact same thing but everything a little bit faster  i was able to attack 8 second faster. (aroudn 6 minutes is more than good for you)  this is the difference making probes 1-2 second late makes in just a very short game.  in normal games where you'll play longer everything will be later if you're not making probes for short times each time.  and each supply blocks delays everything even more.  so like people have said: PROBES and PYLONS!:)  this will probably get you out of bronze I recommend not doing it constantly, do other stuff, as long as you make probes and pylons everything will work  probes and pylons will get you much much further than the 4gate.",™

Made from the finest plastics, from oil artificially aged and pressured from the remains of the greatest heroes of our age.  You know of Sir BustAMix?""  ""Ahh, yeah I think, wasn't he the one with the leather whips and that cuckoo clock wrapped around his neck?""  ""Why sir, yes indeed he was.  Those where the days when he brought fiends of evil to heel, with a whip in his hand and rhyme in his mouth.  Anyway he himself contributed upon his untimely death to our patented Heroes' Mix© oil that was then turned into the sleek plastic you see before you.""  ""Well I don't know, that guy around the corner was offering one that lit up and played a relevant jingle whenever you struck with it.  And his was 200 bitcoins cheaper too.""  ""Sir, sir, sir, I can tell that your drive a hard bargain.  I will let you in on a little secret about that sword before you, one that I had hoped not to share since it highlights an incident that the company doesn't want spread.  After all who wants a weapon from a corporation whose factories are involved in accidents?  But sir, I will tell you if you promise not to let it out.""  Highly impressed the buyer quickly replied, ""Of course I can keep a secret.""  The salesman wiped a handkerchief across his sweat covered forehead and leaned in close.  ""This batch of model 'Killee-Deads 2056's was involved in an accident at the factory.  Somehow a dragon had gotten loose and then got its arm stuck in machinery.  Well, as it lay bleeding into the machine, this batch of swords came through and got doused in the stuff, making them completely scratch and hip-hop resistant.  Now even though I know this and you know this, I am not allowed to charge extra so its doubly a steal.""  While the customer ingested this knowledge, the salesman pulled a comb from his pocket and slicked it through his hair.  A smile rose on his face, though he quickly manged to hide it, the moment he saw that gleam in the customers eye that meant he had made a decision and was already envisioning using the product on some punk.  ""It’s a deal.""  Shaking the customers hand, the salesman added on, ""Well come on back to my office and we can fill out the paperwork.""  Giving his best impression of someone who has been beat, the salesman led him on.",©

Diva cup website says this:  &gt;The DivaCup is worn low at the base of the vagina and away from the cervix. This means that it should not interfere with an internal birth control device. However, please use caution when using any internal feminine hygiene product with an IUD as there is the possibility that they can be dislodged. When using The DivaCup, it is important to carefully follow the directions in our User Guide, paying close attention to inserting The DivaCup low in the vaginal canal and breaking the seal (suction) before removal. Many of our customers use The DivaCup with an IUD or NuvaRing® simultaneously, but we recommend that you become familiar with your birth control device’s risks (such as the body expelling the IUD, etc.).

t5_2rz8w,idgelee,1378846872,"From this [article](http://www.askmen.com/top_10/fitness_top_ten/29_fitness_list.html):  &gt;Make sure it’s a protein bar  &gt;To be called a “protein” bar, it should have at least 15 grams of protein per bar. Although carb content is variable, you should choose a bar that is relatively low in carbs to avoid blood and insulin spikes that will hinder your fat-loss efforts. Energy bars are at the other end of the spectrum: high-carb, low-protein. Energy bars such as PowerBars® or Clif® Bars are useful for intense aerobic exercise that lasts more than an hour. Meal replacement bars like Balance® Bar, or Nutribar® have a more balanced ratio of carbs, proteins and fats, and usually contain more calories than other types of bars. Despite what they sound like, these can never replace a properly balanced meal. Organic and raw bars like Lärabar® provide energy in as natural a method as possible. They are made with whole foods and are devoid of artificial sweeteners and inserted protein. They are, nevertheless, relatively high in sugars and low in protein.  &gt;Look at the source of protein  &gt;Most protein bars will have a “propriety protein blend” as one of the first things listed in the ingredients list. Choose bars that use high-quality sources of protein, such as hydrolyzed whey, whey isolates and micellar casein. Whey or soy concentrates are fine but are frequently used as fillers and shouldn’t be listed too high on the ingredients list. Gelatin (or collagen) is often added to protein bars to improve texture. Since it is a type of protein, it contributes to the total number of grams in the bar. Careful, though: It’s a low-quality protein, and some unscrupulous brands use it to artificially boost their protein content. Check the ingredients and ensure that gelatin and collagen are not listed too high up on the list.  Protein bars that are using gelatin are made out of animal proteins (do you know what gelatin is made from?)   &gt;Look at the carbs  &gt;Just because a bar is high in protein doesn’t mean it’s low in carbs. First off, avoid protein bars that list refined sugars, such as sucrose, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup and chocolate, as the first or second ingredient. These are no better than candy bars. To make a protein taste good without using too much refined sugars, manufacturers often add artificial sweeteners (acesulfame potassium) and sugar alcohols (or polyols) such as xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol, glycerol or glycerine. Sugar alcohols should be listed along with sugars and dietary fiber under the total carbohydrate listing on the nutrition label. These are hydrogenated forms of carbohydrate that are colorless and odorless, and give the bar a pleasing moist texture. They are not as sweet as sucrose, have fewer calories and don’t cause tooth decay. However, they may cause bloating and intestinal discomfort in some people since they are not completely absorbed by the gut. They do contribute calories and affect blood-sugar levels, so they need to be accounted for by the low-carb dieter. Nutrition bars are not subjected to any quality testing prior to marketing. In 2001, the supplement-testing group ConsumerLab.com analyzed 30 brands of energy bars and found that 60% failed to meet their labeling claims. Among the highest failure rates were protein bars (92% failed), often because they were under-reporting the amount of carbs and sodium contained in the bar. So even if you’re super-skilled in reading nutrition labels and ingredient lists, you may not actually be consuming what you think you’re consuming.  this means she could potentially be consuming carbs still -- quite a few of them even -- and never quite getting to keto to lose the weight and ""cheating"" won't really be cheating.   The goal of weightloss should be sustainable changes, not temporary calorie drop with excessive cardio/weight lifting followed by a celebration meal. Every medical professional will tell you restricting *too* much will cause people to not want to stick with it. Each person is different but maintaining a negative relationship with food can ultimately be detrimental to anyone's health overall.   &gt;Look at the fat  &gt;Ever since manufacturers were pressured to remove trans fats from their products, they’ve replaced them with palm oil and palm kernel oil. Although not all saturated fats are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, palm oil is. Be careful not to consume too much of it. Modified triacylglycerol (SALATRIM, brand name: Benefat®) is appearing as a lower-calorie fat replacer in many products. SALATRIM is approved by the American Dietetic Association and the FDA. It has no known side effects and it does not affect blood-cholesterol levels or absorption of fat-soluble vitamins or other nutrients.  this means if all of her meals are coming from protein bars that contain palm oil she could be doing some serious damage to her heart/liver/pancreas/galbladder etc.   Like you mentioned ""eating clean"" is the best way to go. Lots of fruits and veggies, close the farm etc. And building ""cheats"" into a diet actually makes them not cheats, but part of a balanced and healthy view of eating.   edit: formatting   ",®

t5_2s64c,Deserak,1378847687,"I thought it was I-beam shaped beams of flame he used to cut giant centipede things? Could be mistaken though.  In theory it would be highly impractical, but with the right kind of focus object... you've got me thinking now. Let's say a device that stores up energy in itself, like Harry's force rings or the electrical whip that Elaine used (that charged by plugging into any given electrical outlet). Then, being a magical foci specifically designed for such a task, the Dresaber™ would direct and shape the power through it on it's own - same way his blasting rod focus's his fire magic so that can use up less energy shaping the magic and more energy giving it oomph.  So, Harry pulls out the Dresaber™, pours some willpower in as a trigger of sorts, and he's good to go. No extra effort to shape the magic because the focus is doing that for him, and the extra energy needed to maintain it's cutting ability/heat would come from what's stored up inside. You're average life or death battle only lasts five to ten minutes, less so when you can pull out a freaking lightsaber on your enemy when they aren't expecting it, so it wouldn't have to be maintainable for long. Also consider his Winter Knight powerup, and the fact Harry has been practicing with more delicate/focused magic of late from training Molly, so the idea of him building a more complicated focus than he's done before purely to challenge himself makes sense...

t5_2r1ip,CricketPinata,1378869215,"Learning how to use your equipment is a lot more useful than obsessing about the bigger-better-deal, since there is ALWAYS a bigger/better camera.   Oh you got a Handycam and you enjoy it? What're you just out of highschool? Get a damned DSLR they are cheap! Oh you got a 5Dmk.III now? What an amateur get a Red! Oh you got a Red? But it's just an MX?! You're nothing if it's not an Epic! Oh you got an Epic? What bullshit, you need a Dragon if you want to shoot the Hobbit! You got a Dragon? Wally Pfister says digital is shit, film is the only thing that matter! Oh you got film? But it's only 16mm you have to go 35mm if you want to be a ""REAL PRO!™"", OH you saved up for 35mm? Bullshit, if it's not IMAX you're a pretender, anybody can order some ends and shoot some 35mm over a weekend, only ""TRUE PROFESSIONALS!!™"" can shoot IMAX, oh but Roger Deakins said Arri Alexa beats film!, DID YOU SEEEEEE SKYFALL!?!?!, you've got to be riding the future-wave! Go Alexa!! Oh you got an Alexa? The F65 is TECHNICALLY better, etc. etc. etc. etc. Blah blah blah.   There will always be someone to judge whatever you choose, there will always be a gear head with their own pet preferences. I know, i've got my own preferences.   But the difference between me and some other gear heads I know is that I don't let my preferences get in the way of shooting with what i've got. I prefer my GH2, but if my camera op brings a 60D with Magic Lantern to the table, i'm not scoffing at him or his choice, i'm working with him because I want him, not my preference.   Learn your system in and out, watching tutorials from cinematographers, shoot as much as you can, practice as much as you can, watch the special features of DVD's, study how things are accomplished, study composition and classical art, see how things are balanced in the frame and how people are framed, take some acting classes, READ EVERYTHING YOU CAN, listen to the radio and podcasts that do stories about people, or radioshows, listen to how words sound, what stories make you feel good, inspire you.   Becoming obsessed with stories, and what makes a good story, and what is interesting, and compelling to you, both in a philosophical sense, but also in aesthetic and word-sense is so much dramatically more important than equipment.   In 10 years we'll all have 4K+ video on our cellphones.   In 20 years cameras on whatever replaces the cellphone will have surpassed unaugmented human vision in both latitude, resolution, and color rendition.   But people will still be doing Shakespeare and Greek Tragedies for thousands of years after you die.   One if these things have weight in universality and communicating to others, the other is a technology which is rapidly evolving and will eventually be forgotten by all but camera historians and gear nerds.

t5_2qh16,coretechnologie,1378889209,"Most wireless networks are based on the IEEE® 802.11 standards. A basic wireless network consists of multiple stations communicating with radios that broadcast in either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band, though this varies according to the locale and is also changing to enable communication in the 2.3GHz and 4.9GHz ranges.  802.11 networks are organized in two ways. In infrastructure mode, one station acts as a master with all the other stations associating to it, the network is known as a BSS, and the master station is termed an access point (AP). In a BSS, all communication passes through the AP; even when one station wants to communicate with another wireless station, messages must go through the AP. In the second form of network, there is no master and stations communicate directly. This form of network is termed an IBSS and is commonly known as an ad-hoc network.  802.11 networks were first deployed in the 2.4GHz band using protocols defined by the IEEE® 802.11 and 802.11b standard. These specifications include the operating frequencies and the MAC layer characteristics, including framing and transmission rates, as communication can occur at various rates. Later, the 802.11a standard defined operation in the 5GHz band, including different signaling mechanisms and higher transmission rates. Still later, the 802.11g standard defined the use of 802.11a signaling and transmission mechanisms in the 2.4GHz band in such a way as to be backwards compatible with 802.11b networks.  Separate from the underlying transmission techniques, 802.11 networks have a variety of security mechanisms. The original 802.11 specifications defined a simple security protocol called WEP. This protocol uses a fixed pre-shared key and the RC4 cryptographic cipher to encode data transmitted on a network. Stations must all agree on the fixed key in order to communicate. This scheme was shown to be easily broken and is now rarely used except to discourage transient users from joining networks. Current security practice is given by the IEEE® 802.11i specification that defines new cryptographic ciphers and an additional protocol to authenticate stations to an access point and exchange keys for data communication. Cryptographic keys are periodically refreshed and there are mechanisms for detecting and countering intrusion attempts. Another security protocol specification commonly used in wireless networks is termed WPA, which was a precursor to 802.11i. WPA specifies a subset of the requirements found in 802.11i and is designed for implementation on legacy hardware. Specifically, WPA requires only the TKIP cipher that is derived from the original WEP cipher. 802.11i permits use of TKIP but also requires support for a stronger cipher, AES-CCM, for encrypting data. The AES cipher was not required in WPA because it was deemed too computationally costly to be implemented on legacy hardware.  The other standard to be aware of is 802.11e. It defines protocols for deploying multimedia applications, such as streaming video and voice over IP (VoIP), in an 802.11 network. Like 802.11i, 802.11e also has a precursor specification termed WME (later renamed WMM) that has been defined by an industry group as a subset of 802.11e that can be deployed now to enable multimedia applications while waiting for the final ratification of 802.11e. The most important thing to know about 802.11e and WME/WMM is that it enables prioritized traffic over a wireless network through Quality of Service (QoS) protocols and enhanced media access protocols. Proper implementation of these protocols enables high speed bursting of data and prioritized traffic flow.",®
t5_2qh1i,RabbitHats,1378890038,"Probably told this one before, but why not?  Let's disco.   ------------  College.  Hanging out with some of my classmates after a long day, enjoying some drinks.  Enjoying some drinks turns into party time.  I abstain from getting shit-faced and decide after a couple glasses of water that it was time to hit the dusty trail.  I depart.  About halfway home, a 20-odd minute drive, I realize I forgot my wallet at this guy's apartment.    I turn around and angrily speed back to the residence, gently knocking and letting myself in, figuring the party was still going strong, but I found it strangely quiet.  Grabbing my wallet, I hear some odd sounds going on behind the bead-curtain leading into the bedroom.  Curiosity won me over - I had to see.    The smell was what hit me first - a tangy, kind of musty scent.  Familiar, but neither objectionable nor pleasant.  It was pussy.  Intrigued, yet frightened, I slowly peeled back the beads to reveal a strange entanglement of bodies that went something like this:  * Fat girl naked on bed, legs spread.  Hairy vagina being penetrated lustily by a skinny, big-nosed guy. * Big-Nose™, administering a standing fuck to the she-giant, is having his asshole eaten by a very flamboyant gay friend; his awkward erection flopping as he greedily peppers Big-Nose's anus with his lizard-like tongue. * Hot chick is sucking one of Fat Girl's tits. * Fat Cowboy is in corner wicker chair masturbating and laughing, his mustache twitching amidst beads of sweat running down his pale brow.  My entrance was record-skipping-esque in that all activity halted.  I uttered feebily, ""forgot my wallet,"" and showed myself out.  I found out the next day that their strange sexual machine plowed on with renewed vigor after my visit, with all of them saying I should have joined in.    -----------  **BONUS STORY:**  It's 4am, so fuck it, here's another story that sort of is related.  Halloween Party years back.  Big crowd breaks off as the evening goes on, and by the witching hour only a handful were left:  myself, a gay friend who we'll call Steve, a girl we'll call Pam, and a guy who had recently moved to our area.  Let's call him Bill.  Bill is a rugged man's man:  loves to work on his motorcycle, lots of tattoos, soft-spoken, hard-drinking son of a bitch.   Being the wimpy drinker I am, I walk home, leaving the trio to their duty.  Pam falls asleep on the couch.  Hours pass.  As I'm about to fall asleep I get a phone call from a breathless Pam who had some late-breaking news.  I tell her to go on.  Apparently she had woken up on the couch and next to her were Bill and Steve watching TV.  As she's about to move she hears Bill say to Steve, ""...you can suck my dick if you want to.""  Pretending to be asleep, she gets a front row seat to Steve heartily gorging on Bill's knob.  Steve leaves Bill hanging as he's about to cum, and tells Bill he's got to ""finish inside me.""  Bill nods assent.  Steve briefly exits to the bathroom and comes back with a bottle of shampoo.  Taking off his clown pants (yes, he was a fucking clown), he spreads the shampoo all around his asshole and preps Bill's tool for entry.  Bill fucks Steve's ass for about 15 minutes before blowing his wad.  Bill then threatens Steve into secrecy, but has now become aware of Pam.  Steve ""wakes"" Pam and they cross-examine her before they all part ways.  Bill leaves town 2 days later and is never heard from again.  ",™

As the seller, you are only responsible for ensuring delivery to the US shipping center. The global technology and shipping provider is responsible for processing the package for international shipment. So, proof of delivery (such as USPS Delivery Confirmation®) to the US shipping center will protect you from charge backs, reversals, unauthorized purchases, or Item Not Received claims—assuming all other basic eligibility requirement are met. For items $250 or more, you will need to provide signature confirmation of delivery to the US shipping center to be eligible. Please visit PayPal Seller Protection for full details of the program   What if the item is damaged during shipment?   You are responsible for losses or damage while the item is en route to the US shipping center, and it's recommended that you purchase insurance for the domestic shipping leg. You will not be responsible for losses or damage once an item is shipped from the US shipping center to your buyer.    Do transactions using the Global Shipping Program count toward my seller performance rating on eBay.com?   No, as always, only transactions with US buyers count toward your performance rating on eBay.com. Global Shipping Program transactions count toward your global performance rating.   Your buyers will be able to provide Detailed Seller Ratings for transactions involving Global Shipping Program items. However, if you provide free domestic shipping (i.e., free shipping to the US shipping center), you will automatically receive a 5-star detailed seller rating for shipping and handling charges. In addition, if you provide 1-day handling, upload tracking information within 1 business day of receiving cleared payment, and the tracking information shows the Global Shipping Program item as being delivered to the US shipping center within 4 business days of your receipt of cleared payment, you will automatically receive a 5-star detailed seller rating for shipping time.  If you do not automatically receive a 5-star detailed seller rating for shipping and handling charges or shipping time, any detailed seller ratings for shipping and handling charges or shipping time that are below 5-stars for a Global Shipping Program item will not count against your seller performance standards.

t5_2qio8,suddenly_mozzarella,1378919725,"We combined our two raid teams (one team was 6/13H T15, the other was 1/13H), along with a few other guildies who don't raid often, and cleared it in a bit less than two hours. We had 22 people in the group. Our first team then went and one-shot Immerseus on normal before quitting for the night (not sure how the second team did in their normal run).  **Immerseus:** The hardest part is the initial positioning, making sure that people are spread out enough to kill/heal as many globs as possible during phase 2. Blow all DPS cooldowns right at the pull, since there won't be much of an opportunity later. Healing will get harder as the fight goes on, so make sure your team is prepared for it. Other than that, it was pretty trivial.  **Fallen Protectors**: Keep cleave to a minimum, and make sure the Rook tank is keeping things well away from the raid. Kill order should be Rook &gt; Sun &gt; He. Take Rook to 66%, deal with his DM (three adds, kill order: Sorrow &gt; Gloom &gt; Misery). Take Sun to 66%, everyone stack in the bubble and kill the adds (ranged on big adds outside, melee on little adds inside). Take He to 66%, kill his add (it will fixate a player; if the damage gets to be too much, they can pass the fixate to another player with the extra action button). Rinse, repeat for the 33% threshold, then all three need to die within ~10 seconds of each other. Easy one-shot.  **Norushen**: It's all about add control and sending the right people into the shadow realm in the right order. We sent a tank, a healer, and 2 DPS down for the first round, then rotated in the other tank and healers. Tanks should be soaking the purple orbs left by the big adds when they die in the upper realm. DPS need to be careful not to kill their shadow realm adds too quickly, or they'll overwhelm the raid. It'll take you a look or two to get the feel for the pattern, but it's not too terribly challenging.  **Sha of Pride**: Like Immerseus, positioning is important. Tanks face the boss away from the raid, everyone else loosely stacks on the back side. Make sure that people are close enough to the Simon Says™ platforms to reach them quickly. We assigned people to specific prisons just to minimize confusion. With 22 people, he only used three of the four prisons (the two at the front and the one at the back right as you're facing the boss from the door). I assume that the number of active prisons scales with raid size, but I don't know the order for ""activating"" the prisons.

t5_2w8vd,lurking_quietly,1378944543,"Thanks for the feedback!  So you had a lot to consider here. It ran the gamut from nature/nurture, to the distinction between Good™ and Bad™ forms of selfishness. I think I agree with you that for the most part, our motivations arise from our subjective response to those actions. That is, we like doing certain things because we like how doing them makes *us* feel. Other people might also benefit from what flows from our personal feelings, and we may take into account their feelings in terms of what informs *our* feelings. (For example, something like, ""it makes me feel good to make my friend happy"".) But ultimately, we're motivated by our own emotional reactions.  I think my example may have been bad at explaining what I was getting at. In the case of House, he's an outright *ass*. He happens to be a brilliant ass, and his brilliance saves lots of (fictional) lives. Your point is that being competent or brilliant shouldn't give you free license to be an ass? Yup, totally agree with that.  What I had in mind was more along the lines of someone doing the Right™ Thing for the Wrong™ Reason, something the House example probably muddled. Let me try again... What if there's a politician who votes for some legislation that's the Right™ Thing, but he does it not because he agrees it's the right thing but because he think it'll help them get re-elected? Or, say, a doctor who saves your life not because she personally cares about you as a person, but because she wanted to pursue a lucrative profession? Or because she was pushed into medicine by her parents?  I personally think having the right motivations is definitely useful, if only because I think doing the right things for the wrong reasons is probably difficult to sustain long-term. But if I'm going to a doctor, I ultimately care more about her competence than whether she Cares™ about me.  But I digress... I think you found a useful strategy for deflating bullies. As for the wrestling thing? Yeah, I don't think that guy thought that through. (Something else you could have added: ""plus, it's *super*-masculine to be so obsessed with your weight, don't you think?"")  Again, thanks for indulging my questions!",™

Advertising is everywhere and in the end. You can't escape the grasp of marketing. But I see people posting links to that sub if someone just mentions a brand. I could understand if someone was like ""I absolutely love opening a can of Crazy Cola™. I drink Crazy Cola™ after a nice hot day at the beach. Remember to stop by and buy your Crazy Cola™ at your local Superdooper Market™"". But 90% of the time it's someone posing ""Hey dude I got this headset from XYZ brand and I like it."" Sure it's advertising but it's something you really can't avoid. I just can't imagine these people, do they just not go outside? I feel that posting a link to that sub is more invasive and more annoying than the advertising, and to be honest.... you are advertising by posting a link to that subreddit. ",™

Chapter 1 of Diaspora by Egan is available here:  http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html  I'll also second Stross.  Another delightful novelist in the cyberpunk realm is ""Daemon and Freedom™ comprise a two-part novel by the author Daniel Suarez."" Don't read anything about it. Just buy the two books. It's the best books I've read in a decade, the kind where you read it, go ""huh"", and then start over again.  Also, some older authors you'll enjoy include James Hogan, Hal Clement, and Robert Silverberg, I expect. They're not really cyberpunk, but they do a good job of exploring alien.

I was thinking that it would be very good if when worlds are shared, the author can categorize worlds (not just brains) as ""example"" or ""tutorial"" worlds, maybe also in categories, like environmental, machines, towns, dungeons, etc. For example, if I figured out an awesome way to make a volcano, involving several brains and environmental constructs, I could tag it as Example and Environmental, and perhaps some others so that people can find it if looking for a way to make an awesome volcano in their game and not find it if they are looking for a game to play.  Speaking of that, there should be a way to tag games as pre-release and release, so that when one is looking for an actual finished game, one is not finding just a bunch of partially complete games... of course, ranked as well by the community and some experts.  A method to make a clan (virtual game studio) would be great too, where one could advertise for the above-mentioned specialists (and advertise oneself as such a specialist) and have the ability to coordinate on making an epic game, utilizing a mash-up of MS existing services like Skype and Team Foundation Service, Office 365/SharePoint, Outlook.com, SkyDrive, etc.!

t5_2t0ny,JVocal,1378976301,"Your best bet generally will be to check the announcements page, patch lists, updates etc. In 2 years there hasn't been anything fundamentally game changing but we are expecting new systems coming soon™ (See Torn 2.0 in announcements) - Note that this isn't a reset or anything like that, just the name given to a series of massive updates to areas such as warring/city/attacking etc.    New gym system is fairly straight forward, you basically unlock more and more gyms as you train more, the higher up ones give better gains. You will start with 'global' gym as you're an older player, this will give you the same gains as before but you will have to unlock the others before it before you can surpass global gym. A comprehensive guide on the gym system can be found [here](http://www.torn.com/forums.php?forumID=3&amp;ID=14374048).  With you saying you have been in the education job you should have a fair number of work stats, the specials have been changed there to include the ability to raise all work stats, rather than just intel. Oil rigs tend to pay the best if you're looking to get into a company job that pays well (assuming you're online at least once a day), the primary stat for that being manual labour. Most of the larger rigs will desire around 30k+ manual labour on your work stat, but this will vary, some directors want more some less.  Bookies, again, relatively straight forward... works the same as any actual bookie, all sports are real sports, multipliers and odds are listed besides them, maximum you can bet on any sport is 1b.  Travel system has changed a bit, items now have available stock, restocking times are based off of initial item amounts and how quickly they were bought up. Same applies to the city shops in game, you're limited to 100 items a day from these though.   Chess exists now.   Rest is just little bits and pieces for the most part, listed in announcements and the patch notes there. ",™
t5_2xjja,GantryG,1378976356,"OK, so maybe there should be an ability for when one is sharing something to tag it with intention, so that everyone is clear on what the shared item is.  Intention tags could be something like the below and could be mixed and matched:  -something I whipped up myself that I want to share as an example  -not a game (creation tutorial, example concept, etc.)  -this is a beta, need feedback (hopefully there will be a feedback mechanism)  -please don't remix and share, this is a work in progress  -please remix and take it wherever you want!  -this is a complete game (and future mixes will be treated as offshoots or in the credits there will be a ""complete game"" tag for that credit)  -this game is not only complete but ready to be voted on by the community as a competitive game  -this game is special, consider for top honors in its genre  -etc.   These tags could be in every credit so that one would see the history of intent.  On the receiving side, this would be very helpful knowing that the original author intended because people would be shy about improving on a game and sharing that if they felt that the author before them was going to flame them on the forums for getting credit for their hard work.  It would protect everyone's feelings... those that want to release their work into the public domain to be improved-upon for the good of all, and those that poured 1,000 hours into an epic work and want to get full credit.  Maybe after building upon another's work, additional tags would be selectable when sharing regarding the intention of the added work, as well, which would effect the way that the derivative work is displayed (as a branch or a separate world); tags like:  -this is a minor edit on another's complete work to fix some bugs(show this work as a minor patch to the last work)  -this was a major improvement to a complete work (show as a new version)  -this is a complete work-over of a previous work...  -this is built on a work that was tagged as an example freely to be built-upon  -etc.   These tags would show in the credits and affect the way that the work is displayed on the PS community site, as free-standing or branched off the original...  Advanced tagging like that would help with finding what you want... along with keywords that one can add freestyle that are searchable and genre tags... Maybe, since there are two sides to PS; making games and playing great games, the game-playing side could be walled off not just by community votes, but by these tags.  I would like to see just the best-of-the-best games showing up on a premier gaming section of the site, categorized by genre...   /brain-dump-complete 😊      ",😊

t5_2rdsl,thynnmas,1378986226,"Look, the problem here is in how to do it. T:A is a UE game; the full UE editor they've tweaked for their development is licensed, so they can't just release that, and certainly can't sell it. They could allow us to use UDK, but would have to release scripts that automate the export etc. for us. Scripts are much less likely to sell than a binary, so justifying the use of money on them is harder for an executive, and they would have to at least adapt them if not write them from scratch to make them reasonably usable.  Next up comes the issue of where these maps would be run. They would have to allow server leasers to upload maps to their servers (requiring additional space on the Internap Success Story™ servers they likely have to pay more for). The only other options is having someone review community maps and add the ""good ones"" through a patch (too expensive, as they've reiterated over and over and...) or give up the dedicated server, at which point their entire monetization strategy crumbles.  As much as I'd love to see map tools or better yet mod tools, it just doesn't work with a F2P game, and is certainly not free/easy with a 3rd party engine/tool chain.",™

I go hunting through the daily thread to find them, because they make me smile when almost nothing else does. Thank you, guys. You are all so awesome. &lt;3  In other news, I had my psych appointment today. We talked about  a lot of things, including my increased mood stability, severe depression and lack of sleep/eating. He upped the dosages of the meds I am on. He is also going to try to get in contact with some therapist colleagues of his so I can get into therapy sooner. Fingers crossed. Hopefully this is the light at the end of the tunnel. I love you guys! *Hugs* ♥  ",♥

Hyphengate rears it's ugly head over whether or not Upside Down contains a hyphen (spoiler alert: it doesn't). A quick discussion ensues on the the 3 laws of Planitotics^TM and how awesome opening exposition is.  * First rule of Upside Down, don't watch Upside Down. * Second rule of Upside Down, don't watch Upside Down.   Just how awesome are floating pancakes made of pink goo? Also, that pink goo can make you lose your wrinkles, but how does it work? We have another showing of the Elliot-Hallie Improv Song Show^® . The implications of stamp collecting. Pee Scene^TM makes its triumphant return with the introduction of the Pee Alarm^TM . Just how did Krimpsten Stunts lose and then regain her memory? A lot more goo talk ensues and the physics of baby birth and tri-d pools and the abrupt ending of the movie. Hamburgers eating people is terrible. Upside Down sex and the Coney Island Whitefish are discussed.  ##Pros/Cons:  **Pros for Upside Down**:  * Looks beautiful  **Cons**:  * Story is so bad it makes leaves you time to ponder the physics of this world.  * The movie doesn't make the audience care about the characters. The characters don't really exist in the world. * Movie seems to move fast but slow at the same time.  ##Movie ideas:  * Downside Up 2: World Walkers. Two babies can bounce between the worlds according to an ancient prophecy. There's a dragon and a reformed racist who goes from not believing in the world walkers to thinking they're all right because they save him from a rebel's bullet.  ##Mispronunciations:  * Kristen Dump * Dunston checks in * Kirken Munz * Krispen Gunts  ##Final Judgments:  * Hallie: ***Bad*** bad movie * Elliott: ***Bad*** bad movie * Dan: ***Bad*** bad movie * Stuart: ~~Good great movie~~ ***Bad*** bad movie  ## Flop House Movie Letters:  * Chad (possibly the country) discusses the awesome characters and plot of the Flop House and the future of the podcast. * A discussion on race relations and the volcano trend of the 90s, with a question about social messages in movies by Amy which all leads into Clive Owen's return to the podcast for an uncountable....th time. * Danielle expresses her love of the podcast and her son's obsession with the show. * Finally, a litany of complaints including numbering system, the podcast's self promotion, and the proper grammatical usage of masturbation from O.

t5_2qt55,Please_Pass_The_Milk,1379046151,"&gt;I'm not conditioned for anything!  Well you defended against an attack I didn't make, so your options are ""conditioned,"" ""illiterate,"" or ""not very smart,"" I just went with the nicest of the three.  &gt;It's become popular to hate on crossfit in the general fitness community  No. No it has not *become* popular to hate on crossfit. It has been popular to hate on crossfit since 2000, when what used to be called ""Aerobic Weight Training"" was trademarked as CrossFit™. Aerobic Weight Training, for the uninformed, was banned in most serious weightlifting gyms due to the incredible strain on equipment and remarkable risk to the athletes involved. CrossFit™ was an attempt to legitimize Aerobic Weight Training and gain acceptance in the weight training community.  It failed. *Dramatically*.  Crossfit has, since 2000, been so fully and thoroughly ostracized from the weight training community that they have had to form their own gyms and promote the system relentlessly in order to make up for the amount of ""crossfitters"" who maim themselves annually as well as those who quit after realizing how easy it is to do so.  &gt;""crossfit"" is such a general term that it's really impossible to say that it is inherently bad  CrossFit™ is a trademark of CrossFit, Inc. and if you form a CrossFit gym or offer significant CrossFit classes without permission from Crossfit, Inc. then they will *sue you into the ground*. CrossFit is therefore as general a term as Mickey Mouse or Wal-Mart, which is to say that it is a very specific term with a legally-supported definition and you are hilariously wrong.  &gt;while there are many many shitty cf gyms out there, there are some great ones too.  A great CrossFit gym is, definitionally, a gym that strays dramatically from the basis of CrossFit and therefore does not encourage their patrons to engage in reckless behavior on gym equipment.  &gt;The gym I currently go to is the best I have ever seen, they produce competitive athletes  No, actually. Crossfit is so incredibly poor an exercise regimen for any specific purpose that the CrossFit Games exist pretty much exclusively to make people who do CrossFit feel like they have done something useful to make up for the life-threatening injuries they've put themselves at risk of. CrossFit tends to build muscles that are only really useful in CrossFit (in addition to ones traditional training builds) and therefore legitimate athletes rarely have training regimens that do more than slightly overlap with CrossFit.  &gt;And you know what? This isn't really traditional crossfit  That goes without saying, you did after all say the gym was good.  &gt;they use a methodical calculated approach to your strength and conditioning goals, and every movement has a purpose, traditional crossfit is random and includes a lot of ""stupid human tricks""  What you are saying here is more or less exactly what I'm saying. Crossfit is very, very dumb and very, very dangerous. No decent gym with educated staff would ever let you do any of the advanced routines suggested in the CrossFit training materials. *Ever*. They're incredibly unsafe and not significantly better (and in many cases significantly worse) than similar ""traditional"" exercises.  &gt;It's popular to hate on crossfit because hurr durr injuries  If you take a *hurr durr* approach to injuries then you shouldn't be training. You only have one body, and a lot of the *very fucking legitimate* complaints against crossfit are that it can destroy you *permanently* in ways you wouldn't expect. Honestly, the phrase ""hurr durr injuries"" appearing in your post is enough for me to say you're not interested in athletic training on any legitimate level and therefore completely unprepared for any debate on this topic.  &gt;most crossfitters are cocky assholes that don't represent the community well  And here you're outright wrong. Read [this website](http://www.crossfit.com/). Tell me that it's not ""cocky as hell"".  *That is your training bible*. Those are the people who *write your exercises*. Crossfitters who are cocky as hell aren't misrepresenting ""the community"", they're doing *exactly as thee company that runs CrossFit would have them do*.  And no, I will not check out your gym, because I have my own gym and a training pattern specifically built to my needs, wants and desires (and my specific body) that has nothing to do with a multi-thousand dollar annual license for the word CrossFit.",™

t5_2s7tt,lolzergrush,1379046297,"Well you're ahead of the curve on that one, a 6-month project is enough to start getting a feel for whether or not you like it. Was it during or after college? Either way, kudos for getting your feet wet. It's about the 6-month mark where you either decide you hate it and can't wait to get back or you love it and can't imagine doing anything else.  I pretty much went with anyone I could go with, which was great for a while but then stagnated. I had some pretty bad experiences with tiny NGOs and I won't mention them because it would be badmouthing a former employer (plus they're small enough that they'd know who did it). Most important thing I can tell you - **make sure that whoever you work for can get you out if the shit hits the fan**. If you're cut out for this kind of work, then you're probably the kind of person that wants to be in the thick of it, but the fact is when things get *really* bad then you basically end up as another refugee and at that point you're no good to anyone.  It might be worth it to work at a firm a couple years. Get some time in water/wastewater, hydrology, and project management - if you have to pick only one, choose the latter. Save up money and put yourself through some sort of survival training. Practical courses help too - language (Kiswahili, French), welding, auto mechanic, bush driving.  A master's is pretty important, either in engineering (MCE/ME/MSE), or in public health (MPH/MSPH), or even in business (MBA). At the very least, do some coursework - parasitology is gold, but you can find others too. I lucked out with a course on tropical medicine taught by an MD/PhD that was half med students and half laymen - you can find classes like that if you look around. Graduate-level courses in biological processes and physical/chemical processes (or their equivalent), *especially* if your undergrad focus was not on water/wastewater. Some universities offer grad courses specifically for technologies appropriate for developing countries - take them.  Spend a few years working and go for your PE if you have time, it's meaningless in Africa but it carries a lot of weight in the job search...it's funny, the more money you *could* earn stateside, the more NGOs want to hire you for next to nothing. I went to a small firm near my hometown for my first job out of college - since it wasn't a Big Corporate firm, I was able to make project manager in six months, trial by fire basically. Most important thing is to work under a PE's supervision. Getting credit towards a PE (or [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_%28UK%29) if you're from the UK) is really, really, really tough when in Africa and it's hard to go back to it. If *at all possible*, put yourself through training with [RedR](http://www.redr.org.uk/en/Training-and-more/), it's the only real endorsement I've ever made in my life and it's done without hesitation.  Getting into it kinda sucks...what our profession does is *by definition* the difference between a developed and developing country, but there really isn't a defined career path and I wish like hell that there had been. You can't exactly show up to a Career Fair and find a booth saying ""Hey want to spend the next decade living on field corn and makande? You can get malaria, Guinea worm, *all different kinds* of diarrhea, maybe even get shot a few times, work sunrise to sunset seven days a week for pay that's a tiny fraction of what people you went to school with are getting and everyone calls you 'irresponsible' because you dedicated your life to something other than a mortgage."" Somehow I don't think it would be a popular career booth...the closest you ever get is Peace Corps which is more like ""Hey come spend the next two years working on a project no one takes seriously and no one expects you to complete because you're all new grads with zero funding and the understanding that this is just a time gap until you come back to Real Life™.""  We really, really need more civil engineers out there; I'd say more than any other profession. So many African cultures place a strong emphasis on education, more so than most people realize, but unfortunately most of the people who *are* able to get educated have a [tendency to leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_drain), especially when it comes to civil engineers for some reason. The third world won't ever stop being the third world at this rate, and I'd hate to be the guy to tell Kofi Annan that his goal of 2020 was just a little too ambitious.",™

t5_2cneq,derpymcgoo,1379069574,"Ron Paul is a joke.  Despite claiming how different he is and how he believes in individual liberties and limited government, he's exactly the same as other conservatives.  In fact, he was actually one of the more disingenuous congressman.  While he voted against big spending bills and pork, he stuck his own earmarks on things all the time.  Even worse, he stuck earmarks on things that he knew would pass and then voted against them so that it didn't hurt his ridiculously manipulated voting record.  For instance, he voted against federal aid to tornado or hurricane victims because it's not the federal governments job to subsidize living in dangerous natural disaster prone areas.  Except when his own district is damaged by a hurricane.  Then it's 100% ok because he's just ""returning money that the federal government stole"".  That might make sense if his district wasn't one of the highest per-capita federal spenders in the country.  If you can guess, that means they take a lot more federal money than they pay.  He also is fully willing to ignore the cognitive dissonance between his ""ideology"" and the conservative standard line.  For instance, he's against a federal ban on abortion but he was all for legally making life legally begin at conception at the federal level.(effectively making abortions illegal because, you know, murder)  Making something illegal under federal law is totally different than banning it at the federal level.  That makes sense.  Oh and the bill also would have made it so that federal courts, including the supreme court, did not have jurisdiction on anything to do with abortion.  That sounds like a good law to me...(and no it was not a constitutional amendment, although he supports that too)  Ron Paul thinks the government shouldn't be involved in defining marriage.  Except when it goes against longstanding conservative beliefs.  He cosigned a bill that would make the entire judicial branch unable to make rulings on the treatment of gay marriage across state boundaries.  That totally sounds like someone who believes in the constitution.  This cognitive dissonance gets even stranger.  So he's completely willing to effectively ban abortion at the federal level due to the individual rights of the fetus.  However, getting rid of segregation at the federal level is not ok due to ""individual liberty""™.  In fact his argument against segregation completely opposes his argument for a ban on abortion.  In 1997, he even proposed a flag burning amendment.  For those of you who don't know, this was actually a fairly popular idea in the mid 90's to the early 2000's.  He tried to remove protection of protected political speech because he didn't like it.  Later, in 2003, he voted against a flag burning amendment on the grounds that it should be a state right.  So determining what constitutes protected speech is a state right.  That's an interesting idea considering there is no way in hell that fits in with any half coherent idea of ""individual liberty"".  The whole point of protected political speech is that it's always ok.  He's an opportunistic hypocrite that relies on an uneducated voter base.  He's all image and no substance.  And no, saying all politicians are just as bad or worse isn't going to help your argument.",™

It will be the best place to enjoy games on by virtue of having the largest market of gamers.  Again, install base is EVERYTHING for a new console.  If the Xbone™ does not get enough of an install base by 2015, eg, if it stays at a 4:1 PS4/Xbone™ ratio on amazon charts worldwide, then there is a real risk that a new CEO of Microsoft will kill, sell or mothball the entire platform.

t5_2sml9,Sambuccaneer,1379082948,"Consider a purchasing department in which the equivalent of 10 full-time people [the resource supplied] are committed to processing purchase orders [the activity performed]. If the monthly cost of a full-time employee is $2,500,^ the monthly cost of the activity, ""Process Purchase Orders,"" equals $25,000. Assume that each employee, working at practical capacity, can process 125 purchase orders per month, leading to an estimated cost of $20 for processing each purchase order.® Thus, the organization, each month, spends $25,000. This expenditure provides a capability to process up to 1,250 purchase orders [the activity availability] during the month. During any particular month, the department may be asked to process fewer purchase orders, say only 1,O(X). At an estimated cost of $20 /purchase order, the ABC system would assign $20,000 of expenses to the parts and materials ordered by the purchasing department that month. The remaining $5,000 of monthly operating expenses represents the cost of unused capacity in the purchase order processing activity. This example shows why companies need two different reporting systems. The periodic financial statements provide information on the cost of activities supplied each period (the $25,000 monthly expense in the purchasing department); and the activity-based cost system provides information on the quantity (1,000 purchase orders) and the estimated cost ($20,000) of activities actually used in a period. The difference ($5,000) between the cost of activities supplied ($25,000) and the cost of activities used ($20,000) equals the cost of unused capacity (or capacity shortage) during the period. And this difference is measured for each organizational activity, defined by the ABC system.''

t5_2qh1f,Kichigai,1379093321,"&gt; Well, it isn't inconceivable that iBeacons could enable and enhance existing all-digital payment solutions like Square Wallet.  Well, first off, *all* electronic payment services these days are digital. Unless you're paying with cash, pretty much all transactions are digital (even checks, which are eventually converted into electronic transmissions of funds).  But I don't really see how iBeacons could help out much in this case, other than providing more accurate location information. As it is, Square only requires you to be within a few hundred meters, which existing Skyhook-like Wifi location tech already accomplishes.  &gt; Same could be said of check-in systems that currently utilize NFC.  Except NFC doesn't work that way. You don't check in. That'd be like checking in with your credit card. You don't. You just take it out, and use it to make a purchase, either by swiping or tapping at the point of sale. That's it, that simple.  &gt; Still, unless Apple pushes hard to standardize this profile (lol)  It's already been standardized. It was developed and standardized by the [NFC Forum](http://www.nfc-forum.org/home/), much like A2DP was developed and standardized by the [Bluetooth® Special Interest Group](https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us). These technologies weren't invented by LG or Samsung and then implemented all ad hoc. It was all put together by the NFC Forum, and then component manufacturers started building chipsets, and then manufacturers of devices started putting them into their devices. That simple.  &gt; it is doomed to niche status, no matter the additional convenience.  Except NFC is already in wide use, just not in phones. It's used in major [transit systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE#Transportation), [event ticketing](http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?9501), [credit cards](http://www.smartcardalliance.org/pages/publications-proximity-mobile-payments), [children's toys](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/42659/how-do-the-skylanders-figurines-work), and [security cards](http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?10649) to name a few off the top of my head. There's also more than [fifty million NFC-enabled units of one particular model of phone](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324077704578358283252725470.html) out in the world already, and the companies that have committed to the tech don't seem to be ready to give it up.  You could have made the same arguments about Wifi and Bluetooth back in their early days. It's a new technology, people are still figuring out how to use it.",®

t5_2qorf,andjok,1379094478,"All the anarchists© I've talked to seem to equivocate libertarian private property based on homesteading with statist private property, which is often acquired through plunder and privilege.  I always seem to get the line of reasoning of, ""current private property is based on plunder and privilege, therefore private property is bad.""  I'm pretty sure they also believe that any improved land can be owned by the people that improve or use it.  The major difference that I have found between anarchists© and ancaps is that they only see ownership as legitimate insofar as you continue to mix your labor and can prove ownership in that way, whereas ancaps think that resources can be potentially owned in perpetuity (though I personally think there should be some standard for property abandonment).  But anyways, I'm guessing anarchists see land ownership as just pointing to a piece of land and saying, ""that's mine, this piece of paper says so"" and therefore illegitimate and that's why they don't like it.  But really, I don't know, and I'm sure many of them have different ideas of ownership, that's just what it seems from discussions I've had.",©

Know that this is normal. In time it will slowly start to suck less until you get better and over her. So this is what you are up against.   Now to shorten the healing time you have some things you can do.  The most important is No Contact™. Get her as much out of your life as possible. Block her on Facebook and other social media.  Make sure you can't see her page.  If you don't have her number memorized, delete it from your phone. Call your carrier and block her number.  This isn't just don't talk to her, but make it as difficult as you can to contact her or her contact you.  You will have moments of weakness.   Next we are improving you. Physical exercise is the best place to begin so hit the gym. Or if you already do that, take up rock climbing as a hobby. Not only are you going to look better but the exercise can help with the pain.   Hang out with friends as much as you can. They can be great support, keep you from feeling lonely with her gone, and take your mind off of her.   Start a new hobby or learn a new skill.  Something so she isn't consuming your thoughts.   And finally, you don't need to her reason she broke up.  It won't give you closure and it will probably be a lie to try and let you down more easily.  This is what you need to know: she doesn't want to be with you anymore.   And while not actually the really important advice, the saying, ""The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" has a little bit of truth to it.   ",™

t5_2to41,Revelgoodpeople,1379132416,"My post from Man Whores and Lady Sluts of Reddit, What is the sleaziest/sluttiest thing you've ever done? (nsfw)   I have one and only one great and horrifying story. About 4 months ago I was at my friends house, We've been friends a decent amount of time probably a year or so. It's about 10 at night, only her and her mother are home. Father works in over night security or something, Idk.  Anyhow after 3 consecutive shots each, my friend and I begin making out, She takes out my dick sucks it, I go down on her and then she gets in the doggy position and we start fucking. At this point we're both fairly twizzled™ I'm fucking her and then I hear the door open behind me, There stands the mother, I freeze up like a deer in head lights and my friend does the same pulling the covers over her. The mother walks over and gives me 2 options.  I can leave and she'll tell her husband. (Daddy is not only a gun enthusiast, but loves his daughter to death). She's going to join us and she won't say a word. I look at my friend and she decides for me and starts sucking my dick again with the mother undressing in front of me then joins her daughter on the bed swapping spit and sucking my dick. At this point I'm 2 things, 1 - Fearing for my life, and 2 - the most horny I've ever been. So Now I have them both right in front of me on the bed in doggy position, of course I plunge into mama first. I want to please her so I can escape with my life so I'm fucking the shit out of her while I finger the daughter next to her, a good 15 minutes of continuous rock hard effort later, the mother squirts like she hasn't had an orgasm in 20 years. My entire crotch and front of my legs are now dripping, I pull out and think alright, I paid my dues.   (Wrong) She demands I fuck her daughter while she watches. So I start fucking the daughter again. Mid hump I two hands on my ass and i feel my cheeks being spread apart. I'm panicking a little, but it's soon soothed as she begins to lick my ass. Shortly after the daughter cums, I pull my dick out the mother starts sucking me till I cum. Afterward She throws me my pants and tells me to get out asap. I manage to put my boxers on and run out with my shirt / pants in my hand. TL;DR Life or death mother daughter pussy.  I can't stress enough how real this actually was, and how much I wish I could have enjoyed it.",™

Why would their wealth and political influence not rise to the stratosphere as time marches dutifully into infinity?  Given a long enough time frame I could imagine a future in which, say, the top .001% possess the resources to essentially design reality at will, travel instantly across the universe, and demand whatever standards of labor they like best from the rest of the population.

It currently provides  free-to-the-public online read-only access, in non-downloadable format, to 28 standards,  including every single standard referenced in laws or codes. This includes all the ASHRAE  Standards listed on Exhibit C. This access is provided through a service called RealRead®.  ASHRAE incurs significant costs in order to provide such access.  &gt;STM has created a reading room on its website, available at  http://www.astm.org/READINGLIBRARY/index.html, through which the public can access all  ASTM standards that have been incorporated by reference into federal regulations at no cost on a  read-only basis. That is, members of the public may access the standards online and view them  at no cost, but are not able to copy or modify them. Additionally, when a federal agency  proposes to incorporate by reference an ASTM standard in rulemaking, ASTM works with the  relevant agency to provide the public with read-only access to the standard at no cost during the  public comment period.  104. As part of its commitment to enhancing public safety, NFPA began making the  full text of NFPA standards available for free viewing on its website, in read-only form, more  than a decade ago. NFPA currently provides such access for all of its standards, including many  older editions that are still referenced in laws. See http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/list_of_codes_and_standards.asp. This access allows any  member of the public, including citizens of jurisdictions that have incorporated NFPA standards  by reference, to review NFPA standards without cost.

t5_2qh0u,charms4ever,1379165642,"he idea behind the formula was to create a product that when applied to the skin it received the benefits of tightening, toning and firming &amp; to reduce the appearance of skin slackening. It works adopted this Formula 11 yrs. Ago however prior to that formula was used in  Spa's  &amp; several exclusive spas for over 12 yrs. to keep is affordable and accessible and easy to use the ""cloth"" was created to make application easy &amp; mess free. Applicator cloth allow you to select site specific areas of the body you wish to se results. Skin is the largest living organ in the body, everything we put on our skin begins absorbing in our bodies in as little as 26 seconds. The Ultimate Body Applicator is a safe &amp; Natural DETOXIFICATION Wrap. Not a compression or water loss wrap. Applicator begins the process of allowing extra toxins in the fat cell to be released. Applicator continues to work through your body for 72 hours. Stay well hydrated over the next 3 days. The more you drink the more you shrink  The product that  tightens, tones, and firms any trouble spot in as little as 45 Try it cause it ""WORKS""                            ♦What is the Body Applicator Wrap. The wrap consists of an all-natural herbal blend that absorbs through your pores into your fat cell. It detoxifies and breaks down the fat in the cell and extracts fat and toxins into your lymphatic system, which is then disposed as waste. This detoxifying method reduces the size of the fat cell, resulting in inch loss, toning, and minimizing the site of cellulite.   Shower and exfoliate the area you want to wrap (a loofah works great), opening up the pores and removing any dead skin cells. DO NOT use bar soap, it clogs the pores, and avoid lotions where you wrap as they also clog the pores. Choose the area you want to focus on, Open the wrap and apply the lotion side against the skin where you want to focus on, and smooth out the wrap. Wrap that area securely (snug) with saran wrap or spandex so the wrap doesn't move around; the wrap's herbal blend will not stain clothing. Leave the wrap on for at least 45 minutes, up to 8 hours. Once you remove the wrap, dispose of it and rub the remaining lotion into your skin. You can shower a few hrs later. To obtain the best results, wear the wrap for 8 hours. (If you wear the wrap to bed, be sure to drink plenty of water for the first 2 hours.  when Applying the wrap  For the next 3 days, stay away from fatty or processed foods, sugar, coffee, soda and  NO ALCOHOL  And WATCH YOUR SALT INTAKE. Do not SMOKE (anything) The wrap is doing it’s job, you need to do your part to achieve the absolute best results possible! You can’t eat like crap and go out and party and expect to keep your results or continue to have results.  You are releasing the toxins in your fat cells, you do not want to ADD MORE TOXINS!   ♦  Do not exercise for at least 8 hours after your wrap. You want to make sure the lotion is completely absorbed into your skin. This wrap does not work by sweating!   ♦  Do not shower immediately after you wrap! Give yourself several hours before you take a shower.   ♦  Ladies Do Not wrap when it’s “that time of the month”. There is something in the hormonal imbalance during that time that diminishes results. The wrap may not work at all during your period or taking medications. Plan your wraps accordingly! Regarding medications, if you have questions, take a wrap with ingredients to your doctor and ask.   ♦  Do Not wrap again for 72 hours! The botanical-blend in one wrap continues to work over the course of 72 hours (3 days). Your results will progress over this time.  ♦  Wrap only 2 areas @ the same time. Depending on the size of your arms/legs, the wrap can be cut in half and placed in the desired location.  ♦It is very important to drink plenty of water to flush the toxins out of your body. If possible, experts say the best results come from drinking 1/2 your weight in ounces. (i.e. If you weight 140 lbs, drink 70 ounces a day during the 72 hour detox period.) Doing this will fully flush the toxins, and allow you to obtain the best results. Just do the best you can and know there is a purpose!  What Can You Do to Achieve Better Results? Some of our dietary supplements, such as Greens, and fat fighter can help improve results by working to detoxify your body. Using these supplements can help you achieve better results with the Ultimate Body Applicator, results are both immediate and progressive. With each treatment you will continue to see Results  ♦RESULTS ARE PERMANENT as long as you maintain sensible eating habits. Your excess fat will not come back. But is safe enough for monthly use as maintenance if preferred!. And I recommend using the defining gel long term, but once you try it, you will see why!

He said they have certain requirements that are bullying. For instance, you can't just sell nice american axes; you first have to buy a certain amount of crappy cheapie Squires and Mex strats and teles and basses before they allow you to buy one of the high-end guitars wholesale. They force you to buy guitars you don't want. The customers don't want them so they sit there and gather dust.  You're just paying for the name with those brands. You can build a better guitar yourself with kits and pay a tech and/or luthier to build it and set it up. Custom shop quality for half the price.

t5_2qhnf,ComicDebris,1379174945,"I think that the act of taking a picture, or even the thought ""I need to preserve an image of this thing or this moment"" can take some focus away from being in the present moment and fully experiencing things. I also don't think it's a big problem unless you're too obsessed with the photos - *need* to take them, worry excessively about losing them, or disrupt pleasant times by always making people pose or making people wait while you adjust your macro settings to get that flower in focus.   I think photography is a great art form because it deals with Things As They Are™ and, as you said, it shows us how simple things are beautiful. You might see a billion leaves when you walk through a park, but when you see a photograph of a leaf you pay attention to it, because some photographer paid attention to it first and decided it was worth sharing.   I'm babbling and I don't know if I'm saying anything helpful so I'll sum up - photography can either take you out of the moment or bring you deeper into it. Figure out how you're using it.  ",™

t5_2qhp5,fallacybuffet,1379181139,"First, I apologize for the x/post from */r/Seattle*.  This topic is huge there because the city requires about 1.5 parking spaces per new apartment unit, which raises the rent by about one-third.  They are experimenting with high-density (micro-apartments, or ""Apodments™) buildings that require fewer new parking spaces if the building is near public transit.  This makes conversion of abandoned industrial buildings to residential financially feasible.  Los Angeles did the same thing a few years ago.    Ed: Correct [link](http://daily.sightline.org/2013/08/22/apartment-blockers/) to an interesting article written by an urban economist about the true cost of parking spaces at residential buildings.",™

The issue isn't with the windshield.  The cable itself must have a bad connection because MOST of the time the traffic does not show on the device.  Once in a while it kicks in and works again.  But the bigger problem is that very often the FM traffic signal takes so long to get updated that I'm already stuck in the ""red"" before the ""red"" shows on my device.",®

They're not saving themselves any traffic. Because in the same ""update"" where they changed the site to make it largely impossible to let a video buffer, they also introduced the bug where clicking back to a position earlier in the video will now cause YouTube to reload the shit that it's already downloaded all over again.  And even if that weren't so, even if they had done it right, there should still be a ""buffer all the way"" checkbox.  Frankly, every time I encounter something Google these days, it's something they've made worse. Almost every change to their existing products lately is change for change's sake that makes things worse. My conclusion is that Google as a whole is now incompetent.

All of the evidence is that smokers *will not* be persuaded that way.  The more relevant comparative case of prohibition is not alcohol from the 20's, but marijuana in the present. Consider how many lives have been ruined by the ongoing irrational prohibition of a plant that causes far less harm than even alcohol.

I also used the $200 in airline ""fee"" reimbursements and the $100 refund for global entry, which are both very nice (""fee""s accidentally include gift certificate purchases). Many of us got in on the 100,000 MR points signup offer back in January -- if you have time to wait, you can sometimes see these offers. The benefits combined outweighed the annual fee (at least for the first year) for me.     If you don't have time to wait, the best current signup offer I've seen is for 50K MR points after $3k in purchases. However, this requires not having the gold card (or other similar products) in the past 90 days. So you'd have to cancel your current gold card and wait 90 days. Here's the exact text: ""Welcome bonus not available to applicants who have had a Platinum Card within the last 12 months or any Consumer ZYNC®, Green or Gold Card account within the last 90 days.""    Finally, you may get a retention offer when attempting to close the Gold card (such as 10K MR points or something like that) -- so at the least, attempting to cancel may give you a nice benefit there.    To answer your specific questions:   1. Doesn't matter, or barely matters at all   2. They might (they're required to inform you if so), and definitely if you are a new sign up vs. just an upgrade.   3. See above -- look for nice sign up bonuses is my best advice.  ",®

That's fine, I have no problem with that. It's a sandbox right now, have fun! However, there no point in complaining that it's difficult, or that the game right now isn't really set up for 300 part monsters, as you're using the game for something it isn't really designed to be.

t5_2sokd,Capitan_Failure,1379217516,"Have you ever considered that counting by 10 or one hundred is not actually the most efficient way to do things?  We live in a world that has a base 10 number system, that means that at the 10th number, the digits reset, (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10) but other than the fact that we typically have 10 fingers, there is no legitimate reason for this.  We could create two more single digit numbers and work off of a base 12 (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-♀-☼-10), or we could take off 3 single digit and work off of a base 6 (1-2-3-4-5-6-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-20).

t5_2qhqx,gfixler,1379251117,"They're quite different, but there's a tiny bit of overlap. There are far more digraphs in Vim than I've seen XCompose defaults. I've used the latter for about 5 years with some regularity, and I toyed with Vim's digraphs for awhile a couple of years ago. In Vim, `co` or `oc` will give me `℅`, but with compose, `oc` gives me `©`, and `co` gives me `ǒ`. Either ordering with capitals gives me an unprintable `&lt;9d&gt;` char in Vim's digraphs, but with compose I get `©` for both.  Digraphs use `I` to mean 'invert,' so `¿` is `?I` in digraphs, while it's `??` in compose, where doubling often means invert. `??` in digraphs is just a `?`, and `?I` in compose yields `Ỉ`. `¶` in digraphs is either `pp` or `PI`, but is `PP` in compose, where `pp` and `PI` do nothing. Umlauts in digraphs use `:`, so `o:` gives `ö`, and the `""` gives you whatever the `""` above `ő` - made with `o""` - is. In compose, `o""` is how to make `ö`, and `o:` does nothing at all.",©

t5_2s64w,stadiumrat,1379273630,"**Slow Cooker Red Beans and Rice**  ©From the Kitchen of Deep South Dish  Prep time: 10 min |Cook time: 7 hours |	Yield: About 4 to 6 servings  Ingredients  1 pound of dried, Camellia brand red kidney beans  3 slices of bacon, chopped  2 cups of chopped onion  1 cup of chopped bell pepper  1/2 cup of chopped celery  2 cloves of garlic, minced  Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste  1 teaspoon dried basil  1 large bay leaf  1/2 tablespoon of olive oil, vegetable or canola oil  1/2 pound of andouille or spicy smoked sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices  1 meaty ham bone or 2 ham hocks  7 cups of hot water  Kosher salt to taste, if needed  Cayenne pepper, to taste, optional  Hot, cooked rice  Sliced green onion, for garnish, optional  Cajun seasoning and hot sauce, for the table  Instructions:  Rinse and sort beans and use a quick boil method before adding them to the slow cooker. Put them in a pot, bring to a boil, boil for 10 minutes, drain and transfer to a 6 quart slow cooker.  In a separate skillet, cook the bacon until the fat is rendered. To that, add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and sauté until the veggies are tender. Add the garlic, black pepper, basil and bay leaf into the vegetable mixture, stir together and transfer to the slow cooker. Add the oil to the skillet and saute the sausage until browned. Transfer to the slow cooker. Add the ham bone. If using ham hocks, use a knife to cut slashes into the fat before adding to the slow cooker.  Add 7 cups of heated water, cover and cook for 5 to 7 hours on high, or until beans are tender and cooked through completely. Remove 1 cup of the beans, draining the liquid back into the slow cooker. Mash beans to form a paste and stir back into the beans. Taste, add salt as needed, and cayenne pepper, to taste, if desired. Scoop over hot, cooked rice, and serve with fresh French bread. Garnish with sliced green onion, if desired, and pass Cajun seasoning and hot sauce at the table.   Cook's Notes: Do not consume raw or undercooked kidney beans. Because there are concerns with potentially undercooking kidney beans when made in a slow cooker, I recommend using the boil method of pre-soaking to rid the beans of any toxins. I also recommend cooking them on high instead of low. Taste and add salt only once beans are fully cooked, and then only if it needs it. For extra richness, add up to 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) of butter and stir in at the end. If you pre-soak your beans, you'll need to increase the water so that they cover the beans by about an inch or so.

Kundalini is a method of manipulating the mind and body to build ""kundalini energy"" - what that is hard to describe unless you actually experience it but maybe it's easy to describe, it feels like orgasm. Kundalini yoga has the well-deserved reputation for being the yoga of increasing sexual energy.  For those into yoga, I'll describe my experience at kundalini practice last night, as kundalini is pretty different from other styles of yoga (this ain't your parents hot yoga practice ...):  I entered the studio early, since I'm a big guy I like to stake out a mat space where I'll have room to move around without bumping into someone. It's a small space, intimate and cozy in the half-dark candlelight. I assume child's pose and begin to calm my mind for meditation. People walk in over the next ten minutes and when I come out of the pose I look around. There about twenty other people in this class. They're all women, mostly really fit, hot twenty somethings but there are a few older and/or heavier women in class too. Wow, I think this is the first yoga class I've taken at my studio where I'm the only guy in the room. It makes me feel special :)  The physical intensity in kundalini flows through the session like a sine way, starting low, building higher, then decreasing back to a final rest. We start in silence, rotating circles with the spine and doing various seated movements to gradually awaken muscles up and down the spinal column. All our movements are co-ordinated with deep and powerful breathing. There are quite a few people with amazing ujjayi breathing technique in the room full of people starts to sound like rolling ocean waves. Our teacher's voice is so gentle, calm and sweet that it's making the hairs on my arms tingle slightly.  The energy builds and we move to standing work. This time chanting a mantra in unison with our movements. For example, we move our hands in front of us in a big circle, starting at the heart and inhaling with an out and up movement. With this movement we chant ""har!"". Then with a sharp exhale we chant ""hari!"". The chanting in kundalini often gives people pause ... it's weird stuff to be in a room full of people chanting what is loosely translated as ""God as the creative aspect of Infinity. Vishnua as redeemer and a guide to personal salvation."" It reminds me of scenes in Dune when they learn to use sound as a weapon. The purpose of the chanting is three fold. First, the physical aspect of kundalini is an _intense_ workout that causes the mind to panic or push ... the chanting calms the mind. Second, it actives muscles along the spinal column in the area of the vocal chords ... it's essential that all the muscles along the entire length of the spinal cord are activated and warmed up. Third, it causes the brain to release love hormones ... any form of group singing or chanting has a strong bonding effect and cause sharp releases of [feel good hormones like ocytocin](http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html). As I begin to fall into the trance like state of kundalini, eyes closed, the chanting blurs and it sounds like we are all crying, ""God! God! God! God!"".  We end the upper arm work with our first breath of fire. This is a breathing technique which ""screws"" with the oxygen flow to the brain and is the fuel for powerful trance like states. Our intense movements are punctuated by periods of calm. The body is rapidly switch from sympathetic to parathympathetic state during kundalini. I force myself to breath slowly and calmly in these brief rest periods, ensuring my inhale longer than the exhale for each of these five breath breaks. The heart is beating like a mofo, the mind is screaming to just fucking breath ragged and gasp n' shit but I'm no newb to this game and I maintain focus on controlling each and every breath under conscious control. I visualize a gentle lake and go to my happy place of bliss to encourage the calming moments to be all the more deeper. We're doing leg work and push-up work now, I'm covered in sweat and it's dripping down my face onto the matt. Shit is getting intense. We are still chanting mantras, they're the only thing that's holding me onto my breath control. The body is on fire. We do most of the movements with our eyes close, to focus on what's going on within the body, and with each powerful movement and chant I'm seeing tracers and patterns of exploding light and colour timed with the movements of my body. This is a state I've never reached in yoga for me and it feels amazing. My body feels like it's moving itself, like I've merely submitted my will to God/Universe and a fire within and beyond my control is moving my body. I'm awash in a state of bliss and ecstasy, the screaming of my muscles no longer screaming but just adding fuel to this overwhelming feeling of love. ",♥
t5_2rct2,kteague,1379274947,"Then we do another breath of fire, then the tunes are cranked up and a high-energy pop track is played. We begin to sprint in place on our matts, reaching peak intensity. Someone lets out a 'wooo-OOoOO!' and it's answered with many more of them. We howl primally as the intensity of energy in our bodies reaches climax. It feels so good to be alive and so awesome to call out in rich screams of ecstasy.  We're asked to look around the room and find a dance partner. There's a lady around my age beside me, I acknowledge her with prayer hands as the next track starts. She's fit and got some good moves as we kick our feet around and sway our hips to the beat. She doesn't have the most attractive face, there are deep worry lines in her forehead. She's a beginner at kundalini (her chanting was subdued and her breath at points was ragged) and I can see in her face she's expressing more fear and anxiety than bliss and joy. It doesn't matter, I'm so floating on so much energy that in this moment I'm beguiled by her beauty. I smile at her until she flickers a smile back. The thought crosses my mind that if I'd seen her profile on OKC I'd could easily be in a mood where I quickly hit ""next"" but in this moment her beauty is almost overpowering and she's deeply attractive and amply more beautiful than I'd expect to attract. I lose myself in the music, dancing in room full of beautiful women and beaming like a kid in a candy store.  We move back to laying on our matts and start to cool the energy. We lay on our backs and do core work. We move back and forth to tranquil love songs, the class encouraged to sing along to the words. We hold our arms over our heads at 60 degree angles as we sit and a track is played where kundalini guru Gurmukh is speaking about self-love and about dropping worry and fear and self-hypnosis into a state of love and happiness. It's a long track and I my arms are aching from holding them overhead and the muscles are giving out and the arms are trembling violently. I direct the energy to my fingertips and draw love into my heart and endure. Never give up, never let anyone down. Gurmukh's words ring through my brain, ""Healthy, happy and holy. Bountiful, beautiful and blissful."" as we finally lower our arms and are now sitting quietly in seated mediation  We lay down on our backs in shavasana and our teacher is talking about letting love into our hearts and my heart just releases and opens wide as fuck! Joy and wonder pour in and it feels like being bathed in an impossibly bright light. The feelings of love and joy are so powerful that my eyes mist over and a few tears roll out. If you've ever had a bad break-up or the death of close friend or family member, I'm sure you're familiar with that horrible feeling of your chest tightening up with sorrow and suffering. This was a feeling as powerful as any of the significant heartbreaks of my life, only it was the exact opposite. Instead of sorrow and closing, there was joy and opening. It felt like I could feel the muscles specifically around my heart relaxing. It was a such an incredible feeling!  Then we sang ""May the long time sun shine upon you"" and the class was over. I was sexually and emotionally charged and surrounded by woman. However, instead of us all getting naked in a big love orgy, everyone gathered up their stuff and went home :(. Wait ... lovely ladies ... stay ... have love and sex with me ... ah well. I rode my bike home, still energized from the experience. The simple pleasures of a bike ride are giving me such overwhelming happiness that I'm wiping away tears of joy the whole way home.  ♥♥♥  Anyways, we often hear talk about self-improvement on this sub. Eating better, working out more, dressing better and all that jazz, but it's less rare that we focus on self-acceptance. The art of giving yourself the permission to love yourself exactly as you are in this moment. Learning that we don't need someone else to make us feel love, we have that capacity already within ourselves. Every time we send out an unanswered message to a ""perfect"" match, every first date that fades, every short term relationship that blows up, our hearts close just a tiny bit more. We become more bitter and quick to ask, ""What's in it for me?"". It feels absolutely amazing to reverse that process and re-open up the heart.          ",♥

t5_2rfec,GamerLioness,1379297449,"&gt;Nonsense. Well, maybe some people think that, I dunno.  I guess you must be conveniently unaware of all the people who make posts and videos complaining about girls and women having the audacity to ""[demand] things change to suit them,"" as shown in the post you replied to.  &gt;The problem is that women who make feminist critiques speak with other people's voices.   So because I identify as a feminist, I'm not speaking with my own voice? Any time a woman says something that's seemingly feminist in nature, her argument should be discarded and ignored? Feminism isn't a monolith, and I can critique things however I want. The point of criticism is to *share one's opinion*, even if it's biased (and everyone is biased in some way, which isn't always a bad thing).  &gt;When you say ""I want to play this kind of game"" or ""I wish this game had a girl character"", that's your personal opinion and you're welcome to it. When you start saying ""This industry is Sexist(TM) and they need to make Equal(TM) games for Social Justice(TM)"" you're no longer offering a personal opinion, you're taking a political position and demanding social change, and implictly threatening to shame anyone who doesn't agree.  Do I have to repeat myself? Here, allow me to repost what you replied to: ""Breaking the mold is a good thing for all people who play games, because we get new, interesting games. Once again, this does not mean that other types of games will cease to exist."" In other words, **we are not asking for certain games to never be made; we are encouraging developers to take our opinions into consideration, which would serve both them and us**. No one is saying ""Do this because of Social Justice™."" We're saying ""Don't ignore us; we're part of the gaming demographic, too!""   Oh, and ""shaming"" people for ""disagreeing?"" If by ""people who disagree,"" you mean ""people who actively try to shut down the conversation by silencing us to maintain the status quo of something they're ridiculously territorial of,"" then I guess you'd be right. But really, you're accusing the silenced of being the silencers, and vice-versa.   &gt;You want to ask for more female characters or whatever? Fine, do it. But when you start saying that if the gaming industry doesn't give you what you want it's because they're all misogynist pig-men who love rape culture, yeah, that's where some of us have to draw the line.  Read my last post. I don't want to repeat myself again.  &gt;The standard response to an invasion.  The fact that they see it as an ""invasion"" is problematic. Games are becoming more ubiquitous, and many girls and women have been gaming for a long time. It's unwise to ignore a big chunk of consumers, and it's unfair that our concerns get dismissed with ""Well, you don't play games, anyway!"" Gee, if that were the case, we *wouldn't be offering our critiques to begin with!*  &gt;What a stupid thing to say. Yes, it was a men's space, or at least a primarily male space, and demographics are exactly the reason for that.  What a stupid thing to say. No, it was not a ""men's space"" simply for having a larger male demographic (which isn't even really the case anymore). Many girls had an NES, a SNES, a Game Boy, a PC, etc. growing up, and many of those girls became women and continue to play games (even if they weren't or aren't as vocal about it, lest they be accused of being ""fake geek girls""). Many school-aged girls today play Minecraft and build their Steam libraries. Once again, for companies to ignore and exclude such a huge chunk of consumers (and potential consumers) is holding the industry back.  Do you even know what a ""safe space"" *is*? Clue: It's not gaming. A safe space would be a place (such as a private message board or clubhouse) that people go to for support. You don't get to co-opt an entire medium as your ""male space"" so that you can exclude the icky girls out of your club. While you're at it, are you going to take movies, novels, art, and anything else you happen to like so that you don't have to share?  By the way, I'm a game designer, and my male co-workers don't seem to have a problem with me existing and sharing my ideas. Get over yourself.",™
t5_2rnve,iswinterstillcoming,1379297829,"&gt;NVIDIA® nForce 780a SLI  That's the motherboard's chipset. Yes, it technically determines what kind of graphics card you can use but it's not what you should be looking for. This was a time when Nvidia still makes chipsets for AMD (and Intel) motherboards. AMD haven't own ATI yet. They weren't competitors.  &gt; 3 x PCI Express 2.0 x16 slots  This is what you should be looking for. Yes, technically your motherboard can support a 7970. You just can't perform a crossfire with the Nvidia chipset. Hope you have a good CPU that goes along with the 7970 though or else your CPU would horribly bottleneck everything. Have at least a Phenom II X4 955. Those outdated DDR2 RAM would be a performance problem as well.",®

t5_2ti8z,opterionianiaco,1379310499,"[Zuergner Mining Method™](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEtBiTV5OdA)  It's the method all the top miners use.   **Equipment needed:**  * 1 Fortune III pick  * 2 Unbr III Eff V pick - You can take one, but two is playing it safe in case you don't find enough diamonds to repair. I usually only take one  * 1 Anvil  * 1 Workbench  * 1 Bucket Water - For dealing with lava   * 1 Fire Resistance Potion extended -  Because you failed to deal with lava properly and fell in (keep this on your hotbar at all times)  * Health Potions - optional, I like to take a few with me just in case I get swarmed by mobs or a creeper sneaks up on me, can heal up quickly and tp home.   * Invisibility Potions - Can be used so you can run while mining. I prefer sneaking and clearing a wider area  * Lots of food  **Do These Things**  * Mine diagonally, swinging your pick left to right. Make sure to do it real sexy like, as admins will be watching you (because you're finding so much bling). You should be clearing out an area about 5-8 blocks wide. I like to think of it as making a 2 high ravine.   * Manage your inventory. After a few minutes, you should have a bit of redstone, maybe some iron and gold, and if you're lucky some o those sweet sweet diamonds. Throw away all your cobble and spread the redstone out in your inv [like so](http://i.imgur.com/yo4lvNr.png). This makes it so you aren't wasting time throwing away cobble just to pick up more ores. I usually have 10 slots for redstone, and when the 10th stack is getting close to full I place my workbench and turn it the 9 full stacks into blocks.   * Mine (just about) everything. To repair your pickaxes while you're out mining, you're going to need about 35 levels. If you skip redstone while mining, it's unlikely you're going to get the necessary levels to repair and keep mining. Personally, I skip past most coal, as I have no problems getting the levels with redstone, but Zuergner yells at me and calls me rude names whenever I mention that I skip coal (he also says that he finds a lot of diamonds behind coal). You will need some coal to smelt eventually though, so don't ignore it entirely.   * Smelt. At some point your inventory will be so full of ores and blocks that you will have to craft blocks every few minutes or throw things away.  This is when it's time to smelt down the iron and gold you have and turn them into blocks. I don't take furnaces with me, but you already have a workbench and getting cobble is a breeze. If you can smelt in multiples of 9 do that, so you don't have any ingots, just blocks and ores. If you do end up with some ingots, it's OK to throw them away. It has to be 8 or less ingots, so it's not a big loss.    * Repair. When your pick is getting low, whip out that big beautiful anvil of yours and fix that baby up. Ooh that's some sexy repairing.   * Periodically do /f map to see if you're mining near someones base. With an eff 5 and haste 2, mining into a base you didn't notice can kill you before you even realise you're taking damage. Bases are stupidly OP in the current meta, and you should never lane against a base while playing miner. Just say GG and go jungle or something. Hopefully we see a nerf to bases in the next patch.

A chart (or just an explanation or whatever) of what character match-ups are good or bad along with various opinions on why the match-up is good/bad, especially any legitimate conflicting opinions.  3. Similar to #2, a chart illustrating what stages are good or bad for each character (all stages, not just tournament legal stages).  4. (Cobr and Mixarenan alluded to this) Videos of players watching/reviewing/critiquing their own matches while explaining what they did, why they did it, and (if needed) how they did it.  5. The rest of the hitboxes and non-attacking hurtboxes (such as while running and while ducking). Or, better yet (if possible), a guide on how to make the hitboxes/hurtboxes visible. Tutorials for other hacks would also be cool.  6. Controller discussion: what/where is the best/most consistent place to buy controllers, good deals on controllers (like good finds on CraigsList, eBay, yard sales, etc...), alternate controllers (examples: keyboard, xbox, hori mini pad, etc...), controller mod guide (change/mix colors, remove the *start* button, joystick replacement, etc...), different grips such as the ""claw"", and sexy pictures of naughty controllers looking hot as fuck.   7. A thorough and well articulated explanation of the current/up-to-date tournament ruleset.  8. Pictures/screenshots of Stranded's pouty face after losing.  9. The following combo videos: Samus true combos, DK dash attack combos, Kirby U-air combos, Saffron City pokémon combos, and Mushroom Kingdom POW block and/or piranha plant combos.  10.

On the other hand, the xbox controller is seemingly indestructible while it fits in my hands like a glove, better triggers imo too.

Cette femme, meme si elle est une conne, reste quand meme une personne, pas un objet.  deuxieme probleme: ""Cette charmante adepte de la Religion de Paix, d’Amour et de Tolérance™ "" - comment il sait que c'est une musulmane? Parce qu'elle a un nom arabe elle doit etre automatiqument musulmane? Elle a une photo ou il n'y a pas de voile ou burka. Une femme d'origine arabe qui trouve les quebecois racistes, ca ne veut pas dire qu'elle doit etre musulmane.  je suis blanc, pas religieux et je ne porte pas de signe religieux, donc cette charte ne va pas m'affecter du tout, mais je la trouve quand meme raciste.  aussi, ""Religion de Paix, d’Amour et de Tolérance™"" est une expression souvent utilisee par les racistes islamophobes. il y a beaucoup de gens qui critiquent l'islam, mais tres peu qui utilisent des phrases clé comme celle-la.  .  et il continue de la meme facon.  *""aimeriez-vous, en tant que citoyen d’un peuple qu’elle hait et méprise autant, être soigné par elle ? Particulièrement si vous avez déjà utilisé votre droit à la liberté d’expression pour critiquer la religion mahométane ?""*  je pensais que cette charte des ""valeurs"" etait contre toutes les religions et ne visait pas de facon directe les musulmans (ceci serait discriminaitoire et contre la charte des droits et libertes, non?)  alors quel est le rapport avec ""critiquer la religion mahométane"" ?  donc de mon point de vue, ce gars est un raciste xenophobe qui voit un message ecrit par une conne dont le nom est arabe, alors il part en croisade contre les musulmans et leur religion.  il est l'equivalent internet de la dame qui a physiquement attaque les arabes dans le centre d'achat (l'histoire de foulard gucci)  EDIT  plus sur l'auteur qui semble etre un peu special  http://lapresd.blogspot.ca/2008/04/maman-fais-moi-peur-eh-ben-la-petite.html  http://lys-dor.com/2012/02/19/un-partisan-damir-khadir-agresse-physiquement-daniel-lapres-des-amis-quebecois-disrael/    ",™

However you should only strip mine when you have no other option, such as the start of the map or if for some reason you don't have a base. Making a base with the basics should be prioritised over mining though, and most of the gear I listed is easy to get once you have an xp grinder and some cows/bookshelves.   I can not stress enough how much faster ZMM™ is than any other method. Obviously you'll need to do some strip mining to get a few diamonds to make your enchanted picks (a few more if you want to feel safer journeying to the nether for potion resources), but after that strip mining is just a waste of time.

I mean, religion mostly arose because people couldn't explain shit, and also because we're fucking terrified of dying and wanted to feel better about it. See ""The Invention of Lying"" for a fictional/modern account that honestly feels like it may well be how some religion came about  I fully agree with the NDT quote as follows:   Does it mean, if you don’t understand something, and the community of physicists don’t understand it, that means God did it? Is that how you want to play this game? Because if it is, here’s a list of things in the past that the physicists at the time didn’t understand [and now we do understand] [...]. If that’s how you want to invoke your evidence for God, then God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance that’s getting smaller and smaller and smaller as time moves on - so just be ready for that to happen, if that’s how you want to come at the problem.  ""The Moon, the Tides and why Neil DeGrasse Tyson is Colbert's God"". © 2007-2011 The Science Network. January 20, 2011.  I'm not trying to prove somehow that they're ultimately compatible, but what I think is that actually starting the ""war on religion"" that the wingnuts think has actually been going on isn't going to help a whole lot. Science and Religion are in conflict much of the time, but they're not really opposite sides of the same spectrum like people think.   It's possible for a person to accept science in full and take a ""god of the gaps"" stance, and then be fully willing to accept scientific explanations should they come.   I'd rather let people follow that route than tell them ""no, you can't believe that, you're dumb for doing so"" because all it does is push them further away from eventually accepting science and reality.

I never bothered anyone and I minded my own business much like OP in this story. So I never understood why I was the object of ridicule. It makes me both incredibly angry and seriously and  sincerely hurt because I just don't fucking understand what makes people think this is okay.   I mean, who  the fuck do people think they are? What right do they have to say such terrible things about a stranger, or anyone, for goodness sake? What could possibly make people think and feel like they aren't doing anthing wrong?! The attitudes of people these days, the absolute lack of sense and respect and manners and SHAME just makes me wanna punch a hole in a wall!   Nobody has any remorse for anything they say or do! Dont laugh, redditors, but sometimes i truly feel as if some individuals aren't even people. They are just disgusting filthy slag. They're monsters. Theyre soulless. People will tell this to them at some point in their lives but they won't listen.   Those pathetic sorry creatures will really believe there is nothing wrong with them, nor their actions. They dont have the ability to think of anyone else as a human being, or to have compassion for anyone. They don't have souls. They're a disgusting hollow skin of a person and will never be anything more.   Forgive me for my rant OP, this is something I just feel very strongly about, due to both personal experience, and observations of a person with common sense. OP, I hope you continue to wear your brave girl shirt and feel good about yourself, ALWAYS. Because no matter how you feel about your appearance, no matter what happened in your past, no matter what anyone says about you, you will NEVER be like those girls, YOU have a soul. And you will always be a brave girl.

t5_2rmjc,oSwooD,1379361561,"On September 14th, Morning Musume held their 16th anniversary event 'Watashitachi ga, Ima no Morning Musume desu. 17-nen mo, Saa, Ikouka.' at Bellesalle Shibuya Garden.   This day marked exactly 16 years since the group's name was announced on the broadcast of TV Tokyo's 'ASAYAN' (1997). Leader Michishige Sayumi (24) expressed, ""We were able to safely make 16 years thanks to everyone who always supports us.""   Morning Musume is currently comprised of 10 members: Michishige, Fukumura Mizuki (16), Ikuta Erina (16), Sayashi Riho (15), Suzuki Kanon (15), Iikubo Haruna (18), Ishida Ayumi (16), Sato Masaki (14), Kudo Haruka (13), and Oda Sakura (14).   During the event, Morning Musume performed ""Renai Revolution 21 [Updated]"" with new choreography for the first time. After introducing themselves, they gave the appeal of the new era of Morning Musume by shouting in unison, ""We are Morning Musume!""   Michishige commented, ""I've been a part of Morning Musume for 11 years and have experienced many things. I feel that we are here now because the members of each generation worked hard. I am thankful for the senpais of the successive generations."" Sub-leader Iikubo added, ""We will do our best to entertain those who have loved Morning Musume from before and those who have recently grown to love us.""  There was also a voice message from producer Tsunku♂ announcing that he has added a concert on November 28th at Nippon Budokan to their upcoming tour that starts on the 21st. In tears, Oda said, ""I had a dream that our additional performance was Budokan!"" Michishige set a goal saying, ""We've only performed at Nippon Budokan when someone was graduating. So from now on, we want to do our best to have the tour finale at Nippon Budokan or Yokohama Arena.""",♂

t5_2qhm5,aramid,1379361678,"Do you even know whether you're complaining about TigerDirect or UPS?  And have you ever dealt with UPS packages with residential service?  Whose customer service did you spend an hour on the phone with?  I would assume that once a package has left the warehouse, TigerDirect wouldn't be able to do anything about it, and you'd have to deal with UPS.  Once UPS attempts to deliver the package, they'll leave [a notice](http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/service/infonotice.html) on your door.  This notice gives you the option to change from delivery to pickup.  A couple of key notes from the UPS policies: &gt;If you have received a UPS InfoNotice after one delivery attempt has been made, you can change your delivery options on ups.com  That policy page I linked strongly implies that you don't have very many delivery options until *after* an attempt has been made.  &gt; If an in-person signature is not required, you can sign the UPS InfoNotice, put it back in its original location, and the driver will leave your shipment on the next delivery attempt.  Depending on just how strict TigerDirect's shipping instructions were, you can probably just sign the slip and the package will be redelivered the next day.  &gt;UPS will return to shipper all Ground packages after the final delivery attempt, with the exception of packages where the shipper requested a delivery signature. All Signature Required, Adult Signature Required, Air, UPS 3 Day Select® and International packages will be held for five business days to give the customer time to make arrangements to receive their packages.  Since it's signature required, they won't return it unless you basically just ignore it for the next week.  **TL;DR:** Have patience, and see what happens once they've actually tried to make the delivery.",®

It balances fine without the subscript, and you seem to have used it ok in what follows.)    --  airing. The word you want might be aerating (simple verb aerate).    --  Now to the real question.  Here is how I would approach it... You have some Fe(2+). You convert it to 3+. And you set the pH to 8. Fe(OH)3 precipitates, because Fe(OH)3 is quite insoluble.  I'd take the original amount of Fe2+, which you can calculate, and convert it all to Fe(OH)3.  Fe2+(aq) + O2 and water as needed --&gt; Fe(OH)3 (s)  (We don't need to balance  the rest of it.)  Note that does not use the Ksp. Why? The stuff is insoluble. Everything will precipitate. (But I am suspicious of the book answer. Doesn't seem right.)  If you do want to use Ksp... You have not quite done it right for this case. The pH is specified. The OH is fixed by the pH, and is not 3x. (It would be 3x if you were simply dissolving. But the pH is fixed. use that OH level.)",↔

t5_2vizz,throwawayy5532,1379370413,"&gt; In all our frenzy about Health at Every Size® (HAES) and our desire to negate the stereotypes of the unfit, unhealthy, unattractive, un-everything fatty we forget a key point:  So let me get this straight…you are ditching the only thing about the fat acceptance movement that made a little bit of sense. It was not rocket science but at least it was a positive message to people struggling with food or weight problems. Health at every size meant that people who felt uncomfortable buying healthy food at the grocery store or stepping a foot in a gym could at least have some self-confidence to make positive changes. Great. Brilliant. Continue.   &gt; I’ve swallowed pills and slit my wrists and stared in the mirror for fucking hours hating everything about me.   I had an eating disorder. I was addicted to Xanx. I had a drinking problem. None of that makes me right. I am not giving you oppression points. Nothing you just said makes anything you claim valid. Naming issue after issue does not show how far you have come UNLESS you are satisfied with yourself. You sound hostile, vicious, and bitter.   &gt; to a praiseworthy 300 calories a day.   There is nothing praise worthy about that. That is sick.   &gt; Just a fat stomach with a mouth that consumes, consumes, consumes in a consumerist society and that’s bad, that’s wrong, that’s evil… except when thin people do it.    You are obsessed with thinness. You put it on a pedestal and make it a powerful thing. You called yourself ugly. You beat yourself down. Take some ownership for what you do to yourself and stop blaming society, or Reddit, or people who are against your fatphobia dogma because it is ALWAYS CHANGING! It used to be HAES and now HAES is the enemy. Thinness is the enemy. Are you seeing a pattern here?  &gt; Please, please someone explain to me why a long, miserable life is better than a short, happy one.  Because it is possible and you are quitting. You are tapping out. Call it what it is instead of saying it’s a “lifestyle alternative”.   &gt; I know the argument coming: “But if you’re thin you’ll be happy  Bullshit. You will not be happy if you are thin. You will be happy when you do some introspection, look inside yourself NOT AT YOURSELF and figure out what makes you hate yourself so much. It’s you not thin people. It’s you not the magazines. ITS YOU. OWN IT. TLDR: Take ownership over how unhappy you are and stop blaming everyone else.   ",®

She has no backbone at this point, they're in their 50s and they've been together since they were 16 - yikes (can you imagine marrying your first puppy love? Eep!). Talking to her about divorcing him is like trying to tell a girl in her first break-up that there are other fish in the sea...She really doesn't believe that there is life without him. And she knows he needs her. She will never leave him...she is the one who fights his court battles, fixes his dinner every day, picks his socks off the loot, makes phone calls for him, earns the majority of the money (upper-middle class family), etc.  I wish I could explain why the ""go into a public place and declare a divorce"" strategy doesn't work at all with domestic abusers, but 1) I'm on an iPad 😩 and 2) much smarter people than I have written exhaustively on the subject. It has a lot to do with the incredible amount of control (physical and psychological control) that the abuser holds over the family.  You'd also be surprised at how many people have seen my mother and/or me with black eyes, bruises, etc, and don't do anything. My mom would lie anyway. When I was 19 my dad threw me down he stairs and gave me a concussion. When it didn't ""go away"", she took me to the doctor, but only on the condition that SHE be able to explain that I simply hit my head by my own fault. They had me on lockdown and I of course didn't want to make the situation with my father worse, and I needed medical attention, so I went along with it.  I did try to press charges for a similar incident a few weeks later. They threatened to cut me off from all medical/dental/etc insurance, because its all they could hold over me anymore. They know I have medical problems that need to be treated on a regular basis and that it's not an optional thing...they got real sneaky with the attorney and I was forced to drop the charges. VERY illegal, I know, but as a very scared 19 year old with no resources and burgeoning medical problems, I had no idea what to do other than do what I had to to appease them, as I'd been doing all my life.   What rope forget, I think, is that the abuser holds ALL power. You can't tell them to leave the house. You can't tell them you want a divorce. Statistically, by the way, the most dangerous time for a woman is when she is leaving an abuser. My dad is a sociopath and...scary. He's the kinda guy who ripped my moms tongue out halfway because he said she was a liar. And no, she didn't go to the hospital.

t5_2rmn5,RedLetterDay,1379400815,"Hokey dokey, bro. First things first, congrats on taking the first step and realizing there was a problem!  Now, the hard part is out of the way. Now, you gave a nice little sob story there about moving here when you were 4. Yeah, that’s rough, but if you even remember your home country it’s a miracle. At this point in your life (Your other post said you are 21) you have lived in US your entire life. If you keep blaming your mommy and daddy for moving here, you will never move on.   Your lack of confidence is simply because of you. Sorry. That’s the bad news.  The good news is, if you wish to change it, you can change it. See, I’m a Vonnegut fan, one of his most famous quotes is “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” I love that quote. Now, you probably are decently clever. Probably coasted through high school/college which gave you an over-inflated ego. That should probably stop now.   Let me put it another way. Do you know what confidence really is? It is how you value yourself. If you value yourself like shit, (which you currently do based off your post) you will present yourself like shit. But on the other hand you also have a high sense of self value (not self worth) which results in arrogance. Look up and read the Vonnegut quote again.   Now, the easiest way to combat lack of confidence is getting something material to show your self worth (created by yourself). The second step is taking a breather. Which translates to: hobbies, and time to think. The hobbies part is easy: pick up something which you like. What has been something you have always wanted to do, but never had a chance to start? Something you’ve always given yourself an excuse about. Snowboarding? Photography? Art? Football? Biking? Tomorrow you are going to start doing it. See, I’m a very symbol – minded person, when I had lack of motivation, I would give myself a system. I would give myself a ‘point’ for every day I devoted to one of my hobbies. Each time I didn’t because I decided to slack off, I set myself back to zero. I’m currently at 1232. Fuck the zero. At the end of the day it will help you with everything (including picking up girls).  The breather part is the second hint. Relax man. Your life is in your hands. Not your parents, not your best friend, not your girlfriend, or boyfriend. Yours. You are the captain of your destiny. That’s scary, but if you create a system for yourself, and relax, you’re going to be fine.   Oh and don’t put pussy on the pedestal. If you ever think of yourself as a nice guy ™ again, just stop and re-evaluate your life.  ",™

In all the times I've ever played it the fighting is nearly always focussed on the flags D, E &amp; G (and often F when the Russians are getting raped in their base). A, B &amp; C flags on the US side just seem completely disconnected from the rest of the map with only the occasional scuffle, possibly because they're just too damn difficult to hold being placed in wide open terrain and susceptible to every kind of bombardment, yet and offer no real strategic advantage.  This is just my experience of course but I can't recall it ever being different than the above. I also hated that the US not only have to climb the mountain but they also do it whilst having to look directly into the heart of the Battlefield Supernova™, thereby being placed at a greater disadvantage.",™

t5_2qiel,ThatOneRoadie,1379428407,"Courtesy the [NHL GameCenter Website](http://www.nhl.com/ice/ziplookup.htm):  &gt;Generally, if a game is available for you to view on television in your local viewing area, then it will not be available to watch live in NHL GameCenter LIVE™.  Also note:  &gt;Nationally televised games on CBC, NBC, NBC Sports Network, NHL Network, RDS and TSN are also subject to blackouts in NHL GameCenter LIVE™ as well. In the United States and Canada all Stanley Cup Playoffs and Stanley Cup Final games will be nationally televised.  I recommend Unblock-us to get around blackouts, and/or VLC Streams, if you can't afford heading to the bar, but the streams are fairly bandwidth intensive at higher qualities (not so much data, but a *lot* of DNS lookups, which can lag or delay the stream if your ping blows, like mine does with Comcast, AKA Crapcast).",™

t5_2xn16,casper2002,1379429666,"Hi I want to be project leader.  **The design**  I want use the design king made but with some slight modifications, the standart farm is 16 wide , I want to bring this to 20 wide. The problem in s2 was that people needed to wait long before they could enchant, so I want to change this by making 2 farm areas. You cant have them far away from eachother because if someones afk's at one the other one breaks and stops working. The solution to this is to have them next to eachother so people can use both of them when the other one is afk, but you have to make it so you can switch between 1 and 2 farms . You can do this by making it so you can turn one off and on, this is not possible with king's design tho.So I invented the EnderSplitter™. You need to make 2 farm(10 wide) with 1 block between then you can make a piston that can block and connect them. (come to my plot for demonstration).  **Y U USE KINGS DESIGN????**  Kings design is more efficient then panda's, because the nearest non air block from a spawning space is 3 blocks away with the behemoth and there is only 1 , also the pistons work individually.This is not the case with panda's",™

t5_2qh1i,stln00b,1379432872,"This is just anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt.  When I got divorced, her lawyer came to me and said ""Here's the agreement we're going to present to the judge. We are seeking $1000/mo in support, permanent residence in a state 1000 miles from you, the mother will choose the religion for the children, etc...and you will sign it. If you don't, we're going to seek not only that, but alimony, and that car she bought while you were married? You're going to pay half of the payment. And half of the insurance. We will leave you penniless, because that's how the laws are written here.""  That's obviously the Cliff's Notes version, but that's basically how it shook out. I have a suspicion that my situation was not unique. My ex was legally allowed to take my children away from me, take 25% of my pretax income (which made it impossible for me to see my kids), and basically leave me barely scraping by for years.  There is a *huge* bias in family courts, and feminists denying that they are privileged in that area...the irony is fucking *mind boggling*.  Edit: A few weeks ago there was a misogyny thread in /r/askmen and I replied to one of the comments and someone replied with something to the effect of ""How dare you question her lived experiences!"".

t5_2qh13,not_the_14us,1379451168,"Inasmuch concerns a pattern of steady, dogged determination to incrementally erode the Rights of the citizenry, as established by the Law, you are correct. Yet never before, in known history, has a State found itself so intoxicated with its own power: There are now secret laws that are passed by secret courts to allow illegal secret surveillance of the citizenry. We have a Highly Militarized Police Force™ in nearly ever town across the county. Secret cameras atop nearly every street corner. Incoming implementation of facial recognition software to scan and identify persons in public places. Google is tracking everywhere you go, every one you call, every site you look at, and that's being handed over directly to the NSA. We are holding people without charge in secret prisons where they can be raped and tortured *with no consequence to the perpetrators* because it didn't happen on US Soil. And throughout it all, we have a populace that is so hypnotized by the ~6 companies that control everything they see on TV, hear on the radio, watch at the movies - that they can't even be bothered to contemplate the harsh reality of the situation.  So yeah, while attacks on Freedom are nothing new, they are now directed using cutting edge, world-spanning, technology against the Rights of a populace that is so decadently enamoured by flashing pixels that it can't be bothered to look away - much less actually try to stop it. So then, the question truly becomes: Well, does such a populace even deserve these Rights and Freedoms? The fucking fact is that you don't have to deserve your Rights, but if you fail to protect them against these thousand tiny cuts, you will get what you deserve.",™

t5_2qofe,IMJolt,1379455203,"Jag har väldigt långdragna debatter med mig själv om ämnen som intresserar mig just för tillfället kan vara väldigt blandat. Men återkommande favoriter är väl politik i olika former t.ex. socilism vs kapitalism vs kommunism osv annars brukar det bli om jag håller med/mot eller ser hål i argument på t.ex. dokumentärer jag sett eller texter jag läst. Annat som brukar komma upp är väl religion t.ex. vikten av religion i samhället kontra dom stop klossar det sätter upp för samhällets utvekling. Mera är väl spel design och spel teori, går just nu dataspelutveckling på högskola så det är av väldigt stort intressse. Och väldigt mycket annat men väldigt mycket debatt/diskussion med mig själv. Detta var svårare i mina yngre dagar då jag hade mycket svårare att ändra mina åsikter och hade svårt för att se hål i mina egna argument. Men detta är något som jag med senare år har lärt mig, helt enkelt att vara väldigt självkritisk. En annan viktig grej är även att kunna utmana sig själv, ge sig in på ämnen som man är osäkrare på t.ex. testade att diskutera modes vikt för samhället och dess utvekling för någon dag sedan. Ska även nämnas att debatterna/diskutionerna kan gå mellan engeska och svenska ganska oförutsägbart. Jag är ledsen på förhand för den dåliga stavningen och grammatiken.

It's about playing Borderlands 2 with my best friend, every Wednesday night.  ---  ^(***The following is important to the story:***   *My friend is visually impaired*) ^((*legally*) ^(*blind*)^), ^(*and has extremely thick glasses.*  *He loves video games, although we both admit I do have an edge on him in most competitive games.  This was the first cooperative game we had ever played together.*)  Being the *Responsible Adults™* that we are, Wednesdays are our time to, as he puts it, ""do some killin'"", and a-killin' is what we do.   No one else would be able to play Borderlands 2 with him.  It has to be split-screen, because:   He gets lost easily...   ...shoots things long after they're already dead...   ...and has a tendency to walk too far forward, *spawning more enemies!*  Needless to say, we take things *very slowly.*   I Phaselock, Res, and pop headshots, he Gunzerks, and shoots and shoots and regens ammo, and then shoots some more.   Our two person team has has fairly recently started TVHM (level 42).  On the battlefield, we are one; between killin', I lead, he follows, and we both know it's for the best (he is fully aware of his own limitations).   If give orders, he obeys.    The first time we ran through Bloodshot stronghold, it was a tough fight, and we died...  many, many times.   Sure, we went back for the 1340 and Splinter Group missions, and those *were* easier, but we knew going in that the enemies would be weaker.    I have to say, the single best moment I have experienced in Borderlands 2 is when we reached Bloodshot Stronghold in TVHM.  With all of our stacked skills, and awesome guns, we were a moving wall of death!  *It was sooo satisfying.*   A slagging, corroding, exploding, wall of *pure* ***death!***  Nothing stood a chance...  Mad Mike?  W4R-D3N?  *They were pushovers!*  It was the first time I truly felt like the badass I'm [we're] supposed to be.  Before then, I loved the game, but that was the moment I truly *fell in love* with the game.   I can't wait to do it again, together, once we start UVHM and have even more skills and experience (both in-game, and playing/working together).",™

We don't have a problem with growling anymore.  She still growls a little when she is on the bed and our feet move on the covers.  She really hates that... It's kinda funny how she growls and then stamps off the bed....  We also taught her to differentiate between grumble and speak.  Grumble is kind of like a growl and speak is a bark.

t5_2qh6o,petsnj,1379475700," Looking for a groomer, veterinarian, dog sitter, boarding kennel, dog walker, or a place to buy a puppy? Weâ€™ve got something in store for you! We are Pets New Jersey (NJ)! Weâ€™re bring to feature an interactive website designed specifically to help you find all your pet needs. Whether you have a dog or a cat, weâ€™ll help you find boarding kennels, veterinarians, groomers, dog walkers or that perfect place to find your next puppy companion.  Finding a dog or cat groomer can be difficult. Youâ€™re not sure where to go and your friends have given you suggestions but what if thatâ€™s not the right place for you? Here, its an all inclusive website offering you a chance to speak your mind about groomers youâ€™ve gone to (or boarding kennels, pet stores, licensed kennels, veterinarians, dog sitters, or dog walkers). You can review the places youâ€™ve visited, talk about visiting future places or simply look up places you didnâ€™t know existed. We are from new jersey and understand how sometimes it can be a little hard to find the right place. Being from New Jersey you understand that sometimes having an opinion can be a little outspoken. Well why not help others with that Jersey attitude and speak your mind about what you liked or didnâ€™t like about these places.  The interactive site is going to give you access to information about each individual company. And we hope that you, our dog and/or cat community friends will help us grow into giving other members of our dog and/or cat community friends good information. We are sure that you have gone to groomers where you just did not feel comfortable or did not like the ending result. Why not share that? Or veterinarians you have gone to that just blew your mind because they were honest and explanatory with out all the doctor mumbo jumbo. What about dog sitters that did more then just watch your dog while you were at work but also took him or her to the dog park, maybe got them a bath and went beyond your expectations.  It can be very hard to find the right people to care for your dog or cat. Here we have hopes that you can share your experiences on dog kennels, pet stores, groomers, veterinarians, dog sitters, boarding kennels, dog walkers and what ever else the dog and cat community has to offer. Letâ€™s help each other grow on a whole and point each other in the right direction. You may not have had a good experience in one place but you may have had a great experience in another, where as some one else may have had an excellent experience in the place you though was terrible. After reading their insights you may give them a second try.  We are very excited about our new site and hope you will be just as excited. We hope to provide quality information along with a fun and exciting interactive site. If there is a place you know about and it is not posted on the site, not to worry we can add it for you. Let us help you with choosing the next best groomer, veterinarian, dog walker, dog sitter, boarding kennel, dog kennel, pet store or other cat or dog needs. Letâ€™s form a community to help our furry friends find what suits them!  When finding a groomer, you should be able to trust those who are in care of your personal dog or cat. You need to know that they are in good hands for the few hours they are there. You also need to look at their cuts. Do they know how to do a puppy cut? What if your have a Miniature Schnuazer or West Highland White Terrier and you want them in a cut that is supposed to go with the breed. Let others know if they were able to do that for you. Read about the company and get a deeper look into what they are capable of.  What about finding a Veterinarian? Sometimes that can be so difficult because you really do not know what you are in for. You want a veterinarian that is reasonable priced. We all understand and know that nothing is free. But vets are supposed to be there to take care of the animal, your dog or cat. They are not supposed to try and rip you off every chance they can. A vet that explains what is going on and puts it in lay terms for you and that can be realistic is out there. I may love one vet where as you may not feel the same about that vet. Do we not deserve to share our experiences? You need a vet that can help you understand and explain things in ways that you can understand with out all the big talk.  Finding a dog or cat sitter can be scary or a somewhat challenging idea. We are sure you have heard one story or another about this or that. Share your stories. Connect with real people who have had experiences with these specific people. Compare stories and compare experiences so you get a better feel for what your in for. Share fears and let others help you get over them or relish in them.  Finding the right boarding kennel can be a little tricky. You need to know what you are looking for. What if you have never boarded your dog or cat? How do you know what to look for? Share your fears with others and let them console you. Let them help you understand what boarding your dog or cat is about. You may find that you are looking for a cage free boarding kennel. Or you may find that the boarding kennel fifteen minutes from you offers everything you want or need (or everything your cat or dog needs) and at a reasonable price.  If you are looking to add a family member and just are not sure where to go. Read up on the places that would be closest to you. Read about what that pet store or dog kennel stands for. Read about what the kennel or pet store has to offer. Make an educated decision. If you go to a pet store and do not have a good experience, explain why in a review in order to help others. Your points may miss the mark for some where as you save others from a head ache. If you find the perfect puppy at a dog kennel, tell people. Reviews and your ideology should not always be bad. We have to much negativity in this world. Sometimes if you try and go the opposite route and tell people what you liked you yourself will feel better about your decisions.  We look forward to assisting you in all of your dog or cat needs. We hope that you learn from us and our ideology as well as we can and will learn from you and your ideas.

Please remember to be kind to others who have different views from you because that is what makes us all individuals. The fact that we can coincide with one another even having such drastic ideas.

However, it's pretty expensive and you have to buy a dildo on top of it.  My choice for the time being would be to buy a cheaper one,  see if you enjoy suction cup dildos, then if you do we can invest in a higher quality one later down the line. Also, seems like we're doing a lot of toy shopping :P. Maybe it's like food, not to do it when you're hungry (for cock, sorry had to add that).

I really don't know how to argue that. Maybe this counterexample will help: say I ask you to do my grocery shopping and wash my car. If you do either of those things, it's observable and measurable.

I don't know what epistemology has to say about that, but generally, in science, anecdotal evidence is not regarded as substantial. I, for example, knowing of the fact that [memories are not immutable](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91570-eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-rat/) and other ways our brains can _fail_ on us, often hold back my own conclusions until externally confirmed.

If you do either of those things, it's observable and measurable. (How much does 3 bananas and 2 apples measure? ☺)  That's kinda my point.  Prayer isn't about getting things from the great vending machine in the sky, and so it's hard to measure its effects.  &gt; How is that (empirically) different from meditation without a deity?  I suspect that most theists would say that adds a conversational and relational aspect.  In the same sense that telling someone else about your problems differs from telling yourself about your own problems.  &gt; I would conclude though, that science considers people relying on personal experience to be intellectually lazy.  Here, I would disagree.  I think that science's view on anecdotal evidence is certainly valid when trying to establish a scientific theory or law.  With the question of god, though, we are in a situation where no theory or law can ever be established because limited experience and observations are all we're ever given.  Anecdotal evidence is bad if objective evidence is unobtainable, but if it's not, making the best choice based on anecdotal evidence is all we can do.  The intellectually rigorous theist should recognize that their brain can fail and their experiences can be misleading and so should constantly be seeking to update their beliefs with new information and experiences.  The intellectually rigorous atheist should do the same.",☺

t5_2qh13,trai_dep,1379522403,"You've just described ""capitalism"". Iran took that colored sugar water concentrate then sold it at a substantial markup and profited from it (otherwise, they'd just sell Ayatollah Cola™ (just as sweet, with TWICE the godliness!)). *After* delivering a cut to Coca Cola and Pepsico.  The embargo is broad, concerning buying and selling, concerning commercial deals within Iran (not just certain mullahs connected to their government). Or at least, it did until a waiver was granted due to these multinationals' lobbying the Treasury department.  I donno. I think if we're going to have trade sanctions, we should have them. Or not. But special exclusions shouldn't be carved out so select multinationals can profit, while other companies (or people) are not able to.  I'm not fond of Iran having nuclear capability, and I'm not wild over the idea of starting yet another war in the Middle East, so I trend towards using sanctions and diplomacy to hinder these efforts. So why does Pepsico and Coca Cola get a free pass when others don't? How is *that* fair, or good policy?  And it gets back to the original question. How is leasing office space any less moral than selling sugar water, when trade sanctions are the supposed basis for seizing property based on ""supporting terrorism""?",™

I listened to Rush Limbaugh and watched Pat Robertson and truly believed that they were brave, lone voices of  truth and reason fighting to get ﻿the word out against a maelstrom of liberal lies. I believed there was a massive and insidious left-wing secular humanist conspiracy that touched all levels of government, business, and academia, trying to rewrite society's DNA and make us all godless hedonists suckling on a statist teat.  ...and then I grew up, started to befriend people outside ﻿the tiny bubble I lived in, and I slowly realized that 95% of this stuff was baseless paranoid garbage.  Some folks find comfort in ﻿the likes of Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, in ﻿the notion of an all-out culture war with our nation's very soul the prize, in ﻿the idea that the scary black guy in ﻿the White house is a Muslim communist non-citizen bent on destroying their way of life and is ﻿the Worst President Ever. Are all conservatives like that? Hardly, just as not all liberals are crazed radical neo-hippies who think 9/11 was an inside job perpetrated by GWB, Monsanto and its allies are performing giant science experiments on us with dangerous and freaky GMO foods, and Christians are infiltrating ﻿the schools and government in order to sabotage ﻿the youth.

The Space Shuttle™.  What the wiring offers:  * on-off switching for all pickups, if two pickups are up they go in parallel (*this is stock behavior*) * an all-on combination putting all pickups in parallel (*this is also stock behavior*) * an all-off combination which puts the neck and mid pickup in series while keeping it humbucking (*this, however, isn't*) * a strangle switch for cutting the bass frequencies (*this is stock behavior*) * a pickup-swapping push-pull which can be used to put the middle and bridge into series (*this, again, isn't*) * a bright/deep push-pull which loads the controls with more resistance for an extra deep tone (*and this was just adapted from a Jaguar/Jazzmaster wiring, I calculated how much resistance was needed to turn the ""normal"" Bass VI controls into the Jaguar's ""rhythm-mode"" controls*)  I know, there's no ""all-series"" mode. For that I'd need to reshape the four-switch plate to fit three 4P3T slide-switches, which are longer than the existing DPDT slide-switches. Even then, wiring in series adds up noise instead of averaging it, so I assume having two coils in series (thus humbucking) with an extra coil in series (non-humbucking) would still be a bit noisy. I'm not sure if the Bass VI/Jaguar pickup's claws actually do lower the noise as they were designed to do.  Yes, I plan to do this to my SQ VM BVI. No, not immediately, as I don't have 1M push-pull pots at hand, and I don't know if the switches inside the SQ VM BVI have all six contacts exposed or if some'd been clipped off.

If your getting it from other sources (such as another music app or from a PC) then the data associated with the song needs to have the album art in its reference and needs to be fully synced over.

t5_2r71o,ca2l3vin,1379531930,"Ah I see. Ok so likely then you are probably not familiar with how Windows Phone, Windows Games, Xbox Games, and Windows 8 work when it comes to gaming. (I know its super confusing with how everything is named.)  Windows Phone ONLY plays games made specifically for the platform (.xap files are the format.) and unless your a developer you can only get these games to play buy purchasing them through the Windows Phone Store on your phone or on the PC http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store. Some connect to the Xbox Service for multiplayer or achievements and some don't but they all come from that store  Certified Games for Windows are traditional desktop games and only work on computers that can use .exe files (computers/tablets with full versions of windows on them (normally Windows XP and beyond)). This service/branding is now being discontinued for the Xbox brand.  Xbox Games can be games made only for Xbox or connect to the Xbox service (like some Windows Phone games or Windows 8 games) and are normally found in there respective stores.  Windows 8/RT also have games specifically made for that metro UI start screen and these games may also be Xbox or non-Xbox Games and are normally downloaded directly from the store. Only a full version of Windows 8 (not RT) can also play Certified Games for Windows as it can install and run traditional .exe games in its desktop mode.         Hope this helps you in the future 😉 and I would try and see if you can return the game if you want to try and get your money back.  ",😉

I don't think you can magic them away with ""sufficient"" analysis. The same categories of morphemes used to mark the arguments of clauses like ""she loves him"", ""you hit me"", or ""I moved it"" are used to mark agent-like or patient-like arguments of intransitive verbs.

t5_2tpif,SirMaster,1379544034,"Well, that's actually what I did (blackout cloth).  More specifically painted blackout cloth.  But it requires some work and you will need access to tools and be comfortable using them.  I spent about $120 on my 136"" screen and I think it looks great, so it was pretty good deal.  All the information that I used to make the screen I found here:   http://www.avsforum.com/t/929997/beginners-guide-to-simple-diy-painted-screens  Here is the blackout cloth I used:   http://www.rosebrand.com/product34/Blackout-Lining-IFR.aspx?sid=cohvyt1GtXadTwSl9CprbW5WpFyJfNrUlZxQBoQIVIW4NB1h9NTlXg%3d%3d&amp;cid=174&amp;idx=20&amp;tid=1&amp;info=Masking%2b%2526%2bBlackout  White/White 110"" width.  I went with this because they offer a huge 110"" width which is needed to make larger screens.  A lot of other materials are typically only offered in smaller widths, and of course you can get any length you want.  For paints I did a lot of what that guide says.  I did do the 2-roller technique which worked out well.  I tried different mixtures of white, grey, and polyurethane, but ended up going with pure white paint.  I found with grey I lost too much shadow detail and with even a little bit of polyurethane there was hotspotting.  The paint I ended up with is this:   Behr Premium Plus Ultra™ Exterior Flat #4850  Here is my result:   http://imgur.com/a/xmFbo",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1379548663,"it's time for **RageChat™**  as we all know, trollfun has become something of a poster child for Third-Wave Rage. and with good reason too; his comics have often turned conventional RageComic™ tropes on their heads, highlighted the myriad of problems inherent in the Second Wave and done so in a way that never felt overbearing or preachy.  however, trollfun is not infallible and i think we're starting to see some chinks in the RageArmour™. the fact is, a lot of what we're seeing here is a retread; the gamer gf is a staple at this point, as is the namedropping of extraneous descriptors. gaming PC, iphone 4, what's the difference? there *might* be some significance to the use of 4 and not 5 but it didn't really do anything for me.  the complication in this comic is resolved in an unsatisfying manner. the fact is TF up until now has leaned on his own self-characterisation as a weak, video game-loving nerd who also smokes weed deal with it. now obviously the lack of a True Story face means this is not a true story, however i didn't have to wait until the final panel to confirm that because there's no way the TF i know could take on two guys and win. this comic might possibly indicate a move towards a toughening of TF's character, but if that's the case then *show me the struggle*. don't just go from zero to hero in 10 panels, i can't get on board with that.  in some ways you can draw a lot of parallels between this and TF's [comic concerning homosexual acceptance](http://i.imgur.com/gw3PhWi.png). the idea is to introduce a stereotypical character behaving unreasonably, at which point TF schools them and we bask in his victory. but if you really compare the two, this comic falls short: there's nowhere near the same level of depth to the conversation (the gaming references here have effectively been shoehorned in to give the illusion of depth, whereas the atheism references in the first comic are well-integrated into the narrative) and there's no real escalation of conflict. couple that with the discordant resolution and there's no contest.  let me be clear that i have a lot of respect for TF and the work that he's done to further the medium; RageChat™ owes a lot to him because he's been one of the people really pushing the envelope and giving us something to sink our teeth into. but that doesn't give him carte blanche to phone it in and expect to be met with critical acclaim. this is far from his best work, and the only way i can see that being justified is if this was meant to be the Big Dumb Comic to introduce the Big Dumb TrollFun. which if it was true, just isn't something i'm particularly interested in seeing.  **RageScore™**: 65",™

t5_2qhqb,strolls,1379557353,"I would guess that it might work with the IDscan™ system (as per /u/begsby's [other comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1mnsxq/sober_up_in_drunk_tank_and_pay_400_to_leave/ccb03ch)) because it's developed by a private company with a profit incentive, and because they're bringing it in as legally required via the back door of licensing requirements.  The council has quite a wide range of latitude when it comes to issuing licenses, and they can probably make any requests they like (or any ""reasonable"" ones). They enjoy a cosy relationship with the plod, who also have a deal of input and to whom an identity check like this seems like a gift from the gods of authoritarianism.  If the company developing this IDscan™ system targets landlords then their salesmen must confront the objections of cost - ""my doormen can spot a troublemaker"" and ""I know all the local roughs"". If they pitch their product to councillors and senior police officers then all they have to do is a shiny presentation which shows it solving all problems - the cost is borne by someone else, not those actually imposing IDscan™ as a licensing condition.",™

t5_2yhgk,kiln,1379562660,"I used the ClearBlue Advanced OPK's which are basically the CBFM that you use for a month. I used them the month after my miscarriage and I went straight from O to solid smiley☺/ peak with no blinking. But I wasn't having any EWCM and it was super early for me (CD 10 instead of CD 15). I also tested with the Clearblue Digital OPK's and they were a big O. I had gotten pregnant with the CB Digital OPK's twice before, so I was inclined to trust those more than the Advanced. Anyway, we BD'd incase it was right. But I called the Clearblue Hotline and asked. Turns out that tell you not to use the Advanced OPK's after a pregnancy for 3 months (so after birth, a MC, a D and C, a CP...) because it will not be accurate. Your hormones are all wacky. I continued to use the CB Digital OPK's and got my +solid smiley on CD 15, with tons of EWCM exactly when I was expecting it. And I got my BFP - and with the dating ultrasound, it supports that the 2nd +OPK that I got with the digital was the correct one that knocked me up.  Hope this helps!",☺

t5_2qmjp,Homer_Jr,1379563853,"*Battletech: Domination* is my unofficial/unlicenced, fan-created, deck-building card game for 2 players set in the popular Battletech™ universe that I created and have been working on for over 2 years.  I was originally inspired to create *Battletech: Domination* by Donald X Vaccarino's *Dominion*.  I immediately fell in love with the simple and elegant yet surprisingly complex game mechanics of *Dominion* when I first played it on Christmas 2009, and being a big fan Battletech for over 15 years, I set out to create a game that combined the soul of Dominion with a new combat mechanic and the Battletech theme.  I am new to Reddit and just discovered /r/boardgames, but I have been an active member of the boardgamegeek community for several years so I hope you don't mind me just jumping in here and posting this.  I am very interested in community feedback and any comments are greatly appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this, and I look forward to getting to know and contributing to /r/boardgames!  :)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  **Game Description**  In *Battletech: Domination*, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can ""buy"" as they can afford them. These cards represent military units (BattleMechs, vehicles, and infantry), support cards, and resource cards that the player will use to build an army, develop an economy, and battle his opponent… with the player’s deck as the target of attack! Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to total domination over their opponent. The player with the biggest deck at the end of the game wins!  *Battletech: Domination* is not a customizable card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.  Each game, you select only 12 Supply card types plus the 4 Base cards to include in any given game – thus the cards available to the build your deck are different each game, leading to immense variety and replayability. No two games will be the same!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  **For players already familiar with Dominion**  *Battletech: Domination* has a deck building concept and “ABC” turn mechanic that is very similar to *Dominion*, but introduces several changes that dramatically alter the play of the game:  * New turn phase (Combat phase) and new card type (Unit cards)  * No Victory or Curse cards, no Victory Points  * New victory condition (the player with the most cards in his deck wins)  * Action cards are now called Support cards, Treasure cards are now called Resource cards  * May perform 2 Actions per turn instead of 1, and Actions may be used to deploy Unit cards in addition to playing Support/Action cards  * Trashing is now called Scrapping, and the Trash is now called the Scrapheap  * Limited to two players only (for now...)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The full card set and complete rulebook can be downloaded from my Google Drive:  **Full Card Set v2.2 for DIY printing** (PDF, 4MB): http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93996  **Complete Rulebook** (PDF, 3MB): http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93866  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  *Disclaimer: This is an unofficial, unauthorized, non-profit, fan-made game and is in NO WAY associated with The Topps Company, Inc. or Catalyst Game Labs.

t5_2qh13,Gotebe,1379564202," Emotions are absolutely the first thing that should be considered. The very reason why anyone gets involved is based on them. See nerve gas, and how it's use is not acceptable? The president himself, and everyone else is talking about that day after day. The reason why is international law, but the reason for that law are *emotions* - the notion that we don't want others to suffer it.  So don't tell me that I should take emotions out - you don't get to tell me what I'll do, and you can't make a whole picture of a situation without them either.  Finally, you are maybe tired of arguing, but 5 bucks here says you'll continue 😉. I won't.",😉

t5_2qmjp,Homer_Jr,1379571816,"*Battletech: Domination* is my unofficial/unlicenced, fan-created, deck-building card game for 2 players set in the popular Battletech™ universe that I created and have been working on for over 2 years.  I was originally inspired to create *Battletech: Domination* by Donald X Vaccarino's *Dominion*.  when I first played it on Christmas 2009,I immediately fell in love with the simple and elegant yet surprisingly complex game mechanics of *Dominion*.  I've been a big fan Battletech for over 15 years, so I set out to create a game that combined the soul of Dominion with a new combat mechanic and the Battletech theme.  I am new to Reddit and just discovered /r/boardgames, but I have been an active member of the boardgamegeek community for several years so I hope you don't mind me just jumping in here and posting this.  I am very interested in community feedback and any comments are greatly appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this, and I look forward to getting to know and participating in /r/boardgames!  :)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  **Game Description**  In *Battletech: Domination*, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can ""buy"" as they can afford them. These cards represent military units (BattleMechs, vehicles, and infantry), support cards, and resource cards that the player will use to build an army, develop an economy, and battle his opponent… with the player’s deck as the target of attack! Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to total domination over their opponent. The player with the biggest deck at the end of the game wins!  *Battletech: Domination* is not a customizable card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.  Each game, you select only 12 Supply card types plus the 4 Base cards to include in any given game – thus the cards available to the build your deck are different each game, leading to immense variety and replayability. No two games will be the same!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  **For players already familiar with Dominion**  *Battletech: Domination* has a deck building concept and “ABC” turn mechanic that is very similar to *Dominion*, but introduces several changes that significantly alter the play of the game:  * New turn phase (Combat phase) and new card type (Unit cards)  * No Victory or Curse cards, no Victory Points  * New victory condition (the player with the most cards in his deck wins)  * The player attacks his opponent during the Combat phase and can force him/her to scrap/trash cards from his deck and/or damage/discard Unit cards   * 12 Supply piles instead of 10 Kingdom piles, 5 copies of each card per pile instead of 10  * Action cards are now called Support cards, Treasure cards are now called Resource cards  * May perform 2 Actions per turn instead of 1, and Actions may be used to deploy Unit cards in addition to playing Support/Action cards  * Trashing is now called Scrapping, and the Trash is now called the Scrapheap  * Limited to two players only (for now... 3p and 4p rules are in the works)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The full card set and complete rulebook can be downloaded from my Google Drive:  **Full Card Set v2.2 for DIY printing** (PDF, 10MB): https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1VkMJotxpbPSk5iRkJkME5iZTQ/edit?usp=sharing  **Full Card Set v2.2 jpegs of each card presized for Artscow/PrinterStudio** (.zip, 26MB):  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1VkMJotxpbPOE9rUXdLZzI0dGc/edit  **Complete Rulebook** (PDF, 3MB): https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1VkMJotxpbPMFJQTFlicnI1Nmc/edit?usp=sharing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  *Disclaimer: This is an unofficial, unauthorized, non-profit, fan-made game and is in NO WAY associated with The Topps Company, Inc. or Catalyst Game Labs.

It depends where Microsoft sees it's revenues coming from in the future. We've always known that they would *love* to make Windows subscription-based, and all the noises they're making at the moment would hint towards that. Want to host some email? Use Microsoft's Exchange In Azure™ service. Want to host a website? Use Microsoft's IIS In Azure™ service. Pay per user, per month, all you need is an internet connection!  By getting rid of all the 'third party' elements of the organisation (resellers, third party hosts of their software) they get to eat that market, or at least a good portion of it, and bring it all into their organisation. Of course end-users will still need sysadmins to look after their Azure instances, but mostly that will be workflow adaptation rather than infrastructure work.  The certifications may live on but only as internal training for those working inside Microsoft, because they'll be the ones looking after all those instances in Azure.",™

t5_2qh6c,TheIcelander,1379601535,"&gt;We are not allowed to share our faith with others at work. Christians are often told it is “offensive”.  Your faith - with exceptions that people not versed in theology will not be aware of - says that people who don't believe in it will be tortured for eternity, or at least not allowed into the Best Place Ever™.  That is why sharing your Christian faith is considered offensive. It tacitly asserts that you are better than other people because you believe in the ""right"" religion and aren't like those poor damned souls who are going to be tortured for eternity.  And this is putting aside things like the Religious Right-Wing that exists in many countries, and Christian privilege. The attachment of religion to politics means that when you share your religion without clarifying that you're ""not like one of those nutjobs"" you are also sharing your politics. And religious right-wing politics are equally exclusionary: Anyone who isn't like them is exactly what's wrong with the country.  Religion is like genitalia. Share it with people you love or those who have consented to it. Otherwise, keep it in your pants.",™

t5_2vzvv,SilentProtagonist,1379602020,"The gentleman arrives at the wench's domicile Friday evening, fashionably early, to signal to her that he is willing to sacrifice anything because he has no personality of his own. After waiting for about an hour in his petrochemically powered conveyance (oh how he years to own a hybrid to please mother nature, yet his career at FemCorp does not allow him such an adorably ecological folly, as the gender pay gap at this particular establishment pays men only half a pittance on the dollar a woman receives) he approaches the door and rings the doorbell.   The she-beast, being by nature cruel, callous and scheming, lets him wait, like a predatory creature reveling in the agony it forces upon its prey before extinguishing its life force. After ten minutes she opens the door and welcomes the gentleman with her routinely used charade, all smiles and giggles, hiding her ulterior motives, embracing him and proclaiming the ecstasy of the expected outing. The gentleman suspects nothing.   Meanwhile, the lone alpha dire wolf is probably having sex.   The gentleman, having already fallen for this seductress, is imagining their wedding, their future home and the moment they die of old age, all before arriving at the fanciest upscale restaurant in town, aptly named 'Le Cliché'. The waiter, speaking in a comically thick French accent and sporting a mustache rarely seen outside the world of cartoons asks the whore about their order, knowing full well that the gentleman would not dare to voice so much as a preference, lest he reminds her about his existence. They devour some food, probably oyster or whatever and get ready to leave.   The gentleman, already overcome with lust as his natural urges haven't been satisfied by anyone but himself in several years (clearly the sign of a genetic failure; a life unworthy of life) is now willing to do the she-beast's every bidding. She makes it clear that his presence has become bothersome and tedious and wishes for him to leave so she may deprave herself at one of the local taverns.   The gentleman, despairing, breaks down in tears. Having a faint inkling - but lacking the redpill's thorough understanding, thus being incapable of using this knowledge to his advantage - that modern relationships are barely more than ritualized prostitution opens his wallet. He begs her to take everything - which she does - just so he could worship her for five more minutes.   But having achieved her goal, namely having taken the only thing of worth the gentleman possesses, his money, the succubus departs to visit one of the aforementioned establishments that cater to her primitive whims. She leaves the gentleman sobbing in the gutter whilst contemptuously chuckling to herself. She reminds him however that once she inevitably succumbs to the degradation of aging beyond 30, she shall fling her fattened, wrinkled and evolutionarily useless body into his arms, ready to feign love for his ability to give her money, which she will use to surgically cover up her blemishes and coax slightly more attractive men than him into coitus out of pity.   Once she arrives at the night club, she immediately spots the lone alpha carnivore sitting in a booth at the other end of the room. His massive member already being serviced by three women barely below the age of consent, her vaginal subroutines take over her thinking and she finds herself incredibly attracted to this blatant display of manliness and the seductive allure of his genetic material.   The alpha meanwhile winks at a woman across the dancefloor. Her gaze stiffens, as if she had glanced into the eyes of the Almighty himself and as the alpha slowly raises a finger to point at her, her entire body becomes tense, she blushes and her genital juices begin gushing forth from her unclean chasm. The alpha contentedly smiles to himself.   Our she-beast can now barely contain her attraction. She falls to her knees, rips apart her garments to reveal her not quite spectacular mammary glands and begs for the alpha to grant her his magnificent cock. The alpha, like an emperor on his throne, scoffs at her in disgust at her meager offering. She begins to weep uncontrollably, grovelling at his feet, shouts of 'please' and 'fulfill me, oh exalted one' escaping her tear-stained suckhole.   Meanwhile, the gentleman has masturbated himself to death.   But the alpha is a merciful alpha and agrees to satisfy her, considering it his charitable act for the month. With a steely face he looks down upon her and mutters: ""Back entrance. Now."" Having already orgasmed thrice during this sentence, our slut crawls along behind him to the back door.   Once there, the alpha lifts her up and his glorious phallus slowly enters her oft-frequented crevice. Upon experiencing this sensation time stops for our slut. *Ode to Joy* starts playing in her head, despite male-made culture being incomprehensible to her, as this brief encounter enlightens her for a mere second and she is allowed to see all of creation through the eyes of an alpha.   Having been fucked into oblivion she slides off his cock, falling asleep in the alley. The alpha returns inside to please yet more females. Shortly after, the slut regains consciousness, grabs her Apple™ brand mobile communication device and updates her social networking site's profile:  ""Lol men suck amirite? Also, who wants to fuck and PS: I need money""",™

You can not end violence as long as there is a discrepancy between the producers and appropriators of the surplus of labour, as long as there is class society, as long as there is capitalism.   You can not simply end violence through wishful thinking and liberal pacifist ""enlightenment"", as violence is inherent to the socio-economic reality that humans live in.

The problem is that you have no clue about the material reality of the world and you see private property and class as inherent. You misunderstand what socialists mean when they say ""private property"" and you think that the abolition of it is somehow disadvantaging to you or anyone else because you can not shake off your deterministic capitalist mindset because of cultural hegemony. You are the one propagandized by neoliberalism and you dare to talk about a *propagandist hell of the proletariat*, again showing your complete cluelessness of what the eradication of class really means, and that you equate socialism with images of Chinese people in brown tunics holding red books, because of what your red-scared granddaddy told you.

t5_2qlqh,1waffle1,1379605769,"**ROM Name**: Resurrection Remix®  **ROM Version**:  v4.0.7 [01/09/13]  **Android Version:** 4.2.2  **Download Link:** http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1815285  **Kernel:** Googy-Max Kernel 1.7.2 (NOT default rom kernel)  **General Feedback:** I've been on the hunt for a stable 3-in-one (AOKP/CM/PA) rom for a while now, I was on JellyBam 8.4 for a good 6 months till the CM10.2/4.3 transition which still has too many bugs at this stage. I found Resurrection Remix on xda, tried it and was immediately drawn in by the updated aokp features. After a month of testing I've become happy with it, its my new safety rom. The last [changelog ](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62249445/ResurrectionRemix-changelog.txt)hints at a 4.3 based rom, I can only assume the updates for this has died down a bit, but there really isnt much rom for improvement.   **Hardware Comments:** Unfortunately the stock kernel distorted my sound profiles (Adds a boost by default), which is why i went with the Googy-Max kernel. It gave me the Wolfson Sound Engine which i tweaked via STweaks to fix the sound issue, also gave me a few extra hours of battery. No Battery heating issues, no screen flicker (although there rarely is a pixelation glitch when scrolling, but im not sure this is hardware related because I got it on JellyBam also, very difficult to reproduce the glitch).  **Features:** Out the box you get an AOKP based rom with CM/PA &amp; some original features. It comes with its own stock theme and an alternative but tbh it doesn't appeal to me, I immediately downloaded aother one (Flow). The Settings app has been altered to the dual panel swipable menu, and added rom features are neatly organised into a ""Resurrection Tools"" tab, which you'll find aokp's Rom Control, PA's Halo &amp; Hybrid, then the original features (Im assuming) for: Keyboard, Interface, Sound, Widgets, App Security &amp; Update features.  **Stability &amp; Performance:** Its stable. Even with all the fancy aokp tweaks, its still stable. Performance as well is solid, though you will tend to get lag with some aokp features like the App Window on the navbar (the animation takes 1-2 seconds to react), NavBar widgets are stable but also tend to be a bit sluggish on occasion.  **Caveats &amp; Warnings:** The Rom tends to become unstable when you've reached max cpu &amp; ram, I tend to have many essential apps running in the background and when I don't manually manage/close them, it will eventually lead to a softboot, I let greenify handle it when im not using it. However this could just be the way I use my phone or because I did not install it on a clean recovery (still using the recovery from FoxHound rom a year ago when I first rooted, I'm lazy, sorry), but its something I've learned to live with, because it doesnt happen that often and honestly its pretty much the most stable 3-in-one rom i've come acroos, and acceptable as a daily driver.

It has a certain ironic wit that never allows itself the oxygen to become a sense of humor.  It offers some interesting insights without becoming particularly profound.  I think Cronenberg's larger points about the often murky relationship between perception and reality, between the integrity of the human body and invasive technology, between free will and determinism are muted by his Very Serious™ approach to his subject matter.  Of what value is body integrity in a world without buoyancy of spirit?  What good is free will without spontaneity?  To summarize it in another of my tortured contradictions, the film raises questions of interest to humanity without ever concerning itself with the qualities that make humans of interest.  And as is the habit of many Very Serious™ filmmakers, he doesn't trust the audience to pick up on the brilliant message he's spent the last two hours shouting and decides to spell it all out for us in clear, simple sentences in the last five minutes of the film.  That said, Cronenberg does have some interesting ideas and is an undeniable talented creator of visual imagery.",™

t5_2qn2o,Cornyfleur,1379615379,"Any type can get depression. A couple extraverted women I know suffered post-partum depression which in their particular circumstances suggest that they needed more social contact than what they were getting with their newborn.  The MBTI® Manual (CPP, Inc. 1998) suggests that INFP males reported more difficulty in finding a satisfactory fit for themselves as they grew up.  This was certainly my case.    I found that studying not only the INFP type information but the MBTI (eventually becoming certified) assisted me in understanding not only how my preferences fit with my growing self-understaing of being a slightly depressed optimist (no, not an oxymoron) but also gave me clues about how to change the aspects of my life that conflicted with my predispositions.  I make sure I travel to and from my work by myself, often reading along the way, to regain personal energy. To counter the circumstances of my work that are draining, I made sure my hobbies reinvigorated me, and did not make me more drained.  I keep a personal space at home where others cannot criticize my tastes in art, ideas, or messiness.  That sort of thing.    Good luck, and have fun along the way.",®

It either won't work and he'll get killed in the process, or it will work and have horrible consequences.  The only Republican answer to the Obama enthusiasm of '08 was something approaching similar levels of enthusiasm. The Tea Party was (and feasibly right now, is) the only option for a ""fresh"" new GOP.  No matter what you think of them, these Tea Party candidates will fight against Boehner trying to 'keep them in line'. They could probably win that fight, as well. It's not dumb or cowardly of Boehner to realize that.  But even if they didn't win against him? That means 'the establishment' just put down their newest, freshest players. It won't go over well with the people who voted for The Tea Party™ more than they voted for the GOP. And worse yet, there isn't some new philosophy, movement, or set of candidates to replace them.  The Tea Party was their only real move besides really gutting the GOP and doing heavy renovation, hence sitting out a presidential term or two.

I'm not at all an expert on Lenin — I basically mostly just know that my Russian teacher used to say that I looked like him (I don't, but I don't complain either way). Anyway, I *think* that he was as decent a guy as you could expect from any revolutionary. That is, he had his ideas, he was sincere about them, and was an idealist. But he was also willing to butcher a lot of people to see those ideas put to practice. Again, I'm not really an expert, so I could be very wrong.

I am a student studying a degree in illustration. My dream is to create illustrations for bands, album covers, merch, stuff like that! I'd be very happy if I made that a reality!  I seem to be some weird mix of girly tomboy. Most of my mates are lads, and I have a very laddish sense of humour, and get on very well with guys. I like my big black docs, punk/ska music gigs, etc - but I also like having my hair and nails done, getting all dressed up for a night out, shoes and shopping and anything pink and sparkly!   I have set more things on fire while trying to cook than I'd like to admit. I'm still not sure why I'm allowed to live independently.  I have the worst diet of anyone you're likely to meet. I won't eat most kinds of meat (basically I eat chicken and some beef), I won't eat any vegetables or fruit at all, any fish or any salad. I really wish I could, but I really really hate all of them D:  I once went on such a ridiculous shopping spree one day in town the bank blocked my card because they thought someone had stolen it.  Thanks for the contest!",♥

t5_2vzax,epochwolf,1379627793,"Let's take Panera Bread for example. There's a  right next to the office I work at. It's awesome. Tons of delicious food options. First a little backstory, I'm 5'10"" and 275lbs. After being fat most of my life, I've decided to start restricting myself to the 2,000 calories per day I need instead of the 3,000+ calories I crave. (No FatLogic™ here, I've always known why I'm fat.)  Back to Panera, land of delicious sandwiches, salads, and soups. A full sandwich can be 700+ calories with 150 calories for side of chips (or a hunk of baguette, yes they have apples, I'll get there.). Add a soda and you're up to half of my calorie allotment for the day. That used to be a pretty typical meal for me.   Then I started to realize that I can eat less, still feel satisfied and not feel like I need a nap. I decided to start getting half sandwiches instead of full sandwiches. Half a sandwich and some chips is 500 calories. (Add an unsweetened iced tea to that and I'm one happy wolfy!)  If you get an apple instead of chips and be a little smarter about your sandwich choice (or get a light half salad), you can get that down to 350 calories.  Sorry I got off on a tangent, but this kind of portioning is pretty typical. Now, if I go out for Chinese, I only can eat half of the food and get the other half to take home. Lots of restaurants provide way too much food and plenty of people eat more than they need to because they have been taught to finish their plates.  ",™

t5_2rfz5,LucciDVergo,1379634609,"The only reason I feel it is someone we know is that Blackbeard was the only rookie who became a warlord (possibly but definitely not proven) ever.  This was only due to a honed plan that began with him hiding his strength (no bounty but shanks even had a scar from him).  I don't think an unknown rookie would become one again, plus the new villains in the new world are gonna be world govt, the admirals and the yonkou and their crews.  I feel that just like the old warlords it is a pirate who's made a name and now wants to revel in his glory.  The reason we probably should know him (IMO) is that we've met the supernovas who were the best pirates of the time then (excluding Buggy 👍).  The government wants a warlord to have notoriety before power, aside from Bartolomeo (who I thought might be but like Bellamy (as has been stated) it probably would have been announced) no one could rise that quickly in two years.  If it isn't a White Beard Pirate (which for some reason I have a feeling) it could be a Supernova we haven't seen (the monk perhaps) or maybe a curveball character like Lucci  or Foxy (though I'm not holding my breath on those).",👍

t5_2vizz,Gamiac,1379636120,"&gt;A male fifteen-year-old probably would cry, and a good, realistic game would capture it.

They never show emotion, or care about stuff, because that's for women, and therefore signs of weakness!  ^you ^know, ^because ^women ^are ^inherently ^weak...?  I mean, that's really the problem here. Like, let's look at Japanese media for some examples, since they have a lot of male teenagers who dare to have emotions. You have characters like Cloud, Hope, and Shinji who are popular in the female portions of the fanbase precisely because they're well-developed, realistic characters!  But the male portion? They revile them as pathetic wastes of life because they aren't fucking Rambo! And that's really the core of the issue here. There is a significant portion of people who think that because a male character isn't able to ""man up"", so to speak, he's a shitty character because he simply doesn't live up to their expectations of what a man is *supposed* to be! And because of that, you have thousands of stories where men and women who adhere to masculine virtues are main characters who get shit done, while anyone who doesn't are part of the background when they aren't played as jokes, because to do anything else is seen as bad writing by people who don't like having their expectations challenged.",™

This would be a good question to ask in 6 months or 1 to 3 year's time, when the Coalition have had time to actually do things, and when we've had time to actually see how Coalition policies turn out (eg. does their ""turn back the boats"" policy actually stop the boats or not; does their Direct Action plan actually reduce emissions or not; is the economy ""recovering"" from the devastating *Budget Emergency™* we faced under Labor; is their FTTN NBN plan significantly cheaper/faster to roll out/better than the FTTP plan we are already rolling out and so on...).

From here, I pulsed for another 10 and my bud is keif consistency. I have ONE beef. (other than those derp batteries) it basically shakes all the keif from the bud and cakes it in the corners and around the blade. This isn't a huge issue, because you can scrape it out and remix or vape it on its own😈  overall I spent 10 bucks including shipping and hot it in 3 days. It works, its fast, its pretty silent. shaking while the device is running and upsidown, it grinds finer quicker, than if you just hold it upright.

They are made of two layers of plastic laminated together that are formulated to stand up to the high temperatures of cooking in the microwave, so they will not get soft and flimsy. When pressure builds up in the bags, specially designed vents allow it to escape. Always allow the bag to stand for one minute before handling.

t5_2qhq6,erin_pongracz,1379655339,"Thanks everyone for the support and feedback! It means a lot to us to see so much interest and excitement about our bag design.   Regarding shipping, unfortunately the way Kickstarter is set up, it wasn’t an option for us to provide multiple shipping options for international destinations so we were only, at this time, able to provide free shipping within Canada. As you mention, it is a necessary cost for a small start up such as ours and we can appreciate it may be a deterrent for some – which is unfortunate, as we would have loved to provide free shipping to neighbours to the South ☺   Our hope at this stage is to raise enough funds for our first full production run and then we can revisit our pricing and shipping options for all of our fans!  We certainly aren’t under any illusion that there aren’t other yoga backpack options - or even regular backpacks that can accommodate a yoga mat – and for many, those work just fine. The design for Körút was born of a personal need/want, not loving the design of backpacks that could carry mats and not finding any yoga mat carriers that could accommodate all the stuff we wanted to carry – our hope was to create an option that provided a simple, lifestyle design with the functionality of a yoga backpack.   We’ve spent about a year and a half on design – trying various approaches to attaching the separate sack/yoga mat carrier to the bag (everything from zippers to clips) and ultimately the double d-ring option provided us with the ability to tighten the mat to the bag securely and created a unique aesthetic that we were happy with.    AND - as an added bonus, you can use the sack as a separate yoga mat carrier (when you don’t need a full backpack) using the included shoulder strap :D  Thanks again everyone for your support and kind words! We can’t tell you how much it means to us.   Erin &amp; Shaun Körút Bag Company Vancouver, Canada ",☺

Well we had used patient first because I was an egg donor and we were heading to a hospital about an hour away (we usually stayed in a hotel overnight first, then went to the hospital at the required 530 or 6 am) so after PF we *had* to get going. I offered to have my mom come with me and he wasn't having it.  530 am comes and he can barely our any weight on it (bite us midway up his lengthy calf on the right side.   I knew what it was by the way it had evolved, a few days prior, I was walking up the stairs behind him and saw what looked like a major whitehead *on his calf*..... So being a picker and popper of things, I wanted to touch it, but he merely scratches it and the white disappears...so we think. That whitehead stage was 100% characteristic of the brown recluse bite.    After I'm done having my eggs retrieved, I'm enjoying my quick but lovely dance with propofol and his friend Versed, when my ex snaps me out of it and goes ""please please wake up show them you can walk we NEED to go ger someone to look at my leg, baby I'm so sorry, please, it feels like it's being gnawed off by my own body""  So if course I traded my happy little hour long nap for his emergency and got him back to the family doctor, who looked at it and went ""yep, your girlfriend is correct, it's a brown recluse bite. Probably crawled up the leg of your pants as you were crawling around in the ceiling of the hotel where you work, then felt threatened.""  In the end, doc pulled the gummy necrotic part of his bite out and left a hole about the size of two bic pen ends, and about 1/4"" deep. It moved VERY FAST. It took a looooong time to grow skin over it.  Despite my best efforts till even today, he STILL won't get a brown recluse tattooed next to the prominent scar!

Short of that. FUCK OFF TO YOUR RETIREMENT HOME MR BALLMER. You took that massive, if ill-gotten, lead that Microsoft had and absolutely squandered it which one stupid acquisition after the other.

Medium Remote Repair Augmentor I  Medium Remote Repair Augmentor I  &gt;Dear sir/madame,  &gt;Thank you for your interst in our famous level 4 mission / complex runner, the Lovetar®. The Lovetar® is a fun ship for lovers to explore level 4 missions and each other on an intimate basis.    &gt;Safety first  &gt;Before using the Lovetar®, ask your nearest lvl 4 agent which mission he has available for you and your partner. Every mission can be run with the two of you and most certainly with the Lovetar®. That's because the Lovetar® comes with a small buffer of 7250 armor and a resist module. The maximum resists are 77.5% for EM, 59.5% for Explosive or 85.4% for Thermal damage depending on which damage type you decide to resist against. Its resist against kinetic damage does not need any boosting, it is already a stunning 83.8%! Also remember that if you or your partner has leadership skills the resists on the Lovetar® will even be higher.  &gt;Make sure the two of you are in the same fleet and assign a fleet-, squad-, or wing leader. We know this can pose a problem at first, so our advice is to switch turns after completing a mission. Warp into the mission site while holding hands by using the squad warp button and activate the gate together if there is any.  &gt;Making love  &gt;The 4x Centii A-Type Small Remote Armor Repairers in the high slots are essential for having fun. When active they can give 124.8 love per second, that is the same as 3 Medium T2 armor repairers can repair. But you and your partner have to be intimate to make them work. Get within 6.5km of each other and start gently by locking your lover. If the rats are shooting your partner, start your magic by activating the repairers. If everything goes well between the two of you, your lover will return your call when the rats shoot you. Don't forget to deploy your drones together to shoot the rats while enjoying each others company.  &gt;If the rats are too tough to handle, start spicing things up by orbiting each other. Don't forget, you can move even when webbed. With the tiny signature radius you have, battleships won't hit well and because there is two of you they will switch targets after awhile. If things don't work out, align to a celestial and warp off together. Leave the drones, they are worth less than your Lovetar® and be kind to each other at the station or planet. Things like this can happen and you can always give it another go by swapping some drone damage amplifiers for more hardeners or fitting an afterburner instead of the microwarpdrive.  &gt;If all goes well and all the rats are destroyed, you can inform the mission agent that you are happy lovers and enjoy the pricey loot together.  &gt;Speed and stamina  &gt;With the Lovetar® you can make love forever at 53% stamina with a normal speed of 221m/s. You can even switch out the recharger for another tracking link, but if you do you will run out of stamina after 10 minutes and will be for some time due to the penalty of the mircrowarpdrive. You could change to an afterburner instead, but with the microwarpdrive you can make love at a whooping 1365m/s, which has its advantages. But be careful, fast love will only last 2 and a half minutes and can seriously ruin your evening if you are not experienced enough. You can always improve your love speed or stamina with a Zor® link or remote repair implants, but those can be expensive for a first night.  &gt;The toys  &gt;Harass the rats with an array of drones you can bring with the Lovetar® and try different types on the rats together while making love. Your combined dps at lvl 5 is 1502 with Garde II's, 794 with Hammerhead II's and 516 dps with Hobgoblin II's. You can even use other types of drones if you are up against for example the Sansha. On paper the dps will drop a lot to 1220 with Curator II's, but you will discover that the rats will die faster.  &gt;The Costs  &gt;Have a fun night with the Lovetar® for just under 300 million isk. Costs are a bit higher now due to its success, but the small A-Type remote repairers are still only 8 million isk each and the ship, which had a resent buff, is only 190 million isk.  &gt;Why the Lovetar  &gt;The Lovetar® offers a great way for lovers to get to know each other by being active and intimate at the same time. Missions are exiting and fun to explore with the many possibilities the Lovetar has to offer. You will find that relying on each other for a longer period of time will result in a faster completion of your ultimate mission goals. Once familiar with the Lovetar® you can even boost your love life by running daring complexes together in lowsec or 0.0 for more precious loots. Whatever you do, one thing is for sure, you will definitely not fall asleep with the Lovetar®. Try her now and have fun lovers!  &gt;Kind regards,  &gt;Stacey Starwolf, Disband.  &gt;The Lovetar® is only available trough the Disband. alliance. Copying the Lovetar® fit will result in us letting you walk the Nyan rainbow of love with kitty ears and a fake tail. The Disband. alliance is not responsible for the destruction of the Lovetar®, her drones or break ups between lovers. For more information check our website and forums or contact us in game.   &gt;- Spoilers -  &gt;- Spread your love by repairing the drones of your partner when they are under attack. &gt;- Assign drones to each other or assign them to your partner when you are tired or jammed by jamming rats. &gt;- Use the microwarpdrive and chase each other across the field playfully to get away from the rats and make love from a distance while sniping them down. &gt;- Align towards the gate and fleet warp hand in hand to arrive at the next mission site together.

Im going to find out more about that actually. But the issue is ""serious"" enough, I suppose, that they've developed a jaikbreak tweak to patch it. Now, not everyone is jailbroken, obviously, so the hope is that Apple will respond and work with QuarksLabs to develop a patch or patch it on their own. He was very guarded to say if he thought Apple knew about this method of decryption but my impression was that he felt they didn't know about it… I'm going to try to get some clarity on that point if possible. I think the main thing QuarksLabs is pointing out is that Apple should not have been so quick to say iMessages CAN'T be decrypted. Lol… to be honest the whole research made me feel better about Apple. If they haven't looked at or shared users' iMessage information, then I'd say they are as committed to user security and privacy as they say they are. 😊 ",😊

Little Timmy had dick cancer.  Cancer in his dick.  I couldn't help but feel bad for him - he might have been a bastard child, but no man should have to go through that.  The letter ended with her asking if I could help fund Timmothy's cancer dick surgery.  I was right - the stupid woman wanted money from me.  I'm not falling for this shit again.  ""Todd, can you come into my office?"" The tour manager said, poking his head into the break room.  I crumpled the letter and threw it over my shoulder.    ""Listen Todd, you're a piece of shit and we want you out of this production.""    I found myself on a greyhound bus headed back to Deborah's house, just a few cities over from the one I was currently in.  I walked through her door defeated, luggage in tow.  Deborah was sitting at the table, eating some Rice Crispies™ and drinking a Diet Coke™.  Part of your balanced breakfast.  ""Todd, you came!"" Deborah bellowed, almost on the verge of tears.  ""Anything for family, Deb.  You know I couldn't leave you two shit-fucks to fend for yourself.""  I looked around for Timmy, eager to break his spirits.    ""Where is Timmy?""  I asked  ""He died from the dick cancer this morning.""  Tears were pooling around her tiny little eyes  ""Oh, what a bummer.""  There was an awkward pause for a moment before I had an idea.  ""Want to go to Tijuana?""  ""I thought you'd never ask."" ",™

These people accept the findings of science and are even passionate about scientific discovery. The won't tell you that the Bible is anything but the writings of fallible men who did their best to understand their world and the divine. They don't presume to know anyone's fate or even what set of options exist. Further they understand disbelief and might not believe if it weren't for their own personal experience. They don't pretend to know why they are given some revelation and others aren't. They only use rationality to argue morality, and wouldn't pull an Abraham if asked. They have read their bibles (in different languages) and don't hold that everything in the Bible is divinely inspired or a moral guide.   Granted, most Christians would not recognize them as TrueChristians™, but no one will get every Christian's endorsement? They identify as Christians and that's my standard.

t5_2qnh3,LaurieLoves,1379728505,"I haven't read the other comments but I'll share what I know. If this is repeated information, sorry lol. Warning, WALL of text below!  Try to buy/adopt from a breeder. They're much more socialized and are more healthy as they're not kept in tanks like pet store rats. You CAN successfully get rats from pet shops though. My first 6 were from a pet store and they were all fine. I also like the aspect of saving them from snakes, but it kind of keeps the demand up, so it's your choice :p.  If you decide to get from a pet shop as they're easier to find, get babies. Then you can make sure they're socialized growing up. Make sure you get at least two of the same sex, you don't want a boy and girl obviously they will mate and you'll be overrun lol. They're very social and may become depressed if they're alone. Try to get two that have been living together as you won't have to worry about getting them used to each other.  You want to make sure you have a big enough cage to accommodate their full grown size. They can get pretty big! Please don't use an aquarium tank, even with a cage topper as they need clean air at all times. If you're a smoker, you'll want to keep them in a smoke free area. Don't get any bedding but Carefresh or aspen, aspen being the better choice as far as price. You can buy it in bulk for about $7-$10. Cedar and other kinds have oils that can give them respiratory problems. One important note, you may already expect this as you've had mice, but ratty's only live around 3 years. It can be extremely upsetting to lose them. Not to be depressing, I just wanted to get that part over with lol.  They'll need fresh food and water everyday and their bedding kept clean. I'm sure you know that lol, just throwing it in there. Make sure you clean their water bottle out if the water gets too warm as mold can grow in there. They need toys, nooks, beds, hammocks, whatever toys you want to get them. Just make sure they're ratty safe. Most bird toys are safe. If you want to make them their own toys, use fruit tree wood such as apple. If you bring them rocks (helps keep their nails down) or bring in wood for them to chew, you'll want to bake it for a couple hours at a low heat to kill any parasites or lice. In my opinion, thinking of things for their cage is one of the most fun parts of ratty ownership :)  Once you have your rats:  Once you have them, you may see [red around their nose or eyes](http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S155750630700153X-gr7.jpg). This is not blood lol, it's called porphyrin and it's a natural occurrence with rats. (First time I saw it, I thought something was horribly wrong). Rats carry Mycoplasmia (spell check), it's not contagious or anything. It causes them to be susceptible to respiratory infections and the porphyrin is caused from that. Small amounts are normal and nothing to worry about. However larger amounts accompanied with a lot of sneezing or heavy breathing means they'll need to see a vet. Usually their ""everyday"" vet needs are surprisingly cheap! A checkup for mine where I live is usually less than $10. A vet will usually try an anti-biotic like Baytril to help your ratty get better. You'll want to make sure you find a vet that treats exotics before you get them.  Another common ""problem"" is [bruxing and boggling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJmotYj2cc). One day you'll be petting or loving on them and their eyes will bug out a little and you'll hear a little grinding noise. This also scared the hell out of me before I knew what it was. This is very good! It means they're happy and content :) It's a little weird at first but you'll grow to love it :)  Bathing is really important and a fun way to bond and play, but if you don't know what to do, it can be stressful. You will most likely never need to use soap on your rats, it's great! If they're ever REALLY dirty, use a touch of Dawn dish liquid. Otherwise, All you have to do is fill up your bathtub with a couple inches of warm water and put in your ratties :) They like it if you throw some frozen peas in there as well. Make sure there's no draft as they can catch a cold from it. You can pour a little warm water over them and they will use it to groom themselves. This also helps keeping their coats and tails clean. Nothing worse than a dirty rat tail! Make sure you fill up the tub first as the noise can be alarming to them and make them poop like crazy in their nice clean bath lol. Have a little dixie cup or something handy to get their poo out with because the warm water makes them ""go"". As a fun note, when they're young and not used to baths, they'll try to jump out and it's SO cute!!  It's pretty common for your rats to appear like they're fighting, but not. This is called [""power grooming""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLtPfM3i978) and it's a very normal, social thing they do.---The only time you should worry is if there's excessive screeching or you see blood. (This has NEVER happened to me personally). Generally rats get along very well. If they WERE to ever fight, throw a small towel over one and separate them.   Your rats will lovvvvve treats! It's fine to give them treats, just be conscious about their diet. You don't want them to get too fat :p They love unsalted shelled peanuts, cheerios, yogies (yogurt drops from a pet store), peanut butter, fresh fruits and veggies etc. But only your rat can tell you his favorites! You don't want to give them anything too sugary, salty or obviously bad for you, like bacon or too much cheese. Giving them treats will help you bond and can be used to train them to do lots of [awesome tricks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A07gDVLe14)! Tricks are absolutely optional lol, but they can be a fun way to play if you have the time! One more tip, NEVER feed them treats through their cage bars as this WILL make them bite. I made this mistake with my first two and got bit a lot. If you don't do this, your rat will never ever bite you. Their normal rat food will be available at any pet store, walmart, kmart etc. Ask for help if you don't know what to buy. I wouldn't recommend getting anything with too many pellets as those usually get wasted by mine lol. My babies love the stuff with lots of different things like cereals, corn and dried fruit mixed in. Again, all ratty's will differ though, that's just my experience.   On really cold days, you can heat up a bottle of water and put a sock over it that they can snuggle up to. On warm days, you can do the opposite to cool them off by freezing a bottle and putting it in their house :) You can also give them a heavy bowl of cold water (bottom floor of cage to prevent it falling on them) and add some frozen peas. They'll actually put their little heads in to get the peas! Another one of the mannnnny adorable things rats do!  You can make little toys they'll love very easily. You can take a paper towel or scrunched up piece of paper and put non perishable treats inside and hang up in their cage. It's fun to watch them tear through to the good stuff! I use soda boxes for little hidey houses all the time. Be sure to put in bedding though or they'll walk through their pee and poop and you don't want that. Hard boil an egg and watch the craziness ensue! You can hang up bananas with peanut butter on them, or just give it to them on a plate. Little foil balls, bells, mirrors etc, they love it all. A lot of people put wheels in their cages. Mine don't like them but some do and it's great exercise for them. (not every day though, too much sugar). If you don't smoke in your house, letting them ride around on your shoulders is a lot of fun for them. Be sure to wear a t-shirt lol, their little claws can hurt!.    That's all the first-timer info I can think of right now. Hopefully you'll find this info useful! I just wanted to share with you the things I wish I'd known about before I got mine lol. It all may seem like tons of work, but it's not. It becomes second nature and you find your own ways of doing things along the way, just like any other pet. You will LOVE having rats! They're the most amazing little guys ♥",♥

t5_2qh1i,Revelgoodpeople,1379730799,"[My post from Man Whores and Lady Sluts of Reddit, What is the sleaziest/sluttiest thing you've ever done? (nsfw)  I have one and only one great and horrifying story. About 4 months ago I was at my friends house, We've been friends a decent amount of time probably a year or so. It's about 10 at night, only her and her mother are home. Father works in over night security or something, Idk.  Anyhow after 3 consecutive shots each, my friend and I begin making out, She takes out my dick sucks it, I go down on her and then she gets in the doggy position and we start fucking. At this point we're both fairly twizzled™ I'm fucking her and then I hear the door open behind me, There stands the mother, I freeze up like a deer in head lights and my friend does the same pulling the covers over her. The mother walks over and gives me 2 options.  I can leave and she'll tell her husband. (Daddy is not only a gun enthusiast, but loves his daughter to death). She's going to join us and she won't say a word. I look at my friend and she decides for me and starts sucking my dick again with the mother undressing in front of me then joins her daughter on the bed swapping spit and sucking my dick. At this point I'm 2 things, 1 - Fearing for my life, and 2 - the most horny I've ever been. So Now I have them both right in front of me on the bed in doggy position, of course I plunge into mama first. I want to please her so I can escape with my life so I'm fucking the shit out of her while I finger the daughter next to her, a good 15 minutes of continuous rock hard effort later, the mother squirts like she hasn't had an orgasm in 20 years. My entire crotch and front of my legs are now dripping, I pull out and think alright, I paid my dues.  (Wrong) She demands I fuck her daughter while she watches. So I start fucking the daughter again. Mid hump I two hands on my ass and i feel my cheeks being spread apart. I'm panicking a little, but it's soon soothed as she begins to lick my ass. Shortly after the daughter cums, I pull my dick out the mother starts sucking me till I cum. Afterward She throws me my pants and tells me to get out asap. I manage to put my boxers on and run out with my shirt / pants in my hand. TL;DR Life or death mother daughter pussy.  I can't stress enough how real this actually was, and how much I wish I could have enjoyed it. ",™

Perhaps I will get more than a stock email reply from him, or his boss, on paper.)  Propylene glycol is the stuff you call ""antifreeze"", it's used in both my e-cig and the asthma inhaler I used to need when I smoked.  Should I worry that my inhaler was keeping me warm as well?  Next time you decide to insult something that is saving lives, please do your research first, I have lost several family members to lung cancer, and I wonder why you felt motivated to attack something that has helped myself and many others, stop smoking.  In the spirit of education, I am adding in at the end of this email, a large array of scientific, peer-reviewed studies showing that e-cigarettes lack all the dangerous components of tobacco smoking.  The simple fact is that these are a life-saver for many people, since they mimic the oral fixation and sensations of smoking, without any of the harmful ingredients usually found in cigarette smoke or tobacco.  The common ingredients in the e-cigarette are: vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol (what you so ignorantly refer to as ""antifreeze""- it's actually used in medical applications like inhalers and nebulizers, and in hospital respirators), flavoring, and nicotine. (Although some people use no nicotine in their e-cigarette.) I find myself wondering if people who mock this item in the media, will be willing to cover my healthcare expenses in twenty years, if I go back to smoking?

t5_2qh3l,spazmodic-,1379747645,"Hmm yes, yes... that's a good story...  &gt; Life of Pi II: *Pizza Pi*  no no, doesn't have enough punch...  &gt; Life of Pi II: *Pizza Pi* **with a vengeance**  Perfect!   And I like the 'sending pics of tigers to NSA' thing, but we've already got the above... so *spinoff?* I'm thinking spinoff. Romantic action drama comedies are hot right now. Here's what I'm thinking:  Elizabeth always figured she would be alone in life, with her work schedule at the NSA. One day some unsuspecting internettors sent pics of a tiger to random addressees at the NSA, one of them being Elizabeth. Being in the NSA means letters get opened to make sure nothing out-of-line is happening. The mail reviewer opens up this package and finds barely-suggestive pictures of a tiger inside... *tiger love is forbidden for NSA agents*. Elizabeth realises what has happened and goes on the run, embarking on a journey to find the tiger and somehow redeem herself. She sets out, armed with only her very particular set of skills and a single photo of the tiger... a photo with *'Richard Parker ♥'* scrawled along the bottom. She sets out on the trail of the bengal, a journey filled with ample murderings and things exploding that shouldn't be exploding, finally ending up finding Richard. At that moment, she realises that this whole time she found out who she really was, and it's not an NSA agent. In making Richard Parker the object of her fixation for so long, so intent on finding him, she felt complete; she realised he was what she was missing this whole time. Richard Parker was a big ol' kitty and she was just a big ol' crazy cat lady. And they lived happily ever after where Elizabeth would avoid leaving the house, but she'd yell at people as they walked by, living happily ever after as a crazy cat lady who hated everyone. Except cats. Also the NSA was cool with her just murdering all those people blowing up all that stuff that shouldn't have exploded so long as she learned a valuable lesson.  What do we call it? The Richard Parker Identity? Catformers?",♥

t5_2qh3p,throwaway71113,1379752131,"I second this. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common reason for fishy or foul smell. In most cases Gardnerella vaginalis is responsible, and this bacillus will not react to any alternative treatment whatsoever. Though there still will be lots of lactobacilli in the dysbiotic flora, Gardnerella strongly reduces or extinguishes the special Lactobacilli which produce H2O2. So after antibiotics you still have like none of those bacilli down there that will keep you healthy. As H2O2 is the only thing that prevents the vagina from being hijacked by Gardnerella, there is often a relaps (in 50%) if these infections are cured only with antibiotics.  Bacterial vaginosis can be cured by antibiotics plus Doderlein bacilli (vaginal lactobacilli producing H2O2) applied to the vagina (not orally) after the antibiotics. If there is no treatment after the antibiotics 50% of women have a relaps. The german medicaments Döderlein Med® and Gynoflor® contain only H2O2 producing Lactobacilli, try to get hands on these if you are prescribed antibiotics again. I have not found any american medicament containing especially these lactobacilli, maybe you are more lucky. Do not replace them with other lactobacilli, that may be useless. Because it normally takes 2-8 days, until the pH values normalize, during the first days you might combine this with local applications of lactic acid, H2O2 or ascorbic acid in appropiate (i.e. small) dosage (e.g. lactic acid in the morning, and Lactobacillus preparation in the evening) to make a nice pH value and help your new bacilli to feel at home.   If your boyfriend tells you your vagina smells fresh though, chances are your vagina smells normal - which is still strongly different from what we normally consider as fresh.   In any case, go and see a gynecologist for an exact diagnosis.  I had very bad smelling bacterial vaginosis, and it took me years to find a gynecologist who diagnosed this. The others never took care of it although it smelled very bad and they must have noticed. My SO and I both had to take antibiotics for 8 days and I had to apply Doderlein Med capsules afterwards. Worked wonders, no relapse (that was a few years ago). ",®

Honestly, anything over 10 is bad, even 10 is pushing it so I don't get through my backlog and have a hard time finding time to actually write blog posts. This season, especially when I tried (and failed) to catch up on ~66 episodes mid-season ([covered here](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2013/08/11/project-madness-summer-2013-mid-season-preparation-week-journal/)) really did burn me out.  I can keep up with 13 shows, and actually follow discussion/write about most of them, but it leaves little time for other things, in case you wonder, my Gatchaman CROWDS watch+note taking takes 60-90 minutes, and I probably spend another 1-2 hours reading and engaging in the episode discussion of it.  If I just watch the episode and avoid prolific note-taking or engaging in discussion, then I cut down the time majorly, and leave time for me to write other things.  My work/school load should be more forgiving this year, but this season anime had taken up a lot of my gaming time as well, so I'm not looking for a repeat performance. I might have a couple of shows that I mark under - ""Going to watch, muse on my own time, and avoid spending more than 20 minutes in the discussion threads of it."" - not because it doesn't interest me, but because I have other things that interest me as well.  ----  As for my taste, if you check my MAL it seems like a really weird taste, but just yesterday I opined that the best way to treat my taste is not as one cohesive taste, but as several disparate tastes which reside in one person.",™
t5_2s7tt,thecraww,1379757859,"&gt;There's a reason why Wikipedia is not accepted by all accredited universities as a plausible source. Dictionary.com IS a plausible source.  &gt;So no, it's not because he liked the site more, it's because the site actually has a HUGE backing of facts, and it isn't peer-edited.  Nah, I know my sentence structure could be taken either way but I was talking about them liking the definition more, not the site. That's kind of the inherent issue in this matter because definitions change, unlike facts. People defend the definitions they like, and in an emotionally charged context like this where you have people not wanting to be defined by a word that insinuates fear or etc., things become very muddied regardless of what your favorite dictionary tells you. People are saying the same word and meaning different things, and I can't brush that aside because that's how language evolves.  &gt; Thus, Wikipedia is wrong. Not all the time, but in this situation, yes. It was edited to change the definition by someone who obviously leans more toward the support of homosexuality.  Should we both google our favorite definition of ""wrong"" to bring to the table too? Because I feel like Wikipedia might have a better handle on the popular definition of homophobia (the definition that's going to be encountered most out there where people say things) by virtue of the way it promotes collaborative efforts to come to an often-compromised agreement on popular topics. This is my belief regardless of its practical applications in a university setting. I don't believe that has much to do with what we're discussing because definitions aren't nearly as set in stone as facts are.  Dictionary.com cites this dictionary for the definition in question:   ""Dictionary.com Unabridged Based on the Random House Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2013.""  So I don't know. I guess I could go find the random house dictionary and try to find whatever dictionary it's citing so I can see if that one cites something other than an older dictionary, but I kind of think large-scale collaborative peer-editing is a more elegant solution if we're looking for what will be most ""assumed"" from the word in real world situations. Dictionaries are a good baseline but in special cases like this, they might not be as reflective of the way the words are actually being used by most people. I'm not saying wikipedia is necessarily a great metric for such things either, but the page is undoubtedly popular, and there are undoubtedly a variety of viewpoints that have shaped it over time and will continue to shape it into the future. That seems to me a much more direct connection to the fluctuating cultural forces that are actually working to shape and change these definitions.  You can argue that it's a biased definition, but calling it wrong just because it isn't the same as a dictionary (though as I pointed out, the two definitions are pretty similar anyway once you extrapolate vague terminology in the smaller one) seems pretty absurd given the way language tends to drift over time.",©

t5_2qhzx,centaurskull17,1379775817,"    ""Why are some Hell-bent on Intelligent Design? Why are some Hell-bent on Intelligent Design? Yesterday, I attended, and gave testimony at the Texas State Board of Education meeting.  The issue in front of them was whether to accept textbooks provided by the textbook publishers as they have presented them, or whether they should require that they alter them according to comments made by reviewers.       Of course, this being Texas, many of the reviewers’ comments were aimed at areas where they were simply not subject area experts, and proposed to “teach the controversy.”  You know.  The old “evolution vs. intelligent design” junk.  The problem is, within any scientific body of merit, evolution is not under controversy.  Certainly the methods by which evolution manifests can be; but to say that evolution isn’t real is to be blind to the mountains of evidence that support the theory; while “intelligent design,” or “creationism” isn’t supported by any scientific evidence at all.  Maybe there’s a philosophical argument that God works though evolution; but I am not prepared to say definitively what, if anything, God decided to do with His infinite free time.  I suspect He watches a lot of Reality TV – minus the TV.  There were amazing speakers there, from microbiologists to accomplished lawyers – I felt intellectually outmatched and the sophistication of the arguments (at least the ones on the side of science) made my little prepared testimony seem weak in comparison.  But I left the meeting feeling that nothing was accomplished.  I don’t believe anyone exited that room with an opinion that was different than the one they came in with.  Let’s be frank for a second: Faith is a powerful motivator.  It is very hard to convince someone that they’re wrong on the facts when they believe it is a moral duty to insist their side is right.  Because to a believer, faith is a virtue.  Indeed, the highest virtue.  And evolution may not challenge God’s throne, but it challenges a highly held belief that God created man as the apex of life on Earth.  To suggest that man holds no special place amongst the beasts – that our rationality was not the spark of divine creation but the machinations of blind terrestrial navigation belies the idea that God places us first among all his creations.  And it humbles us. It humbles us because there is no guarantee that mankind will or can remain the apex of God’s creation, and that should we falter and face ecological or nuclear Armageddon, He may save our souls, but not our species.  Some people, quite frankly, can’t handle that.  The argument has been made that evolution is in contrast to faith.  This is not true.  But what is true is that evolution tests faith.  The fact of evolution is incontrovertible and supported by mounds of empirical evidence.  Faith, on the other hand, is fragile.  It is supported only by the strength of human will.  And this is where it gets tricky. Because to many believers, faith, not works, is the only guarantee that one can pass God’s litmus test and gain access to His divine kingdom.  To lose one’s faith is to literally damn oneself.  So tests to that faith must be avoided at all costs.  Better to be a philosophical coward than a theological failure. I have always known that no sane, benevolent God would create a cosmos where faith was an absolute requirement for salvation, yet also create a universe for his creations where that faith was constantly challenged. Such a god would be cruel; and by no means worthy of the title of God.I do not hold to that.  Instead, consider the possibility God wants us to grow.  He wants to push us towards greater understanding.  And the only way we’re going to learn is if He lets us figure it out for ourselves.  There may be blind turns, dead ends, and mistakes.  There may be long strides forward, followed by heartbreaking setbacks.  But such a God would want us to ask Him questions.  And the way to do that is to seek the answers to those questions in His creation.  Every time we turn away from the question, every time we remain purposefully blind to the contradiction, every time we patch holes in our ignorance with “God did it,” without following up with the question “How did God do it?” is a far more disappointing result to Him than blindly holding faith.  We learn through our successes, and we learn through failure.  And no God worth the name would punish a man or woman who tried to hold faith and failed.  I seem to have digressed  – back to the point at hand.  From a practical matter, I think the SBOE meeting was a bit of a waste – I doubt that anyone was swayed by the arguments – that those members who knew of the importance of science in science instruction were emboldened knowing that the majority of people out there who cared about the issue supported them; but that the members who did not felt pride in taking on such a large opposition.  That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have gone en mass, and shouldn’t have spoken, but that is politics; individuals rationally act in collectively irrational ways.  The only thing that I could try to do to change the status quo there was to try to convince those members whose faith was strong that there was an argument based in faith that they had not considered.  And so I delivered this testimony.  Written Testimony authored by Brian Boyko  State Board of Education Committee of the Full Board Public Hearing – Instructional Materials September 17, 2013  Subject: Instructional Materials.  I’m a geek; and as such, you can probably guess how I feel about religion and science.  These are two different fields of study; the Bible cannot teach you how the universe works, and Science cannot tell you what constitutes a life well lived.  But all of you know this.  I could make the scientific argument, of course, but I think some of you may be unconvinced by it.  Instead, I’d like to make the theological argument against merging science and religion.  I’m sure most of you are familiar with St. Thomas Aquinas, the author of the Summa Theologica.  I really like Aquinas; he applied Socratic thought and reason to the study of theology.  He lived in the 13th century but had a mind ahead of his time. Aquinas famously said that “reason in man is rather like God in the world.”  I can get behind the sentiment.  St. Aquinas made arguments founded in reason, not faith, when seeking to understand the Divine, and published them in the masterwork that is the Summa Theologica.  There’s one point he made in that work that applies to the topic today, and that is that Theology is the most speculative of all philosophy.  Its source is Divine knowledge, and because of the greater worth of its subject matter, the sublimity of it transcends human reason.  Transcends Human Reason.  Aquinas also said that “wonder is the desire of knowledge” – and both Science and Philosophy seek to fulfill that desire.  But Science has a limit – science is limited only to human Reason.  Anything that transcends human reason, therefore, cannot be science.  And to attempt to force the Divine – which transcends reason – into the small confines of reason alone, not only makes a general mess of Science, but also diminishes the Divine.  To lower the supernal to the study of the terrestrial is, well, blasphemous.  The Bible has a place in schools; that place is in literature and philosophy.  But not science.  I leave you with this final thought: “We must love them both, those whose opinions we share and those whose opinions we reject, for both have labored in the search for truth, and both have helped us in finding it.”  You can probably guess who said that.  I don’t know if it did any good.  I do know this: sometimes, you have to try anyway.   © 2013 Brian Boyko ",©

So paraphrasing myself...  Having now listened to both recordings, I have no idea who's ""right"", and I suspect that The Truth™ is ultimately unknowable to me.  The irony, I think, is that you've both ended up in the same place. You each got something important from your time together, but at the same time you are now both much more clear-eyed rather than naïve—and about *yourselves*, too, not just about others.  I've made the following comment before elsewhere, but I think that online, you frequently get to know someone ""backwards"". For example, say you encounter someone on /r/gonewildaudio or /r/dirtypenpals, for example. You *begin* by learning about someone's sexual fantasies, possibly including recordings and/or pictures of them, often explicit ones. Then maybe you PM each other, and you start to learn that you have things in common other than an appreciation for online erotica. Often, the *last* thing you learn is that person's name in real-life!  I think this is novel relative to how our brains *anticipate* that relationships progress. If you've already shared intimate details with someone, whether sexual or otherwise private, then it's easy for you to feel (sometimes subconsciously) *like you're already in a relationship*. Even if you're separated by several time zones and thousands of miles.  So this accelerated intimacy can be disorienting. This isn't to dismiss relationships that begin online as inferior, of course, but it is worth pacing yourself because your brain can reverse-engineer its perception of intimacy into an idealized relationship.  This isn't to lecture you, you understand! But perhaps this can partially explain how things got ""intense"" so quickly for both of you, even via online-only communications.  Anyway, best wishes to you both!",™

How many parents would follow through with that command? I would say probably not very many. Most would reach the conclusion that God and morality might exist independently of one another, and then draw the conclusion that it is possible for God to make immoral commands.   ",™

t5_2wo26,Plowbeast,1379780869,"I did point out 2 posts up that calling it a human rights charter is close to bad history and that the issue is debated thoroughly by scholars with a *reasonable* consensus that is it not.  However, if we employ the rule of contemporary standards, Cyrus' treatment of the conquered was certainly better than that of the Assyrians who forcibly emigrated peoples away from their homelands.  The Persians had a much larger numerical superiority and preferred to have subject peoples serve as the hand of the Empire in the countryside; take Asia Minor, where the satrap's forces and official reach was confined to the urban center and the roads.  I am aware that the Persians were not truly tolerant as they forcibly drafted people from around the empire for wars, as recorded by the massive multicultural army of doom™ that Darius sent against the Greeks.  However, the Persians and specifically, Cyrus' tolerance of religious and cultural autonomy is certainly distinct from that of the Assyrians and obviously the neo-Babylonians.  With that said, the Cylinder isn't a human rights charter except in a very narrow definition of the word - it didn't establish a baseline of human rights to be respected *after* Cyrus' death that succeeding emperors were beholden to respect or enforce.  (It's arguable the Romans did codify some measure of this.)",™

Due to this, unless a Pokémon was a member of an all-female species, such as Nidoran♀ and Smoochum, it could never have a maximized Attack stat, as female Pokémon were given the lower half of the IV range. This also caused the inability for a female Pokémon of a species with a gender ratio of seven males to one female—like the starter Pokémon and Eevee—to be Shiny, due to that also running partly off of the Attack IV. In Generation III this was addressed, with IVs no longer determining either of these, allowing for Pokémon species with two genders to have females with maximized Attack and simultaneously retain its chances of being Shiny.",♀

t5_2vkaw,Baxaxaxa,1379816020,"These reconciliation threads are pathetic. I have no patience for dishonest doublespeaking reactionaries and I want nothing to do with your ideology. The fact that it is always the capitalists who make these threads is very telling that they know that they are the ones who argue from shaky ground. If you were honest and not looking for a way to be edgy and posture while further Americanizing/Orwellianizing political theory and language you would not call yourself an anarchist.   I do not expect the general ancap to have any clue or analysis of the capitalist structure, which is why it may seem easy to agree on surface issues such as cops or states while being clueless of the fact that it is the economic structure of society that begets them. It is easy to see states for what they are, but it is harder to recognize the extent to which the cultural hegemon has managed to take root in our perception of what is reality and what is construct. Capitalism is the prime offender and main target.  Right-wing anarchists do not exist.  Edit: To be clear: I am not against ancapism per se, as in, if I have to put my ideas about the feasibility of stateless capitalism or capitalist ideology aside, I'm not against people voluntarily™ starting some ancap community somewhere. I just do not wish for impressionable kids to be lured into supporting capitalism because they think this is what anarchism really means, and this is exactly what the anarcho-capitalist movement is doing and you know it, and it is really, really vile. I know how easy it is to fall for rudimentary soundbite ideals such as liberty and self-ownership or the idea that states aren't legitimate or even real as I have held these feelings long before I became an anarchist and as long as I can remember. ""Anarcho""-capitalism caters to this youthful idealism.  What I want is for political discourse to be clear, that is all. We all know that when language gets corrupted it corrupts consciousness with it. Of course, demanding the enemy changes its name is futile, and from the fact that capitalists insist on calling themselves anarchists still I will conclude that you know you are the enemy.",™

I'd say buffer overflow though, in these cases the basic principle was that some process would constantly write in the RAM (as it was expected to) but never delete or rewrite over his own stuff as it should, eventually exceeding its memory allocation, and more often than not causing a crash.  Edit : I may make it sound like this stuff happen all the time, which is absolutely not the case. But it is a 0.01% risk with potentially terrible consequences and very limited benefits (from the editor's POV).  Yes, I have already seen a relatively big release that had to be postponed to after Christmas because of a missing uppercase character in ""Memory Card™"".

t5_2s4k5,SaneBRZ,1379834572,"&gt; The Toshiba Direct website says the sale ends 2013-09-23 -- it's unclear to me whether that means upon the start of that date or at its end.  The sale ends on September 23th, but there will probably a new one after that.  &gt; Keyboard and trackpad quality/comfort  It's a full sized chiclet style keyboard. There are some reviews out there of the touchscreen version which has the same keyboard. They say it's okay.  &gt; Screen quality of the 15.6"" FHD TruBrite® LED Backlit Display (1920 x 1080)  It's a full HD panel, but not an IPS display. Contrast values are okay, but black levels aren't as good and it's only a 150 nit display. With the glossy finish you shouldn't have any light sources behind you to reduce reflections on the dislpay.  &gt; Linux compatibility (I would pay $20 for the Centrino upgrade. I also wonder about Linux's behavior with the option Seagate 1 TB / 8 GB hybrid drive, including in a dual-boot Windows/Linux configuration -- need Windows for Adobe and IE testing and ""corporate"" website cr-p.)  Shouldn't be a problem at all. Windows and Ubuntu can use caching technology.  &gt; Overall quality. I'm not expecting old school ThinkPad durability, but are these Toshibas ok?  Build quality seems to be okay. Brushed aluminium case, edge to edge display and a sturdy construction. As you said you won't get ThinkPad T-Series quality, but it's okay for the price you're going to pay.  &gt; Is Toshiba Direct ok to deal with, for someone in the U.S.? (I recall reading horror stories about ordering directly from Lenovo, for example.)  You will find horror stories from every retailer on the net. Generally speaking there shouldn't be problem with ordering from Toshiba.  &gt; If budget were not a concern, I'd probably be looking at a Lenovo. However, it really is, right now. Is Toshiba ""good enough""? Is this as good a deal as it looks to me to be?  For 750 bucks it's a decent deal. In the 700 dollar range you won't get something better than an Intel i5 and a Nvidia GT740M. The only disadvantage is that Toshiba tends to install a crap load of junkware on the laptop, which slows it down. Just uninstall everything you don't need after the first boot or do a clean install of Windows if possible.",®

t5_2tx47,flyingfresian,1379838038,"I'm interested to know why your doctor thought that going cold turkey wasn't an option, it seems to me that being cigarette-free *has* to be better than smoking!  I quit quite a few years ago, I forget how many.  I had tried patches a few times but they didn't work for me and finally I was just too annoyed with how much money it was costing me to be a smoker so I set a date, smoked all my cigarettes the night before and went cold turkey on the Monday morning.  I'm not going to lie - **it was no fun at all**.  I was shaky, I was incredibly irritable and kept crying, but the first day went past and then the second.  After a few days, all the nicotine was out of my body and the cravings were reduced.  The cravings I did have were psychological and were just for something to do with my hands.  I chewed a lot of regular gum.  It's been a long time since I smoked now and I wouldn't start again.  For one thing, if I started smoking again I don't think I could go through cold turkey again and so I just wouldn't quit!  My boyfriend is using e-cigarettes at the moment and he hasn't had a ""proper"" cigarette since January, so they do work in terms of stopping smoking.  I don't see any sign of his addiction loosening though, he's just replaced it for another one that smells better.  Good luck quitting, you will feel so much better for it! ♥",♥

What are you hiding? If you aren't doing anything wrong, you shouldn't have a problem.  Like this Lady.  Rochester Woman Arrested After Videotaping Police From Her Own Front Yard  NEW YORK -- In May, the Rochester Police Department arrested a woman on a charge of obstructing governmental administration after she videotaped several officers' search of a man's car. The charge is a criminal misdemeanor.  The only problem? Videotaping a police officer in public view is perfectly legal in New York state -- and the woman was in her own front yard. The arrest report of the incident also contains an apparent discrepancy from what is seen in the woman's own video.  That video, uploaded to the Internet this week, more than a month after Emily Good's May 12 arrest, begins by showing a black male being questioned by a police officer at about 10 p.m. The red and blue flashes of a police cruiser illuminate the scene on Aldine Street.  ""I just got out of the house, man, I'm sick, man,"" the man who has been pulled over says. Other police officers search his car.  Then one of the officers, identified as Mario Masic in the arrest report, turns to the camera and asks, ""You guys need something?""  ""I'm just -- this is my front yard -- I'm just recording what you're doing. It's my right,"" Good replies.  ""Actually, not from the sidewalk,"" the officer replies, incorrect about the legality of Good's actions.  ""This is my yard,"" Good says.  ""I don't feel safe with you standing behind me so I'm going to ask you go into your house, you understand?"" Masic says.  From there, the conversation escalates into a confrontation, with Masic alleging that Good is threatening his safety, and that she expressed other, unspecified anti-police statements before the videotaping began.",®

t5_2sokd,clarinet_carrot,1379867220,"There are a few different methods. In the past all people had to go on was appearance. But nowadays there is dna analysis, which has caused the classifications of some species to be moved around a bit, with some still uncertain!  dna is a bit like an instruction manual found in each cell, and mistakes (mutations) added up over generations is what causes species to change and devolve (split up). Species with more dna the same are closer related.  so humans have about 40% dna in common with cucumbers and 90%➕ with apes, and i think its about 99.5% with other humans. however, this method is costly and expensive.  dna codes for proteins. Proteins are big molecules formed by a long string of smaller molecules joined together. Changes in dna van cause changes in the protein a gene (section of dna) code for. So haemoglobin in humans, whilst still being the same molecule, is slightly different in different animals, more so the less related a species is with us. Scientists can use the sequence of the smaller molecules making up proteins in a similar way to dna to give an idea of how related species are. however, the immune system also uses proteins. An example is antigens (a protein) attaching themselves to bacteria and preventing them from causing further harm (variety of way, not getting into it here.) the closer related species are, the more similar their immune systems are, and antigens are more likely to clump with offending protein. This is something you can see in a test tube. Can't remember exact details, but i think it goes, mix antigens of a species with protein it attatches to, then compare with other species with same protein, and compare the amount of solid clump in the test tube. This method is obviously much cheaper than using big expensive machines to sequence dna, but has other limitations like precision. there are probably other ways, but none that come to mind this instant.  not all methods agree with each other fully, either. that tells us how things are now, the only real way to know what species were like eons ago is through fossils (though the fossil record is notoriously patchy). However, i think looking at common features in species more and less related can suggest what their common ancestor was like. (say, common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans probably had hair (fur?) and not feathers). i'm by no means any sort of expert, but i hope that helps with what you were looking for.",➕

t5_2rfnm,spinwizard69,1379868192," &gt;Thank you for sharing.  To be frank, I don't have the time or expertise to be able to pursue porting something like Fedora (*which I love and I'm using right now*) to all the pieces of these stick PCs.    That has killed more Linux ports than anything else!!! 😪😪😪   It is a very serious problem.   Even a partial port might spur community involvement.      &gt; I've worked a bit with the organizers of the Picuntu project (*Ubuntu on Rockchip*), mostly by providing some hardware.  Aside from that, I'm not sure what else I can do.  Hire programmers or convince yourself to do the work yourself.  Let's face it these sorts of boards are useless without an operating system that is fairly stable.  So you need a solution to make the board viable in the market.   That being said Rockchips must have some Linux on ARM development going on someplace in the world.   I'd be shocked if nobody was working on porting right now, you need to search out these people and actively help in any way you can.     &gt;I love Fedora, but at the same time if I had to choose, I think I'd rather support a browser OS.  Why?  I think many more small companies will realize the savings in having these thin PCs, as well as consumers.  Thin PC have been touted as the next thing in computing for over a decade now, it never happened because it doesn't make sense.   If that is the market you want to pursue all I can say is best of luck.   Personally I think you are wasting your time.    Think about this, with a normal Linux install the computer can be set up to boot up running a browser effectively in the same way that a Browser OS does.   This could be a simple configuration option.   However with a Linux distro install you have a product with all the capability of Linux for customers that want it that way.    &gt;  At around $70, these computers are very inexpensive and would make wonderful general purpose PCs.  Unfortunately, Android is too limiting.  This boggles the mind!!! If Android is too limiting a browser based OS is going to be a hell of a lot worst.   In fact the two are miles apart here.   I really have a hard time with what you have posted in this regard.   Look at it this way, I really really hate Android and the way Google stole it, using Android is un ethical in my mind.   However it is light years ahead of a browser based OS as far as usability goes.    I'm hoping more people see this thread to comment.  You need a second and third opinion.   Given that though if you don't have the ability to support whatever OS ships on your hardware you will be going no where fast.  You need to address how you will support whatever you put on the card.   ",😪

The only operating issue I have found that I don't like so far is the extra step to sending a photo via txt, email, etc. I don't understand the need for a ""next"" page between choosing the photo &amp; choosing how to sending the photo.  I also started getting irked when my Instagram app started acting dumb &amp; I went to close the app, only to find out that ""dbl click the home button"" was no longer the same. The ""click &amp; hold icon"" now results in opening the app... Then I figured it out... Swipe the ""card"" up to close the app.  I don't have music on my phone ATM (emptied my music folder for photo/video room at the A7X concert &amp; haven't put it back in yet), so I haven't even opened that app to see what it's like.  The new camera style is ok. It's not better or worse, just different.   I love the new ""swooshing"" when you open &amp; close folders &amp; apps...

t5_2qh1i,-pawky-,1379881942,"I get a bit confused with numbers myself but just a little. It's due to errors in my *working memory*.  You're case is obviously more serious. So it's like dyslexia with math?  You said you're very stressed about it, that probably makes it worse.. Pretty difficult to manage such stress but you gotta remember that the problem is not your fault. Even if other people don't understand it and treat you unfairly.  Anywhoo, what helps me is visualization. Well, I visualize pretty much everything but visualizing the symbols of numbers is not helpful, they don't hold any information by themselves, the information has to be remembered. So what I do is visualize them in a more concrete fashion, geometrical.   Ugh, difficult to explain. Like blocks or pillars or anything really that has a shape (and can have other properties too of course, like color) and the blocks or whatever I visualize are proportionally the right size in comparison. Like 5block is half the size of 10block and so forth. [Here's a simple pic.](http://heartofthematteronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Blocks-math.jpg) Halving and doubling these geometric shapes is the basics of this I guess.  I am also rounding numbers quite a bit to simplify the whole thing.  I don't know if any of this helps you, but I sure hope so.  Don't cry. There's kitty pictures and hugs. ♥",♥

t5_2yhy7,Jibodeah,1379897590,"Just here to clarify and give my viewpoint on this. With crappy diagrams!™  ###[Method 1](http://i.imgur.com/yr4uwKz.png)  **Info**  * Emotes are submitted and voted on from midnight until just before midnight.  * Judgement is made at the second midnight.  * Emotes can be submitted and voted on for a 24-hour window.  **Pros**  * Easy to understand.  **Cons**  * Possible confusion with timezones. (We use UTC by the way)  * It is possible to submit an emote and have it face judgement within minutes of being submitted. This obviously puts it at a massive disadvantage compared to an emote that had 24 hours of voting.  ###[Method 2](http://i.imgur.com/4jNqoJg.png)  **Info**  * Emotes are submitted during a 24-hour window. The entirety of day 1.  * Emotes can be voted on as soon as they are submitted.  * Emotes are judged at the end of day 2. This means an emote has been up for a minimum of 24 hours.  * Emotes submitted on day 2 are judged at the end of day 3, and so on...  **Pros**  * Each emote has a minimum of 24 hours to acquire votes. No submitting an emote which gets judged a minute after it is submitted.  **Cons**  * Harder to understand.  * An emote submitted at the beginning of the submission period gets 48 hours total voting. Giving it an advantage over an emote submitted at the end of the submission period which only gets 24.  * Possible confusion with timezones. (Again)  ----  I personally prefer method 2. Submitting an emote that immediately expires is not fair at all, whereas submitting an emote that only gets half as much voting time as another is still not fair, but a hell of a lot better.",™

t5_2we2n,S-Flo,1379915123,"* **How do you feel about Jean’s personality, character development, and role in the story so far?**  He's the most dynamic and possibly the best developed character in the show. He's also one of the more interesting ones to follow because he's not an inhumanly amazing fighter or The Chosen One™ or something like that. His growth from being selfish and self-centered to being willing to put down his life for the sake of others has been great to follow and is made all the more relatable with his constant struggle against his own self-doubt.  It's kind of funny to think that the guy who straight up told the drill sergeant that he joined the military to get a cozy post is now disgusted by the people who did just that [Manga Spoiler](/m ""and later threw himself into a pileup of titans to rescue one of his comrades."").  * **What are your favorite Jean moments**?  Rubbing his ""faith in humanity"" off on Connie was pretty funny, especially since he was ready to make up with Eren right up until that moment.  I also really liked the scene where he watched his deceased friends bodies being burnt and his line about ""charred bones staring back at him"".  * **Any theories or speculation?** [Manga Spoiler](/m ""JeanxMikasa?"")  I think we're actually pretty likely to see something on that front soon considering Jean's [Manga Spoiler](/m ""crazy rescue of her from the cluster of titans""). I've been under the impression that [Manga Spoiler](/m ""while Eren will always be very important to Mikasa, part of her character growth will be her moving past him and learning not to center every facet of her life around him (he's kind of starting to become resentful about it after all). Jean could end up being a sort catalyst for that kind of change."")  [Manga Spoiler](/m ""Or not. Either way, I find his continuing crush on her to be hilarious."")  * **Anything that you** ***dislike*** **or used to dislike about Jean?**  He was a bit annoying when he was first introduced, but I kind of like that part of his character now.

The laundry list of reasons why ""Rapublikanz = baaaaaad, Damocrats = gud!""  Oh look, the old ""I haven't really got a good comeback but I'll pretend to misspell shit so no one will notice. *I R Kool!*""  &gt; That political party disputes the efficacy of said ""safety net,"" noting that the so-called ""War on Poverty"" has had lackluster results since initiated by LBJ.  Bullshit.  Once again, you read bullshit and parrot it like it was fact and once again you get told you don't know what you're talking about.  **First dopeslap** - FRD began the institution of the safety net woth Social Security which had a measurable, documented effect in reducing poverty in our senior citizen population by 50%. Nothing you've pretended to read about or offered as a solution will ever be as effective.  **Dopeslap number two** - Since the initiation of the Great Society, we have seen nothing short of breathtaking reductions in poverty levels until the Contract on America was passed and the levels began to creep up. Add in one rubber-stamping congress and an incompetent conservative president and we're almost back to where we started.  **Dopeslap number one** - [Poverty rates of the elderly](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v64n3/v64n3p23c1.gif)  **Dopeslap number two** - [US poverty rate timeline](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/US_poverty_rate_timeline.gif)  Many of us liberals refer to this as facts.

I think you'll find that the facts show that the reason why you're wrong is that it is obvious that charity wasn't capable of handling the demand.   Strangely, when economic times take a turn into the dumpster, as the invisible hand likes to guide us, people have less money they can give to charity. This, of course, is inversely proportional to the need during these compassionate conservative times so a bunch of us decided that we were going to do something about it and we did.  Equally bizarre is your continued push for private pensions given the carnage of what we saw when the market crashed under the Bush Administration's stewardship of our economy. I honestly thought that the level of decimation seen at that point would put this platform into the grave forever - but it's back.  &gt; They're allowed to disagree, but of course, in doing so, you use terms like ""safety net"" to make them out to be as villainous as possible, and to stifle opposition.  That's because to hold the beliefs you do, based on erroneous data is shameless. But, that's not really a problem for you, you have no shame.  &gt; Neither war would have been possible without Democratic votes.  You do understand that at that period in history the Authorization for Military Use did not need a single Democratic vote to pass, right?  No, apparently you have no idea what a majority in both house of congress as well as a willing president means in this system - but you have a loud and ignorant opinion to share.  &gt; Which one is that? Because from where I'm sitting, the HDI for both Iraq and Afghanistan has actually increased. GDP overall, and per capita for both countries has increased. The people of both nations are having democratic elections, girls are actually able to go to school, and some semblance of free enterprise is occurring.  While you must hate to admit it, GDP is not a measure of how well the people are living, as our very own should clue you into.  Women were always allowed to go to school in Iraq during Saddam's school, there were simply a lot less explosions during that time.  As to your claim that Afghanistan is a better place, that's laughable.  &gt; Make no mistake, I oppose the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I just &gt; 1.) Don't believe I have to be a Liberal to do so, and  A lot of what I consider to be very conservative people opposed both the Iraq war and to a far lesser extent the war in Afghanistan. Nice to have you on our side.  &gt; 2.) Don't believe the Democrats get one red cent of credit when, without their votes, they wouldn't have happened.  Again, you are in error and show a complete lack of understanding how our governmental system works - but at least you're consistent. You've got that going for you.  &gt; You mean, one party has a long and storied history of pushing government further and futher into the healthcare industry, saddling it with more and more increasingly onerous and expensive regulations, and then turning around years later and blaming the free market as a justification to pass yet another law commanding even greater government oversight of the healthcare industry.   No, that's not what I mean but I know you need to believe it, so we'll just run with that.  &gt;The Republicans aren't shining examples of leaders in healthcare policy, but on this one, the Democrats (whose brilliance included Medicare, Medicaid, EMTALA, HIPAA, and now, the ACA) have done far more to drive healthcare costs through the roof -- in pursuit of universal healthcare, the justification for which is completely devoid of any critical thinking (""those countries' graphs are better looking than our country's graph! It MUST be because the government is paying for it!"").  Yes, all those graphs with those facts - they must be wrong.  Here's a simple question that I'm sure you won't have an answer to: exactly what value do we, the American people, see from paying the insurance corporation's profits?  Why don't you chew that one around and get back to me. If you have a fact you can share with that answer, that would be swell - because I am going to serve you an all you can swallow buffet of them if you're ignorant enough to take that one on.  &gt; But hey, don't let that stop you from equating your favorite party's pet projects as ""good,"" and the Republicans as bad, bad, baaaaaaad.  Wouldn't it be nice if everything was a binary like this. It would be a simpleton's paradise!  &gt; The other party, unable to get a single vote from people like you, gets to court religious theocrats, or not get elected.  In case this has escaped you (it has) this is the party whose views you have embraced.  Good luck with that.  &gt; In some cases, sure. In other cases, though, I'm hard-pressed to believe the narrative that says that asking for a photo ID = racism and voter disenfranchisement.  Hard pressed doesn't equate to being correct, it simply means you haven't made the effort to get the information. Damn, you're on a streak with this shit.  &gt; Again, you're painting The Good Guys™ the Democrats' party pet projects as good things that no one is allowed to disagree with. I have nothing against unions or organized labor, but I'm not in favor of ""organized labor"" when it comes to public sector unions, and I'm not a big fan of State favors towards organized labor -- which is largely what the Democrats stand for.   The right of the working public to organize is one the courts have long backed. It is what built the middle class from the ashes of the Gilded Age - but you'd actually have to studied history (and not someone's bastardization of it) to understand this reality.  We call that facts - something you seem to be allergic to. Too bad, if we had universal health care you could get that looked at.  &gt; The backlash against Scott Walker's moves was unbelievable, when what he basically did was made Union dues voluntary, instead of extortionary, and (go figure) some people are taking advantage of that.   Damn, you do believe this shit, that's awesome.   It's still wrong for all the reasons you've been told countless times and I refuse to repeat.  &gt; You would have the State come in and forcibly take parts of these people's paychecks, and put them in Union coffers?   Oh, but these non-union employees are entitled to all the union benefits, right? They should get the same pay, vacation days, health insurance coverage, everything but not pay in? Why is that? Is no cost for the unions to get these benefits for their members?  &gt; Yeah, it's gonna take some smooth talking to convince me that that's a good thing (to the party whose members insist that taxation isn't theft, however, it doesn't surprise me that this is acceptable).  And there we go - taxation is theft. The sign of an intellectually dishonest asshole.  Thanks for completing the Bingo card!   &gt; And, in true Liberal fashion, only one party is on the right side of all of these issues -- because, as we all know, only Liberals possess a monopoly on truth, morality, and justice.  What we can see is that in this discussion, you have no standing nor do you bring any facts. What you do have is a poorly cobbled together fantasy of what you want things to be if only the hard data from the historical record didn't prove you wrong at every turn.  That's got to hurt - so instead of looking at everything from an unbiased view and then making up your mind for yourself, you just scream *""LIBERALS LIBERALS LIBERALS""* and hope it will all go away - but it doesn't.  That's the thing about reality, regardless of what you believe, reality is persistent and pervasive.  &gt; &lt;finish post vilifying conservative pundit, pat self on back&gt;  No, Jack, that's again what is known as a fact, as inconvenient as they are to your pseudo-religious beliefs.  The problem with these beliefs is that they eventually crumble leaving you with only the truth. From some, that can be very disconcerting. Others find it to be so overwhelming that they crack.  Which one are you?",™

t5_2qh2b,danboy4,1379929295,"Hello and welcome!  There are many fun things you can do with your iPhone.  Firstly, iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime. iCloud is in your settings and it is a way to sync your data between devices and back up your whole phone wirelessly. iCloud also has a feature called find my iPhone and it enables you to login to iCloud.com on any computer, locate your device and remotely wipe it, lock it or send it a message. iMessage is sending 'free' texts using data to another apple product be it an iPad, iPod or MacBook. FaceTime is like skype, a video calling application. Like iMessage it can call different apple products.   iOS 7 brings a bunch of new features. For you the best thing is to check out the iOS 7 section on apples website to see all the new features. You can bring up a new control centre by swiping from the bottom of your screen upwards. Try it and have a play. You can enable flash, change brightness and toggle settings amongst other things. To view all your current / recent notifications including your daily calendar, messages and other missed notifications, swipe down from the top of your screen.  You'll start to notice how well everything just works on your phone software wise and you'll probably become proud of your organisation of apps and your new knowledge you learn. I hope people can add to my basic list!  Enjoy your new iPhone! 😀 ",😀
t5_2s960,Baxaxaxa,1379930185,"&gt; ""a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products (such as land, oil, factories, ships, etc.) are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government.""  A mode of production in which the means of production are privately owned, that is indeed. Besides the regular dichotomy of private and state ownership of the MoP, there is the one that really matters: worker ownership (socialism). It merely requires a radical change in the way property is perceived.   Worker ownership is a necessary step after the fall of the state as private (absentee) property can not be maintained without the threat of force. Someone needs to keep ""trespassers"" off of your private island and in contemporary society the state handles the coercion part. If the state would suddenly go away you would have to hire a private security force to defend your private absentee-owned property, which would mean that only big businesses and the super rich would be able to survive and you'd essentially be creating a new ""private"" state.  &gt;If that is the case, then under a government of any kind, private ownership is an illusion.  Stop kidding yourself. This rethoric is completely empty and just screams ""but muh tax muney!1"".   Why are so many ancaps so arrogant to think that they are the ones who will end up on top? Why do you defend the obscene I-got-mine-so-fuck-the-rest-crowd of rich exploiters?  I don't want to do the whole homesteading thing and I don't want to go live in the woods. I want to claim the world back for the disenfranchised masses who built it. If I can't walk on wild land that ""belongs"" to someone but remains completely unused then private property is not a ""voluntary"" institution. Land ownership isn't real. What is real is the piece of paper you hold in your possession that has some text on it that a select group of individuals agrees on to mean that you ""own"" some random piece of land. In the meantime in the real world people are starving and paying a select group of individuals because they are the ones with the magical piece of paper. It is elitist and authoritarian (and delusional) in its essence.   You either misunderstand socialism and property or you are greedy, there are no other ways for capitalist supporters to make sense of the defence of property. It is easy to say that you simply want a system of voluntary interaction when capitalism defines the global cultural hegemon and coercion and alienation are built into the system. We need a radical change of mentality regarding what property and capital mean, and then you'll own everything you could ever need or deserve.  ""Those who work in the mills ought to own them, not have the status of machines ruled by private despots who are entrenching monarchic principles on democratic soil as they drive downwards freedom and rights, civilization, health, morals and intellectuality in the new commercial feudalism.""  There are few things more disgusting to me than a bunch of elitist rich people whose wealth is built on the suffering of millions of ""un-people"" throughout history boasting about Individualism™ and imagining that the weight of the world rests on their shoulders and that in the future being part of the club of capitalist private-monarchs is going to be even more awesome. I was against the state first, but I am an anti-capitalist before I am an anti-statist.   Hypothetically, if the state somehow goes away and you want to go start an ancap society somewhere with some like-minded individuals then you go right ahead of course, but in reality I believe it will either self-destruct or create/become a new oppressive state to sustain itself. Either way, I don't want my revolution to be infested with doublethinking capitalist supporters.",™

I just wanted to say this is an awesome idea and I wanted to see if I could be a part of it. I'd also like to talk to you about possibly joining forces with us and help us out while we help you out! Basically what I'm thinking is giving you guys a little show hosted on our youtube. Whatever reviews you guys do through out the week, I'll take those videos and make like a highlight video covering all of the different reviews and then upload them to our channel and it'll be The Not Quite Noble Reviews show that you can either watch on your channel or ours. In return share our videos and give us a shout out here and there and we'll do the same. Now there's no cash flow or contracts of any sorts so there's no obligation on anybody's part. This is just simply a friendly partnership with no strings attached. Anyway if you're into the idea and would like to talk more comment back or email me at gamesomniac@live.com any time!

I suppose my question is directed more towards the community; how do you care for your mask?  **WARNING:** Clean only with plain water. Chemical cleaners (Windex®,  409®, Simple Green®, etc.) contain alcohol and detergents which can  weaken the lens and goggle.  Remove the lens from the goggle system for proper cleaning. Clean your goggle immediately (same day) after each use or whenever they are dirty or covered with paint. Please follow the lens cleaning instructions carefully to preserve the life of your lens.  *Fog Resistant Single Lens*  Gently clean both sides of the lens with clear water and a cotton cloth. Dry the lens with a clean soft cotton cloth. Do not excessively rub the inner lens surface, it will remove the fog resistant coating.  *Thermal Double Lens*  Gently clean the outside of the lens with clear water and a cotton cloth. Gently dry outside of the lens with a clean cotton cloth. Dab the inner lens with a damp cotton cloth. Do not rub the inner lens surface. The inner lens surface scratches very easily.  *Mask Care*  The mask may be rinsed with a hose or immersed in water. Dry the mask with a soft cotton cloth. Do not dry the mask in direct sunlight.  *Strap Care*  Wipe paint off the strap with a damp cotton cloth. Do not wash the strap in a washing machine. If the strap is severely stained, replace it. The strap is easily removed from the goggle. In ordinary use and maintenance, it is not necessary to remove the strap from the goggle. ",®

Fly a warplane with your buddies above, custom OSK control interface on the screen below. And of course adding to the mix an Oculous Rift for a compact triple display experience while on the road.

t5_2vkaw,The_Old_Gentleman,1379971188,"You are treating wage-labor and absentee property in a vaccuum, ignoring the existing social relation we criticize.  For a more elaborate exposition on our problem with wage-labour, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/1msrja/what_do_an_caps_think_about_imperialism/ccdcfo8).  The problem isn't when a mop and cleaning supplies are owned by Jane and she hires someone to clean for her. The problem is when most natural resources and Capital have been monopolized already and the vast majority of people are forced to sell their labour in order to survive at all, and other class can continually accumulate the product of other people's labour. The problem is when the *only option Jim has in life* it to work for Jane (or someone like Jane).  &gt;Is this exploitative? How would an anarchist society even handle this situation - would it prevent Jane from hiring anyone? would it take her mop buckets and give them to Jim and the others? Would it force Jane to pay Jim $30 instead of $15 (even though Jane is the one finding the business, something Jim has no interest in doing). Would it give Jim a free education so that he doesn't have to work for Jane, and dictate that Jane can't be a home cleaner because obviously the home owners are exploiting Jane with such menial labor?  This is the thing that makes us really mad at An-Caps. You automatically assume most institutions we have today are ""natural"", and reach the conclusion that anyone that wants to organize things differently must be trying to force something unnatural over society. We criticize *any* institution traditionally associated with Capitalism that exists today, and your great line of defense is ""Why, would you use *Force*™ to prevent it?"". Whenever anyone shows how Capitalism today has failed at X and Y you will complain ""BUT, it's not a true free market!"", yet when someone criticizes present institutions (wage-labour, interest, rent, etc) you react with ""What, they must be crazy! Those institutions are natural, as they formed on the voluntary *free market*™!"".  No one wants to force Jane to never hire Jim. We want to make land and means of production currently monopolized through force available, allowing all Jims in the world to employ themselves. We just want to offer Jim a better alternative, so that he doesn't need to work for Jane if he wants access to education.  No one wants to ban interest or ban money exchange. We want to remove the coercive State protections over the money monopoly that allows an oligopoly banking system to form, so that we can create alternative institutions (Mutual Banks, Gift Economies, etc) that people may chose over the old ones.  No one wants to ban people from paying rent. What we want is to prevent the landlord class that monopolized resources that aren't rightly theirs from using a State to force peaceful people to pay rent. If a supposed landowner convinces his tenant that the land is rightfully his (despite it being evident to everyone the tenant is possessing and using it) and the tenant is willing to pay, that's their business, but if the tenant isn't and the landlord wants to force him out we won't enforce this fraudulent contract.  The separation of the worker from his means of production has, historically, *always* and *everywhere* been the result of force and violence. An-Caps defending modern day wage-labour (itself first established by the violent Enclosures and Colonialism, to this day maintained by State protection of class monopolies) on the ""*VOLUNTARY*!"" basis have absolutely no idea of what we are even talking about.  If quoting Marx's Poverty of Philosophy isn't too out of place for a Mutualist, &gt;Economists have a singular method of procedure. There are only two kinds of institutions for them, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions. In this, they resemble the theologians, who likewise establish two kinds of religion. Every religion which is not theirs is an invention of men, while their own is an emanation from God. When the economists say that present-day relations — the relations of bourgeois production — are natural, they imply that these are the relations in which wealth is created and productive forces developed in conformity with the laws of nature.

t5_2ttxy,therationalpi,1379996467,"Today's game is Pokemon Yellow. Playing on a physical copy using a backlit Gameboy Advance SP (only way to fly). I backed up my old save (it still worked!) soldered in a fresh battery for the future, and started up a new game.  To get through quickly, I grabbed Nidoran♂ right off the bat. He gets Double Kick to power through Brock, and his move coverage can see him through pretty much the whole game. I'm not going for ""speedrun"" level times here, but in three hours I got through Lt. Surge with no real issues. At this point, my Nidoking is lvl 37 with Thunderbolt, Body Slam, Thrash, and Horn Attack. I'm working my way towards Ice Beam and Earthquake in those last two slots, which should give me some excellent coverage.  Here are some things I've noticed so far through this playthrough.  * I forgot how ugly some of the sprites in this gen were, and yellow had some of the better ones. Why does Rattata look so janky? Charmander also looks pretty weird.  * It's incredible just how *shallow* this game's mechanics are. Without the physical/special split, pokemon abilities, or many moves that do more that just deal damage or spread status effects it feels like your only choice is which move you want to pummel the opponent with. I know this is fairly true for all gens in the single player game, but it's really striking here.  * Getting all the starters is really nice, even if I'm not using them. I wish this could have become a tradition for later generations, where the third game in the set just gives you all the starters early in the progression.  * I miss unlimited use TM's, and I hate that I have to wait until 5th gen to get them back...  * On the topic of moves, it feels like pokemon in this gen have very shallow movepools. Especially their level up sets, which don't seem to have any cross-type attacks.  * Nidoking is awesome. I never appreciated him back in the day.",♂

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1379997973,"it's time for **RageChat™**  this is a very laboured &amp; overlong Music Defener comic, and while it's a competent genre exercise it's attempts at differentiation do little to improve the comic quality. the cranberries jokes aren't particularly engaging, and the same one is used twice. it makes the choice of band feel random rather than carefully considered, and doesn't have the same impact that the initial choice of queen did.  let's take a step back and consider just *why* queen were a great band for the genre. first off, queen maintain some amount of cultural cachet amongst older generations. secondly, they wrote loud flamboyant music with on-stage theatrics to match, and as such mesh well with the emotional histrionics typical of Music Defener comics. finally, RageArtists™ have a rallying point in bohemian rhapsody: a densely layered song that stands in stark contrast to modern-day musical tropes and that also contains some lyrics that could be said to resonate with the context of the comic. neither ode to my family or zombie really accomplish the same thing, and the cranberries are too far from a cultural institution to really make sense here. i actually really like the cranberries, but they just don't fit the bill.  this is beginning to sound like the ravings of an old curmudgeon who thinks all RageComics™ should adhere to strict formulas in order to achieve greatness, and obviously this is far from the truth. however it seems to me that the Music Defener genre has run its course; nobody has managed to make any significant innovations since the namesake comic came out, and the small ones that do make their way onto the screen just don't offer enough on their own to be truly compelling. it's like eating vanilla ice cream every day and having different toppings. sure it's different, but not by much and before long you're going to get bored of it.  **RageScore™**: 52",™

t5_2vqyb,CAW4,1380032129,"Atlanta FTL here, a bit late to the party.  After sitting in the back of the IFV on the way to town, and hearing a ton of muffled gunfire, we dismounted a few hundred meters away from town. Within a minute of getting out of the IFV, our tank exploded, though I wasn't sure where from. While my team was engaging contacts to the south, our IFV ran off and got all non-functional, while or medic set himself on fire and K1CKA55, my AR, took a few rounds to some of the vital areas of the face.  After seeing all these good omens, we started pushing into town, with relatively light contact, until we reached our first waypoint. While my team crossed a North-South street, we started taking MMG fire from the south, though no one was hit. My team did what we could to support Quex's team, though K1CKA55 once again was taken down. After noting some Iranians trying to flank us, we start focusing more on 360 security, and I radio Quex to say that we won't be able to effectively support him. When he doesn't reply, I peek around the corner and see a bunch of blufor bodies laying in the road. As I concisely relay this information to my team by saying ""Oh shit,"" an Ifrit GMG rolls around the corner and blows us away.  After respawning, we get flown back to around where we dismounted to move in and rescue Daz, who is stubbornly refusing to die. After landing our only contact is a wandering Iranian, who Quex initially believed to be a friendly looking fellow, while I thought he looked like he didn't have enough NATO ammo.  Not long after regrouping with Daz, my connectioned failed. After rejoinging and politely requesting a nearby Iranian to return me to the NATO airbase, I found out that I disconnected just before everyone else exploded. At this point we decided to group up with the Greek, rather than further reduce the Iranian stockpiles of 40mm.  After being flown behind Indiana, we swaggered in, and found them cowering in a house. After Liberating™ the block, we moved up, only for a sneaky Iranian psyops soldier to trick our new allies into shooting Atlanta's squad lead and medic before being taken out. Iranian radio jammers then kicked in for a while as we fixed them up.  After moving further into town with the Greeks, everyone exploded again, and the mission playercount soon decreased as the NATO soldiers at base declared Mission Accomplished™.  **The Good**  * MOUT in Arma 3 is much nicer than in A2, and this was very nice to see in practice when the shooting started  * There was a good amount of bounding, from the Atlanta team perspective  * A large city (that runs at semi-playable frames, *Fallujah*) is a new experience for Arma, and it was interesting to see how fluid we could be with our decision making and movement  * Quex did a very good job, considering he was commanding 2 pieces of armor, a squad, and was in direct control of a fireteam, while one of his radios didn't work  **The Bad**  * Quex had to be in control of 2 pieces of armor, a squad, and be in direct control of a fireteam  * Radio issues, from not working, to randomly switching, to TS crashing (though there's not too much anyone could really do about this)  * Too much ground for too little soldiers  * Not enough direction with the objective. Clearing a town is great on paper, but overwhelming in practice. While we could do a reasonable job of carving a path through, we couldn't move in every direction at once. Simply having a focal point of an objective can help immensely with planning in the long term and the short term.  **The Ugly**  * The remains of Atlanta team  * A sneaky Iranian managing to get Indiana firing on Atlanta while we were moving together  * Everyone's frames.",™

t5_2se24,GrandfatherJesus,1380036437,"From the forum: Hello astute and loyal listeners - you are correct, Gelmania is no longer listed on Earwolf.  I wish I could report some sort of sordid drama that resulted in this happening, but that's just not the case. The truth is that Brett and Cyrus have largely operated independently for almost the entire run of the show. They hit it off with each other immediately and because the show was so production heavy and collaborative between them, they did a lot of the work outside of Earwolf. I remember bitching to Cyrus at the time, ""We can't afford to spend 20 hours a week on one show!"" and him saying, ""I'll do most of it on my own time at home."" And thank god he did. As time went on, that became more and more the case until Cyrus was just sending us files. Which was totally fine, but we were all a little less connected than at the start.  A little while back, I got a call from Brett and he let me know that they were going to start doing something new with Gelmania, hard to even call it a podcast and thought it would be best to do it as it's own thing, that it wouldn't make as much sense for us or them as it used to. I agreed and said we'd help in whatever way we could. We had a good chat and I felt (and still do) good about our role in helping get those two creative geniuses together, but it was time to let them morph into something amazing that I couldn't even fathom.  So it's bittersweet that effective today, Earwolf.com is Gelmania-free. It's been a part of us for a long time and I'm sad to see it go. But at the same time, there is great comedy on the internet in places that aren't Earwolf and that's a good thing for everyone. These guys are going to make world changing content and I look forward to watching the ®evolution and supporting however I can.  Thank you Brett and Cyrus for giving us a chance to work with you and be associated with some of the most thoughtful, gritty and well produced comedy in podcasting, you'll be missed!   http://forum.earwolf.com/topic/13113-why-has-gelmania-disappeared/page__view__findpost__p__72317",®

Ah well.   &gt;[Exploitive:](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exploitive?s=t)  &gt;1. To utilize, especially for profit; turn to practical account: *to exploit a business opportunity.*  &gt;2. To use selfishly for one's own ends: *employers who exploit their workers.*  &gt;3. To advance or further through exploitation; promote: *He exploited his new movie through a series of guest appearances.*   Just to make sure we're on the same page with our definition. I assume we're both using it as defined at point 2, yeah?   I'm arguing that Jane is indeed using these workers selfishly for her own ends, therefor she is exploiting them.   &gt;I ask, how can this be exploitative?   Because she's using her connections with rich homeowners to grab up all the lucrative housekeeping jobs in her area. Much more work than she could do on her own, so she brings in others to do it for her. She's only giving them half of what they could have been making if she didn't take up all the contracts in town, and siphons off half of the profit that was made by the worker directly into her own pocket book. She's exploiting vulnerable college kids whom no one else would actually hire, who have no other options. The wage seems lucrative compared to most jobs available, so they take it. Little do they know how parasitic their boss's relationship is.   In reality, I've seen this happen. They pay us about $8.25, because all they have to do is put a wage up that is only a hair above the mean wage offered in the area for fast food service. This is from talking to the CEO of a large hospital in my area. My boss. If you bring up the issue of, ""It's very fucking difficult to live on $8.25 an hour, and you're only giving me 5 hours a day"" the usual rebuttal is ""it's a competitive wage for the area.""   So if we want to make our numbers more realistic, we should factor in that Jane probably wouldn't offer 15 an hour, because that doesn't make economic sense from the perspective of your serious capitalist. She'd be offering something not above 10, likely far below. Unless she's got a gingerbread heart, or she's actually a leftist, she's likely going to be paying them shit wages. This makes the relationship much more parasitic, I'll leave the number crunching to you for this one.  &gt;Jane herself bought the means of production and started her business. Each and every employee has the exact same opportunity (no one is physically stopping them).  A fair thing to bring up. Theoretically, it would seem that they all have a fair shot at this. But this is not necessarily the case, unless of course Jane's got a gingerbread heart, and she's just too darn sweet that she wouldn't ***CRUSH*** her competition before it got a leg up.   Jane, as she is a capitalist with an interest in self preservation and expanding of her business, would continue expanding until she had a lock down on her locale. She would be the person to call if you wanted your place cleaned. She might even lower her prices a good margin to discourage competition after she's expanded above even just 5 people, as she can **afford** to do it quite easily at this point.   Suddenly *James* decides he's fed up with working for that *parasite* Jane and decides to start his own housekeeping empire. It'll have flowers, and kittens, and ponies, and uh... oh! It'll be a worker owned housekeeping company! It'll be **GREAT™**  But he soon finds that he can't compete with Jane. She's now offering her service for for a good $20 per hour, promising a professional job done with high tech cleaning equipment. It would seem Jane invested her capital she accumulated from the fat of the workers to upgrade her **""means of production.™""** She's now offering her service for less money, and it's now a better service. James can't compete with that, he can't afford that $10,000 auto scrubber for industrial cleaning contracts, or that $5000 carpet scrubber, or that recurring $1000/month fee for advanced bulk chemicals. She simply owns the market.  So what are Jame's options? Most people would tell him to leave and try it in another place. But the catch 22 is that he's a college student. He's ***STUCK.*** He doesn't have the option to leave and do it some other place. So his only choices are really to be a wage slave for Jane, work for even less than what Jane's offering somewhere else, or starve.   Hi, I'm kind of James if it isn't completely obvious yet. Different details, similar position.  If I missed any of your points that you'd like addressed, nag me and I'll come back to it, but I think I covered most of it!",™

t5_2qh0u,RamsesThePigeon,1380044796,"That's a fair suspicion to have.  It's a fairly well accepted fact that some Reddit content is not-so-subtle marketing. Granted, a lot of the hype about things is user-generated, but that's occasionally in response to manufactured anticipation. For example, we've seen a lot of talk about Grand Theft Auto V in /r/Gaming in the past several months, some of which was undoubtedly urged onward by the folks who made the game. After that, common Redditors picked up the craze and ran with with, either in pursuit of Karma or simply because they were excited for the upcoming release.  The thing is, it's not all bad. A lot of great discussions and entertaining links have both manifested as a result of these tactics. Personally, I'm excited for a Dumb and Dumber sequel, if only because the original movie was so heavily quoted in my adolescence. While I might be a little bit irritated to learn that I'd been hoodwinked, there's no reason to dismiss something simply because it's an advertisement. If it's creative, amusing, and leads to something more, I'd say it's worthwhile content.  Besides, if it bothers you... why not relax with a nice, refreshing can of Coke Zero™?",™

I have learned much from the disparaging mistakes of my own parents and can only feel hope as I know without a doubt that I can be more for my child than my parents were for me. There will be no church trying to dictate to my child concepts that would wedge us apart. I cant help but feel fatherly pride, love, and appreciation at the idea that I can take everyone to the park on sundays for a leisurely picnic rather than being scolded for being a horrible person at church.

t5_2rxrw,thebitchrake,1380045881,"Failed birth control. I was puking it up, apparently, which then became morning sickness. TWICE. TWO TIMES.     First time (I was about 15 weeks), I went to a little clinic for a two-day procedure (laminaria insertion, then the...suction?). I felt terrible. I reacted poorly to everything and it was a two-hour ride there and back both days. I was back at work in a couple days, and no emotional fallout because I didn't want to be pregnant. There were no protesters that day.     Second time (I was about 17 weeks) was much smoother at a major clinic. The staff was amazing and they talked with me about why I was going for my second abortion and what birth control I was on, which is how I found out I can't handle progesterone (confirmed years later when I took progesterone-based muscle relaxants). They then suggested a copper IUD (♥ my new best friend) and sent me for muscle relaxants which I reacted horribly to. Procedure was painful, and the attending nurse held my hand while I yelled, but I got ginger ale and crackers after (I did the first time, too, and it's perfect). I was a little woozy, but not much. Post-op was basically in the waiting room, with the rest of the women and everyone was in a pretty good mood.     I Was fine. If you don't *want* to be pregnant, then you most likely won't have a big emotional reaction.  I only tell people this if they want abortion advice/help or they're a long-term SO. ",♥

Let's also imagine that it was chiefly populated by some demographic (to keep from prejudicial we'll just call this society of individuals simply ""Society"") that had a notoriously problematic ideology. It wouldn't need to be many, but eventually the feedback loop may *gasp* reinforce or justify all sorts of horrible behavior through sheer repetition.  It's down right Orwellian and we, the internet, are the only people who can stop it.  tl;dr: Freedom. Eagle. Rock and Roll.   ",™

t5_2rron,olcon,1380066188,"&gt;any other weird stories that have nothing to do with anything?  It was a burning hot day in the Sandy Plains.  This was the main thought going through the head of the young biologist, who from here on out shall be known as Fred. Fred had gotten a report of a rare Nibelsnarf in the area, which apparently was wreaking havoc on the local Rhenoplos population. Hunters had been dispatched to deal with it, according to the Guild. That was fine by him - he was there to analyze the impact on the ecosystem, not the beast itself.  The biologist chugged another Cool Drink™, relief instantaneously spreading across his body. The desert was a harsh mistress, that much was certain.  Fred knew he was approaching the area the Nibelsnarf had claimed as its own. He could tell by the distinct patterns in the sand, as well as the many blood splatters that most definitely represented some poor Rhenoplos' site of death. But his attention was drawn away by what sounded like... music?  In the hazy distance he could make out a large figure. Upon moving closer, he could see it was the corpse of the Nibelsnarf in question. Shrouded by the massive form was what had to be a hunter - probably the same one the Guild had sent to slay the monster. His armored form was hunkered over what appeared to be a BBQ spit; cooking over the fire was a slice of meat as large as Fred's own thigh.  The determination with which this hunter turned the meat was fascinating. The giant man hadn't even noticed Fred's presence, such was the intensity of his focus. The music continued to repeat in the background; it was a strange occurrence, as Fred couldn't see a source. It seemed to be radiating from the BBQ spit itself.  And then... something happened.  Fred felt the very air around him shift, grow more intense. The hunter had slowly begun to stand up, his hand never leaving position on the turner, upon which the meat situated. Then, in that climatic, almighty moment, the hunter removed that perfect slab of meat from the spit.  Fred felt the very fabric of reality ripple around him. He felt his eyes water in pure, unadulterated joy as he beheld that piece of meat. The corpse of the Nibelsnarf lay long forgotten, a mere background prop upon the stage that was The Meat.  The hunter hefted The Meat high above his head, his armored form releasing a rumbling shout of triumph. He had succeeded in his goal; he had labored over that piece of art, shaped the gloriousness of The Meat with his own calloused hands and an exhaustive amount of care. The Meat sparkled in the air, its existence alone causing the atmosphere to part ways and declare the holy triumph. A single beam of sunlight illuminated The Meat in that instant, and Fred understood that the sun itself was bowing before that hallowed sustenance.  A rumble echoed across the land, and in that instant Fred beheld the voice of divinity itself. Its beautiful words flowed into him, through him, and caressed the young biologist with images of heaven, perfection, and a full stomach. And thus, in that desert, on that day, it was proclaimed:  **""SO TASTY!""**  edit: http://imgur.com/OlXwAPt ",™

The day I saw the last movie, I went out to dinner with my parents (after) and literally sat in the booth at Culver's and CRIED. I just silently cried. Because I didn't know what to do with myself or my life without the potential for more HP. It was silly, I know that, but I was lost. I coined the term Post Potter Depression (PPD), and my family was seriously worried about me. I have lots of HP stuff on my wish list, and I have had a bunch of it purchased for me already, gratefully!!!  1. I'd probably ACTUALLY be Ravenclaw, because I'm brilliant and I know it but I'm quite humble about it (except for right then), but I tell people I'd be in Gryffindor like Hermione, because she was smart as hell, but her courageous nature (and probably the fact that the hat knew those three were destined to become friends and balance each other out)  2. I'M A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER, so I often fantasize that I'd find a powerful wand one day and be able to control my students or punish them in funny ways when they were terrible (ex., every day. Just kidding, most of my kids are amazing at least 65% of the time!). I have a billion spell ideas, but here are some:  Snorbius makes the sleeping kids' heads snap up and eyes pop open  Ledillus glues a pen or pencil into someone's hand and stands their hand upright on a piece of paper so he is prepared to begin an assignment  Garbus Lux sends all the garbage and candy wrappers on the floor right into the pocket of the person who dropped them there (that's what I get for rewarding and bribing my lazy students with candy).  3. (&lt;---It keeps defaulting back to 1) My favorite character (besides the obvious three) is Luna (I named my husky after her) for many reasons. She went through a terrible childhood with her mom's death, but it made her stronger. She has a constant positive outlook. She's **NEVER** afraid to be herself, no matter how unpopular she is or becomes. And eventually, people learn to respect her for just that. She's goofy and silly (just like my dog of her namesake), and she is a fierce and loving friend.  ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥  I had a rough day teaching today, and this was EXACTLY the kind of contest I wanted to come home to!

Limiting functionality on the most common device to make it ""easier"" to use on another device indicates different window managers should be developed for differing purposes.  The effect is that as people are starting to use Linux the user interface they will have the most interaction with has become harder to use and less functional.  The result is a distaste for Linux from those trying it out for the first time.    Money is driving development now.  Not demand.  Dell, Asus, et. al. are working with the developers and pushing a specific agenda that works with their business model.  They want to sell Windows® desktops and Linux-based tablets and netbooks.  They get a discount on the front end on Windows® licenses and can easily turn a $500 sale into a $600 on a primary use computer, but on a netbook or other ancillary computing device people want the entire thing for about $100-200.  They aren't going to value Windows® enough on such a limited-use device to the same extent, and especially not 50% increase in the overall cost.

Now that you mention it, I guess FedEx acquiring SmartPost was to eliminate a lower-cost competitor more than anything else. It would presumably be in their interest if no one else could leverage USPS to create a competition for FedEx Ground. Sneaky stuff.   &gt;FedEx purchased the parcel consolidator Parcel Direct in September 2004 from Quad Graphics. This FedEx Ground subsidiary was re-branded as FedEx SmartPost in October 2004. FedEx SmartPost uses FedEx for the journey and uses the US Postal Service[2] for final delivery to residences. FedEx SmartPost’s customers include e-tailers and catalog companies who have little urgency to have deliveries fulfilled to their customers. FedEx SmartPost also offers a Returns service for higher-volume clients that allows customers to complete returns at all U.S. Postal Service® (USPS) locations in addition to FedEx locations. Pickups are completed by two different groups within FedEx Ground based on expected volume:  &gt; * FedEx Ground Contractors pick up packages for ""Smart Post Small Shipper"" clients and transfer these packages to SmartPost within the FedEx Ground Hubs  &gt; * FedEx SmartPost trailers pick up packages for ""Smart Post Large Shipper"" clients and move the packages within the FedEx SmartPost network directly.  &gt;The resulting service is one that is less expensive than FedEx Ground but more expensive than regular mail and generally takes two to four days longer than standard FedEx ground shipping, with tracking information but without a guarantee of service.  &gt;Amazon.com uses FedEx SmartPost for many of its orders in the continental U.S. if the Free Super Saver option is chosen. Amazon.com is now also using FedEx SmartPost for its Prime 2-Day shipping service in select areas.  ",®

One is making a judgment and imposing their will/beliefs on another, while the latter is simply stating their truth for discussion and challenge by the other party.  One wants you to change, the other wants you to come into agreement with them, or force them into agreement with you.    I am fully open to any discussion you may be capable of providing in which evidence and/or logical constructions are provided in which my fundamental beliefs are altered.  That is why I made the statement of truth publicly in a context where others are likely to disagree with me.  This conversation is not for you, or anyone else specifically.  It is me testing my truth in public.  And as a result of all this discussion the media and their players (actors) are all still producing a narrative designed with the intention of deceiving us.  Some may be complicit in the deception, enjoying the ""entertainment"" of it, and some may not.  But so far no person has convinced me that these two people's friendship has any relevance or bearing on my life, nor that I should expend any amount of energy understanding, retaining or correlating such information.

The pilot has to really push hard on the yoke to keep the nose in a reasonable attitude because of the low under wing engines. The effect can be mitigated somewhat by slowly adding power rather than slamming the throttles forward and pushing the TOGA button. Another thing worth mentioning is a sudden engine failure (seizure) at the moment of the go around. This was demonstrated to me in the simulator as we went around, at minimums, on a low auto land CAT 3 approach. Just as we added power the engine failed. The autopilot was unable to manage the asymmetrical thrust and clicked off. This put a severely untrimmed airplane in my hands only 50 feet off the deck with no visibility. 😬 I avoided a crash but it was quite a ride. It was probably the most challenging maneuver I've ever had to perform. That possibility is definitely in the back of my mind when I have to consider a go around. ",😬

t5_2qh4r,left_one,1380131049,"You can't find a single sentence in the constitution using the word inalienable, I think you should work on your reading comprehension.   The constitution provides limits on the **federal government's** ability to infringe upon your rights, not governments in *'theory'*. That's a pretty big failure in comprehension on your part. Given the fact that we are talking about a municipal government, no less, it's a humorous bit of ignorance on your part.   &gt;The constitution itself says that the government cannot infringe on many inalienable rights. I need no supreme court decision to restate the clear text of the Constitution. Further, many human rights have been ruled and affirmed that are not included in the limited number of inalienable human rights actually specified in the Constitution.  The entire purpose of the supreme court *is* to interpret the constitution, so if you think that simply means restating - then fine, but it's your own misunderstanding. Suggesting that the supreme court nevertheless interprets the constitution *anyway* isn't exactly making your point. But I guess you don't understand that!  &gt;Furthermore, this specific example under question is about free speech. You qualify the conversation as ""any limitations of your rights"" when the conversation we are having is about one specific and prominently ordered right enumerated and protected in the Constitution. The question you ask is impossible to answer. It was constructed either through ignorance or malice.  Questions are questions. We are talking about legal concepts. Your right to live free is constrained by the same right of other's. It's a very simple concept. For the different rights, they each have their own inherent limitations. Your right to free speech does not grant you the right to slander. **Really - what about that don't you understand??**  &gt;Even further, when discussing our rights the term ""illegal"" and ""unlawful"" have specific meanings. For example, laws have been constructed outlawing free speech, making their enforcement ""legal"", however as laws can be unlawful the enforcement of unlawful, yet legal, laws is itself unlawful. So, on yet another level your question is impossible to directly answer. A law which is unconstitutional is referred to as ""unlawful"" not ""illegal"", as many unlawful laws are legal.  Yup - that's why I used 'unconstitutional' and put the other in parenthesis in case your simple-ass was confused. Sure enough you went the other way!  &gt;It amuses me more than it probably should that you are so adamant in your abilities when every statement you make further illustrates your misconceptions on the subject. Deriding, goading and name-calling are not ways to encourage healthy debate. It's a good way to run off a descent debate opportunity though. I don't mind if you think I'm incapable of defending myself. I do not base my opinion of myself or my abilities on your opinion of the same.  Ok, captain obtuse. Why don't you not make your point some more while talking about everything else! That sounds like Real Debate™.  &gt;The original question you asked indicated that you do not understand the fundamental nature of rights and the Constitution. Your subsequent attitude indicates that you are not someone who responds to criticism well.  I think you need to stop thinking about how much a wedgie your panties are giving you, and actually respond to my point. You seem to be missing some very simple legal concepts over there, so maybe you can do some reading and get back to us. Maybe you should appeal to the higher authority that granted you such rights and ask him what it means in the context of *the actual constitution*. ",™

t5_2ti4h,Tashre,1380148739,"&gt; My second thought was to paint some completely messed up lines   http://i.imgur.com/eQjovYm.png  *** Alright, because it's my day off and I've got too much time on my hands, I had to run the numbers on this.  [Using this eHow page as my source](http://www.ehow.com/facts_6804116_parking-lot-striping-layout-standards.html), I sketched up two different lots utilizing 9'x18' parking spaces and single direction travel lanes allowing for 12' wide aisles. I started with a 100ft^2 grid and expanded slightly as necessary.  - The regular lot: http://i.imgur.com/0NmED3d.png   I angled the spaces by 30° to try and keep it realistic (trying to turn into a parking space at a 90° angle from a narrow aisle is a huge pain in the ass, though these kinds of lots do exist in places). As well, there are 12' wide travel lanes at the front and back, allowing for *somewhat* of a modular design.   **Results:** ***36*** parking spaces in just a hair under 11,600ft^2 (100'x116' or 1.0652 roods).  - The Swastikalot™: http://i.imgur.com/QRGLazG.png   I wasn't sure if I should angle the spaces or not, but ultimately decided on not doing so in order to preserve the image. The inner spaces would be difficult to maneuver into an out of, but the outer spaces would have the advantage of opening up into the travel lanes, though a 3-point maneuver might be necessary to fit snugly inside them. 12' wide travel lanes are placed all around and throughout. (credit to /u/Varyter for the doubled spaces idea)   **Results:** ***32*** parking spaces in 11,664ft^2 (108'x108' or 1.0711 roods).  *Conclusion:* The regular lot managed to fit 4 more parking spots into 64 less square feet, making it **~13.121%** more efficient than the Swastikalot™. Not bad, IMO, for a tradeoff between practicality and aesthetics.  ^(*[Note: I am not a civil engineer, nor do I have any sort of formal training toward that end, so my designs and methods may be flawed. This is entirely the amateur work of someone with no life]*).",™

It's worth noting that we're posting in a thread that presupposes that a purchaser of a Hero Atlas is bad at mathematics. Instead of bee-lining for the smallest amount of money to get the Atlas, a cost-conscientious purchaser should go for the next largest package above the MC amount they want.  Instead of spending $37, one could bump to $50 for 12000MC. That means that the Boar's Head only costs ((7500/12000)*49.95), or about $31. That still leaves 4500MC.  That could buy you -  15 'Mech Bays  5 to 9 Premium Paints   Between 6 and 36 cockpit items  And that's only stuff that's not on sale. If you wait for an item/paint sale, double those quantities. If you wait for a Hero 'Mech sale, then you could get ((4500*1.3)/75) tons or 78 tons in Hero. If the right sale comes along, that could net you a Protector, a Bay for it, and a cockpit hologram. And that's the leftovers from buying a package for your Boar's Head!  If people had better business sense, then we could avoid this pointless circlejerking all the time. ",♥

t5_2qmeb,Ranbased,1380170940,My ex texted me why I was acting strange so I replied with this. I guess she really wanted me to go green 😒,😒
t5_2qxih,Techno77,1380170979,"Well, first off. I hate petitions. They don't strike me as coming from a place of communication, they come off as a strong arm tactic to bully the developers into making the changes the author wants. A lot of ""signatures"" come from bandwagoning and not any real support.    &gt; We would like to see these changes happen within the year of this date. This should be a very fair and lenient time frame, but we hope you can execute these changes as soon as possible (and please, no soon™!).  Lines like the above certainly don't impress upon me that it's not an ultimatum.  Developers, like most people, don't respond well to ultimatums.  &gt; Our first request is that we implore you to read that petition, respond to it and hopefully have a change of heart of RWZs.  That's all that really needed to be said. I read mention of the words ""quit"" and ""unsubscribing"" about 4 times in that PVP section.  They *know* how many people have quit. They know that some may leave over that decision. Bringing it up over and over again just sounds like a warning as if the developers are totally oblivious.   I DO agree that removal of any content is bad. MMO's should add content, not remove it. I have faith the developers know this and have considered it.    What I don't see in this petition is a strong argument as to why they should be added back in besides ""We want them added"".  I would like to see some strong, compelling reasons as to why 8v8 ranked warzones alongside 4v4 ranked arenas are needed.   &gt; With a lot of the new content, guilds will return to SWTOR, complete the Op a few times and leave due to boredom.  Anecdotal. That's not evidence of anything. You don't make design and feature decisions based on anecdotes.  With a little searching, I can find an anecdote to serve any point I want to make. With some lying  and exaggerating, I can make it seem like a huge deal even.  &gt; Hard Mode SHOULD be significantly harder—not just a tiny bit—and you should not be able to complete Hard Mode until you are 80–90% in whatever tier gear that is dropped in Hard Mode.  Huh? So, I need most of the gear that is dropped in that mode to complete said mode. Isn't that a bit of a catch 22? I need to beat the mode to get the gear I need to beat the mode.  That makes no sense to me.  Maybe I'm missing something but I think beating a mode would be more fun, than getting 2/3rds of the way or even 1/2 of the way through it every time.   I would think a progression like this makes more logical sense. I need to be in 90% STORY MODE drops to beat hard. I need 90% Hard mode drops to beat nightmare.  I need full nightmare gear to beat challenge bosses and to beat hard mode of the next ops tier.  Lather, rinse repeat.  &gt; Regarding Individual Boss Fights:  This I agree with. Boss 2 should be harder than 1 and so on till the last boss being the most difficult.  Boring maybe, predictable maybe, but it's less frustrating overall.  &gt; Additionally, the PvP community is very bothered by the fact we’ll get no credit whatsoever for the daily and weekly missions for Ranked Arenas. You’re making it to where there’s even less of an incentive to participate in Ranked Arenas.  I agree with this. Every play style should have some sort of tangible reward.  &gt; Our fifth request is that we implore you to address the suggestion of rejoining a PvP match after disconnecting.  Totally agree. That's a reasonable request.  &gt; Our sixth request is that we implore you to fix the issues with the referral program and to try and compensate those who didn’t receive the rewards they're entitled to.  Again, totally agree. That's just common sense. I would hope they are already on the path to getting that working.  &gt; At the moment, it seems like most of the benefit rewards have been titles. This request can be debated with good points raised on both sides, but surely there’s room for improvement somewhere!  Again agreed, but with the understanding that honestly, they owe subs nothing outside of what is promised in the license agreement (ie we get to play).  Not asking for the moon, but something snazzier than a title would be appreciated.  &gt; Class Balance and Bugs  Well, confirmed bugs should be fixed. No question. As far as class balance, I don't even know. It's a forever argument in every mmo till the end of time. I trust the developers are doing their best but honestly, this might as well just be implied as forever ongoing unless there is a tremendously severe issue happening.   &gt; Our tenth request is that we implore you to listen to your players on the PTS more often and try to interact more frequently.  Interaction I can agree with. But I won't even get started on the ""you're not listening to us!!!!"" BS.  That's just code for ""Address my issue specifically to my satisfaction, in writing, the moment I demand it"".    &gt; These testers take hours of their time out of the normal playtime to help test the game for you, and provide invaluable feedback so you can greatly improve an upcoming patch.  Of. Their. Own. Volition.  This is entitlement. If you don't feel like your testing is being properly appreciated, then don't test. Nobody is forcing you.  &gt; It took you guys several weeks to get bolster working as intended.  Because it was broken. Jesus christ.  Yeah. It's a complex system.  You don't fix stuff like that with a flamethrower, you fix it with precision and that takes time and iteration.   &gt; The heavily modified pre-alpha engine must be an extremely difficult task to code and improve, but we hope these improvements keep coming because it’s annoying how the ability delay resurfaces, and FPS decrease for certain customers with random patches again and again.  Is it just me or does this come off as condescending? At least that first part anyway.  All I can say is that bugs should get fixed. That's all I ask.   &gt; Forum Interaction   My favorite part.  &gt; The moderation of these forums has always been pretty strict, and many of us are guilty of resorting to flaming and trolling and the like, but by no means do we visit these boards to purposely flame and troll, etc.  Intent doesn't mean anything. If you aren't purposefully flaming and trolling then DONT DO IT.  Real simple.  &gt; From my experience, I’ve had a pretty rough time with the moderation here. I just don’t think it’s fulfilling its goal of being friendly and welcoming if it’s so easy to be slapped with a warning or infraction for those who are more pessimistic of the game, BW/EA, etc.  Oh boo hoo. Again. There is a difference between CONSTRUCTIVE discussion and not constructive.  You can be as negative as you like, provided it's constructive.  Again, real simple.   &gt; As you can see, previous moderation was far stricter, and with that being said, our twelfth request is that we implore you to do something for those who had sanctions imposed on in the past. Allison and Joveth really made it hard to start any pessimistic topics and discussions, but it feels the same way with the current and new infraction system in place.  I would imagine that those people who have ""sanctions"" imposed on them had them imposed for a good reason.  If they couldn't play nice before, there is no reason to believe they could play nice again. In my experience, offenders either always repeat, or do it once and never again.  I would imagine anyone who got banned, wasn't for a first offence.  &gt; Additionally, with our twelfth request (as it pertains to the forums), I hope interaction on the forums can be increased in other areas. As an avid PvP’er, it’s extremely rare to get a yellow post in the PvP forums. I think most of us who avidly visit the PvP forums can say the PvE forums (FPs, Operations and Heroics) get more responses, but I hope the CMs can see how ignoring other parts of the forum isn’t very helpful and we hope that activity can be increased around the board.  While I agree it would be nice if everyone in every forum could get their own dedicated yellow name to post in there, it's just never gonna happen. Does anyone here that frequents this sub comment on every single post in it? No, of course not.  But I bet you read a hell of a lot more than you comment. I know I do. Does this mean I'm ignoring everything I don't comment on?   &gt; Polls  The problem with polls is they are too general and too easy to misread. Not every discussion can have all it's points summed up into 3 or 4 options and a poll with a 100 choices is unreadable.  Just make a thread.  It's easier.  I don't understand the obsession with polls.  &gt; Unsubscribed as of the 1st of May.  yeah. Again. Ultimatum.  Having that as a signature is like ...I don't even know.  It's like they are trying to have the moral high ground.  Anyway, that's my opinion on it.   TL:DR - More to the point constructive discussion. Less passive aggressive ultimatums and a lot less ""speaking for everyone"".   ",™

To grossly paraphrase our earlier discussion, one of your arguments was ""Fibre sucks because we're going to break the speed of light, and bring that technology to the consumer market within 10-15 years"". Anyone who studied high-school physics can tell you that is laughable at best.  In other words, the No-NBN folks are having credibility issues.

t5_2rq9c,Rumtin,1380175958,"&gt;But yeah, fuck new features  Funny you should mention this as I'm sure that's exactly what CA had on their minds during the development of R2. You can't really call them ""New"" features when they pretty much removed the majority of them, i.e:  ▶the ability to order infantry units to fire at will.  ▶the family tree.  ▶the ability to select which settlement is your factions capital (anyone playing as Sparta in both coop and head to head with someone playing as Athens can tell you how annoying this is).  ▶the technology/traits/skill trees.  ▶the in game cut scenes for agent actions.  ▶the ability to select your factions heir.  ▶the ability to toggle guard mode.   ▶routed/broken units flashy white banner (didn't want to kill those guys off anyways).  ▶generals speeches (Midevil 2 had some of the best, now we get a few words of ""go kill shit, you men!""... yeah, real motivating).  ▶diplomatic options   ▶broken formations (because the greeks using the phalanx formation as their main form of how their armies fought was just a myth).  There's a shit ton more I could list, but I'm sure by now you get what I'm saying. CA's answer to people complaining about how they gutted and butchered the UI is simply: go read the encyclopedia for the full version. Fuck that, stop being lazy and rellying on a shitty tool tip that gives you at best a less than half-assed description.   &gt;let's not interrupt the circlejerk  What you call ""circlejerk"" is what many developers and publishers call a Fan Base, its thanks to these communities that games become series, and have things known as ""attractive traits"" that define what makes the game(s) good and worth playing. Shitting on them by releasing a game that still qualifies as a Beta is a good way to slowly erode your most dedicated customers who pay the bills by buying these titles. So yeah, I think most developers and smart business owners would rather not want to *interrupt* the flow of **income**.",▶

t5_2qzb6,sylban,1380208714,"The whole SEX OFFENDER™ system was well-intentioned, but designed by a combination of hysterical people and craven politicians, so that we now have the judicial equivalent of diploma mills, turning out officially Bad People that an increasing number of citizens are realising are not what they're being presented as. Because our judicial system is so vicious and rapacious, nearly everyone now personally knows a ""Sex Offender™"". And like those who personally know Muslims, gays, and potheads, they know that the system is not telling the whole truth, and that the label does not mean what it claims to. We all know there are some bad people out there, and that some of them are sex offenders, but most of us also now know that most officially designated sex offenders are not bad people.  A very dear friend of mine was recently sent up on even more serious charges, of child molestation. We all know the charges are false, because we all know the person making the accusation is crazy and vicious. (Most of us have known her for many years, and steered clear of her. Our friend was not so wise, and is now paying for his mistake.) The evidence was dubious at best, but the charges are very serious, and the stakes very high -- up to 30 years. He had run out of money to fight it, and facing that much time he copped a plea, to limit the potential damage. He got 2.5 years, plus probation, and is eligible for up to half off.  In order to reach that point, he had to endure a lengthy questioning by the judge in which he basically had to cop to all kinds of things he does not agree with, including that the charges are factual and that he was not 'pressured' or 'threatened' in any way. But of course he was threatened, with spending decades of his life behind bars if a judge or jury found the state's case more persuasive than his. And though innocent, besides serving time he'll have to carry the blistering stigma the rest of his life, and will never be able to have a normal life. All this because he made one error in judgement with one crazy person. ",™

t5_2qrz4,oldepharte,1380214389,"That depends how how you define it.  In the strict technical sense, PiaF is not a fork, but here is the difference.  In a normal FreePBX distribution, such as the FreePBX distro which is from the creators of FreePBX, you get an operating system (usually CentOS unless you're on a Raspberry Pi, then sometimes it's a Debian derivative), Asterisk, FreePBX, and maybe one or two additional pieces of major software that the developer of the distro deems so useful that everyone should have them.  However, PBX in a Flash, is a whole other animal, for three reasons.  One, it's like a freakin' Christmas tree, with a huge number of mostly useless add-ons that hardly anyone will ever use (and the most useful ones can probably be installed separately in another distro if you really want them).  This adds ""bloat"" to your system. and gives you a lot more to potentially configure.  If you are the sort of person that loves playing with toys, this might impress you, but if you just want a reliable system to handle phone calls then all that is just so much superflous crap.  All the REALLY good stuff is already built into FreePBX, or available in one of the FreePBX repositories.  Second, once you get PBX in a Flash, you are pretty much locked into their infrastructure.  This means that you have to use their update methods, which are basically packages of updayes.  If you don't want to update a certain item, or would like an update that's not yet in their updates, that's tough.  If you ""go off the reservation"" and get your own updates for Asterisk of FreePBX, you risk breaking things.  If you change any of the configuration files, you may find all your changes are overwritten the next time you try to update.  Basically, you become a captive to that entire system, for better or worse.  Very inexperienced users may appreciate this for a while, but as you gain more knowledge and experience, you may start to feel chafed by the confines of PiaF (to a lesser degree, that can also be said of FreePBX).  Third, PiaF has an interesting security model.  I once saw a post on another forum (BroadbandReports, perhaps ?) where someone said or implied that Ward Mundy is allegedly a paranoid loon about security (gotta be careful how I say that because he's an attorney!), and that every time he reads an article somewhere about hackers invading some corporate phone system, he goes bonkers and starts looking for new ways to lock down PiaF (note that this is just someone's opinion, not a statement of fact!).  Can there ever be such a thing as too much security?  Sure there can, because remember that usually the whole point of having a PBX is so that you can connect to the outside world, or so you (or maybe your Aunt Matilda, if you choose to give her an IP Phone or a VoIP adapter) can connect to your PBX from outside your local network.  With any of the other distributions based on FreePBX you will be able to do this, and there are still easy ways to lock the system down against hackers (fail2ban and iptables, and Asterisk's built-in security features).  If you run PBX in a Flash, however, things can get considerably more difficult.  I believe I read somewhere that even one of their own developers thinks they go too far.  So if you only want to use your PBX for internal extensions (no off-site ones, unless you want to fiddle around with security software every time you want to make a call) and for connections to Google Voice and some ""approved"" providers, then PiaF might work for you.  Otherwise, I would suggest sticking with something like the FreePBX distro (which has its own faults) or Elastix (which used to be a great distro but appears to have suffered from a bit of neglect), or if you want to run it on a Raspberry Pi, then RasPBX.  BUT, if your primary goal is Google Voice connectivity, then an Obihai device may be the easiest way to accomplish that, since it will directly connect to Google Voice with no intermediaries involved.  You can plug an analog phone directly into it, or you can use it [as a Google Voice™ Gateway for a SIP IP Phone](http://blog.obihai.com/2012/08/use-your-obi202-as-google-voice-gateway.html).  Then you don't have to fool around with PBX software at all.  It's also possible to use an Obihai device as a [gateway to Asterisk](http://tech.iprock.com/?p=6431), should you wish to go that route, although as you know you don't need an Obihai device for that since Asterisk 11 has the ability to connect to Google Voice directly.",™

t5_2qh8c,Catcifer,1380216978,"Context: This is a mock exam essay question paper for Anderson JC. The first picture the question paper that consists of 4 questions for the student to choose from, and write at least 500 characters within a time limit of 1.5 hours. Apart from having a ridiculous story, the amusing part of the written essay is mainly due to how the writer used similar-sounding Chinese characters to pronounce Singlish, so it may not be as amusing after translation. I will mark those Singlish with *italics*.   Since the writer chose question 2, I will translate that question only. My mandarin is not that good either, so it may not be all that accurate.   Read the passage below, and write based on the instructions.   An old madam is living in a 3 room apartment in Bishan. During the day, her children were out working, leaving her at home alone. One afternoon, a man came and knocked on her door, claiming to be from NEA, and asked her to clean up the broken vase by the corridor. The unsuspecting old madam took a broom and a bucket to the corridor to clean up. When she returned, she found her apartment a mess, with $300 gone along with some accessories.   Instruction: Based on the passage above, write an essay from the old madam's point of view. The essay must capture the feelings of the old madam in her process of getting cheated.    Name: Lin Ming Wei    I am an old madam living in a 3 room apartment in Bishan along with seven children. During the day, they are out playing, so I am home alone, *sibei sian*.   One day, myself and I (yes he wrote that) alone am at home watching the television. I was halfway through watching The Return of Ultraman when there was a sound of knocking on my door. I went to take a look, and saw a man knocking on the door. I walked over, and asked, ""Is it that you want me to open the door?"". To which he replied, ""yes!"", and hence I opened the door for him.   He walked in, and I then asked, ""Do you want me to clean up the broken flower pots by the corridor?"" ""Yes, that too"" he replied, and so I went.   When I returned, I saw that my $300 in the fish tank, along with some my *Digimon™* cards are missing! As the saying goes, ""everything happens for a reason"", I have always known that there is a ghost in the house!   At that time, I was feeling very *dulan*. The money I had saved from young till now was so that I could buy *X-box360*, but now I have nothing left! *no......*    Suddenly, from my television Ultraman flew out. He asked, ""Why so serious?"" I said, ""There are ghosts in my house. *Boo hoo hoo*."" He said, ""*Mu ha ha ha.*""   I was very angry, and unleashed my *bankai*, throwing out a *shuriken*. Because he had *linken sphere*, my *shuriken* was deflected. After that, he raised his arms and finished me off with his *laguna blade*.   I couldn't stand it anymore, and typed out, ""who's your daddy 999999"". After that, I bought myself back. I rushed towards him, shouting ""AH FA DA"" (not sure what this means), and pwned his head for $300.   Finally, I have $300!  edit: formatting",™

t5_2r6f3,thosethatwere,1380223214,"Simple explanation: (without method)  (p XOR r) XOR (~q IFF ~r)  In Boolean form is  (pr + p + r)(qr + [q+1][r+1]) + (pr + p + r) + (qr + [q+1][r+1]) = x mod 2  Substitute in 0 or 1 for each p,q,r to get each combination (p=q=r=0; p=q=0 r =1; p=0 q=r=1; etc.) and x will be the truth value of the expression (p⊻r)⊻(~q↔~r). (If you don't know what mod 2 is, then just pretend any even number is a 0 and any odd number is a 1).  More in-depth explanation: (with method)  Mod n is a type of modular arithmetic where we take the ring of integers and create a ring (or field, if n is prime) by taking the quotient of Z over nZ, where nZ = {an | a is an integer}. It creates a quotient ring (or field) that basically works like a clock does, as in clocks work mod 12 (or 24, for 24-hour clocks) in that 12 + 1 = 1 (i.e. 1 hour past midday is 1pm), or 12 = 0 for a clock.  Now, how I came up with that equation:  Here are the rules  1) A ^ B = AB mod 2  2) A v B = A + B mod 2  3) A⊻B = AB + A + B mod 2  4) ~A = A + 1 mod 2  5) A↔B = AB + [A + 1][B + 1] mod 2  Substitute in q, p, r, (p⊻r) and (~q↔~r) and (p⊻r)⊻(~q↔~r) into the rules above and you'll get the equation above (unless I've made an algebraic mistake). If you take the time to understand everything in this post, and possibly read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic), logic will become easy.",↔

t5_2ssp3,yodatsracist,1380224518,"Thanks, this explains a lot and is something I'll have to keep in mind for the future.  The sociology undergraduate courses I've TA'ed for have had total book prices of $28.95 to $45.75 new on Amazon (plus delivery, plus tax, but sometimes with much cheaper used options), and the one political science course I TA requires no books.  Since our books aren't assigned in the first few weeks (because we have to go through all the Big Theories™ first), our price sensitive/organized students generally have plenty of time to use our large libraries, our excellent library consortium, and, failing both of those, conventional interlibrary loan (which I see them doing).  Many of the books our students need are put on reserve, but I think it's an electronic request so I was mainly confused about the phrase ""bringing copies over"".  I had never heard of libraries taking professors' extra copies, but I guess that's how it must have worked in the Olden Days.  I was also confused because when I was an undergraduate, a few of the old professors still had us do things like ""Go to the library and read this chapter of this edited volume of which the university has only one copy"", which was the only time I ever saw people stress about a reserve book and which was annoying and antiquated even a decade ago.    Also, as a side note, the universities I've been affiliated with--both private--always provide the blue books for exams, and I assumed that all universities did this.  If kids bring their own blue books from home, can't they just fill them with notes?",™

The Blender Foundation seems to be taking steps towards this, but getting the normals in Blender to behave like they do in other packages requires rewriting of some core stuff as far as I know. Also, during this month Blender has had a separately funded split vertex normals supporting exporter to FBX and OBJ done and currently under testing http://mont29.wordpress.com/ There's also an official FBX importer now which is scheduled for version 2.69 (usable now if you get a build with that included) These are an obvious improvement to pipelines where other programs are used plus the fact that they seem to support custom vertex normals hints at things to come.

For one thing, typography hadn't been invented yet ☺ But, from what I've read, it would be accurate to say that handwriting styles influenced things.  It's more accurate to say that as notes were added, the names of the notes split into two camps: the ""B/H"" camp, and the ""B♭/B♮"" camp. I personally feel like the latter makes more sense, but then, I was raised learning that one.  Researching this has made me realize that the whole system of assigning letter names to notes leaves something to be desired: coming up with new symbols would have been less ambiguous. I have a new appreciation for movable do solfège (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti)!",☺

t5_2qmlu,MisterEggs,1380244042,"Indeed.  ""*Most studies regarding synthetic nicotine were conducted in the 60's and 70's by tobacco companies looking for a way to add nicotine on the manufacturing level instead of on the agricultural or botany level. Purely synthetic nicotine is made with a combination of Niacin, Ethanol, Sulfuric Acid and a few other nasty chemicals. When adjusted for inflation, the cost of the process is prohibitively expensive when compared to modern extraction methods. Additionally, we've never seen research indicating a feasible pharmaceutical grade product - industrial grades only. While modern technology may allow for additional resolution steps, we believe the cost has kept it from being seriously pursued. That combination of high cost and more importantly low quality makes it a presently unacceptable option for Johnson Creek.*   *While additional research may have been done, we've never seen published works stating so. To our knowledge, there is currently no firm offering a synthetic pharmaceutical grade nicotine.*    *Extracted nicotine, regardless of plant origin, processed to pharma grades, is technically not synthetic. This pharma or ""pure"" nicotine is used in our products. Other pharma forms of nicotine, such as nicotine polacrilex, undergo a similar process but undergo specific bonding for use in products like nicotine gum, etc.*""""  -Christian Berkey Chairman &amp; CEO Johnson Creek® Enterprises, Inc.",®

So use whatever version of rails/ruby/gems they say to use.   Then when you've done the whole book and feel comfortable go through the book again and change the bits you want. You'll have a better understanding of what you're changing then and how it should affect what you're building.  This really works for me as a way of learning and means you don't end up getting frustrated at things that are different between the 3.2 and 4 version of Rails.    Heroku is a great place to upload apps to so hosting shouldn't be a problem.   That's just my advise though so do what works for you in the end. Thanks again for setting this up. 😊 ",😊

Are your people demanding basic civil liberties and legal rights?  Can't stop the impending tide of popular upheaval against your heavy-handed regime?  Then you should try ***Blaming America™***.  ***  Hi there, CargoCulture here with ***Blaming America™***. In the next two minutes I'm going to demonstrate to you just how effective blaming all your domestic problems on a foreign country that has nothing to do with you can be. Let's start with the process:  What makes ***Blaming America™*** different than other products is that it is just *so easy* to use. Here's how it works:  1.   Have peaceful protests sprout up asking you to leave power  2.   Shoot at the protesters  3.   Use tanks against protesters  4.  Bombard civilian population centers with artillery  5.   Bombard civilian population centers with your air force  6.  Have civil war erupt  7.  Import friendly foreign terrorists from Lebanon  8.  Accuse the other side of using foreign terrorists  9.  Use your huge stockpile of Sarin gas against civilian population centers  10.  Now you are ready to start ***Blaming America™***      You see, America is such a prominent entity in the world community that *any autocratic dictator* from *any crumbling nation-state* can ***Blame America™*** for all their domestic upheaval. All this for the low, low price of buying all your weapons and armaments from a failed pseudo-democratic nation-state that still believes it is relevant and influential.  Act now, and we'll also throw in a free trial of ***[Blaming NesCafe™](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/24/us-libya-protests-gaddafi-idUSTRE71N4NI20110224)***. Read some recent reviews:  &gt; I tried out ***Blaming NesCafe™*** to try and subdue my nation-state's domestic upheaval, and it worked wonders!  &gt; -Muammar G.  Yes, all this and more can be yours for the low, low price of allying with and buying materiel support from a friendly failed pseudo-democratic nation-state where minorities are brutally repressed for no other reason than being minorities!  You deserve better than the miscreants below you know, so don't allow yourself to get topppled! Try ***Blaming America™*** today!  ***  ^^This ^^Message ^^brought ^^to ^^you ^^by ^^the ^^FSB",™

That's ok, though, because it's not necessary to understand ourselves as we understand the world around us if we simply accept who we are, warts and all.  Think of it like this: we see things so well because of our disconnect from ourselves.  It's much easier to see another's perspective if your own perspective is completely unseen by you.  One thing that has helped me to understand myself better was to keep a journal.  Being completely undisciplined, it wasn't every night, but if I skipped a couple of nights, I wrote about them when I did write.  In processing my life as a story to be written down, I saw myself as a character who could be analyzed, to a degree, and I came to understand who I was... somewhat.  The problem with this is then I'd get in a relationship, and stop keeping the journal, and that's kind've when I needed it most; to help me understand the relationships I was in so I could steer clear of problem areas.

It is a good thing that players that aren't leveling zerg when he comes up because it goes faster. And killing him does not reset the chain, succeeding the defend event after him does. If you leave that defend event alone, it takes about 10 minutes to start the chain over. With enough players, just long enough to nab the spider or giant champ if they are up.

t5_2qh41,babygblue,1380291411,"My boyfriends sister was recently in Budapest, so here is the small guide I sent her.    Buda Castle- it takes a good day to wander around in and the view from up there is delightful. And there is the Marzipan museum there 😃 House of terror -was used by Nazi's and the communists. It has a long and horrible past, but is definitely something that needs to be seen. Hosok Tere- 'Heroes Square', it's a big beautiful monument and is surrounded by galleries and backed by a park.  Szechenyi baths - it's beautiful and lovely to have a float around in. There are some pools and baths.  Great Market Hall - a huge market, that has food, crafts and clothing. (I had Langos here from a stall on the upper levels. I'm not sure if its still there) Opera house - you can buy tickets to see an opera for just a few hundred forints (&lt;$5)  Budapest is pretty flat and easy to wander around in. It has some beautiful architecture. You can see some pretty interesting things by just wandering around.    Things to eat Kürtőskalács- bread twisted around a hot rod and baked then dipped in cinnamon and sugar Langos - fried bread with different toppings. It's delicious but very greasy.  Chicken paprikas - chicken cooked in paprika and sour cream Guylas -Goulash  Fruit soup - it sounds strange, but it's actually really yummy Hungary is full of hot springs and mineral water is readily available. Just be careful when you purchase water because otherwise you'll get quite the surprise when your water starts fizzing at you. They have different colour caps and labels, if I remember correctly, pink is mineral, blue is spring.   Drink some palinka. It's a shot, it is delicious and will blow your socks off.    Budapest is right up there with my favourite cities. And if you get a chance to do day trips to any other towns, do it! There are some lovely places in Hungary. (I recommend Eger.) ",😃

A colony ship full of genetically enhanced posthumans reaches its destination only to discover that the planet is populated by batlike people at a primitive stage of technology just short of an electronic age. After millennia of expansion throughout the galaxy without having encountered another intelligent race, humans had come to think it impossible; for their part, the bat people have always thought that space aliens could exist only in engineering tales. The novel unfolds over several years through the alternating stories of two young people: Alternate Discourse Gale, a feisty posthuman on the ship as she leaves home to join her teen cohort of colonizers (Learning the World is the title of her blog); and Darvin, a graduate bat-student in the Impractical Science of astronomy, who discovers the colony ship while mapping the heavens from a mountaintop on his planet. The story moves rapidly, with many twists and surprises. Through action and character, the author masterfully creates an authentic sense of both alien worlds in all their complexity. Of the far-future humans and the bat people, the latter are closer to humans as we are now, and the interplay of the two worlds, each with its numerous cultural and political rivalries, is engaging, rich in social commentary, and often moving, yet also playful and often humorous. Thought-provoking and entertaining, this highly original first-contact story should please any science fiction reader. Christine C.

t5_2snxj,UnoriginalPenguin,1380296515,"Dammit. I actually had almost this exact idea for an app.   It would've been called ""Plate-Rate"". People could snap a picture of your license plate or write it down, and then review your driving performance on whether you cut them off, sped up like a dickface, or were very pleasant and let you in their lane. You could register your plate on our website, and see your reviews, and connect with other plates. Then I figured if it became popular enough, I would sell the whole thing to some company like carfax or some shit, and make millions.  The only problem was that it would encourage people to use their phones while driving, and I wasn't sure about the legality of a database of license plates. Also, I have no idea how to build an app.   I still think it's a cool idea though.  Plate-Rate™",™

Bradley moves his ScootSuit™ forward, its neural interface linked into his cerebral cortex, closing his eyes and relaxing as the sun's warmth begins to bathe his face in its light.  Although dolphins have finally developed opposable thumbs, living away from their aquatic home has never appealed. Bradley is among those who've compromised by carrying some of the sea with them in a mobile exoskeleton which allows for complete range of motion.  ""Bradley, come in?"" His partner, Jared, a humpback whale, send a quantum-tunneled thoughtburst through the neural interlink they share. ""I hear you, go ahead,"" Jared replied.  ""Plankton galore down here, old chap, I shall be here a very many hours. What news on the surface?""  ""Not much, love,"" Bradley began, ""Sun, sea, and nanites."" He looked across the vast plain, which waved like the grassy plants of the old savannah, but were instead metallic, absorbing the sun's rays, converting it to usable energy, and making blindingly fast micro-adjustments in response to wind and clouds.   Bradley couldn't wait to sink his unit into Jared's blowhole, but realized in the meantime he should do something to stave off his amorous thoughts.   ""I hear what you're thinking, chum!"" Jared teased. ""Just you wait! We'll go down on each other in short order.""

t5_2qh03,justagirl90210,1380311328,"Those people were right. Steam is shit. It's always been a horrible idea.  The problem with all online DRM systems/stores is that they're only good when someone has a monopoly. Even when they have a virtual monopoly like Steam, they still suck despite their convenience, because you don't really own any of your games anymore, and your access to them can be yanked at any moment. Fucking thing sucks.  Before Steam had a monopoly, it completely fucking sucked, because you had to login to some shitty DRM system just to play Half-Life 2. After basically everything was on it, it was convenient for people because it was the only place you had to go, people gave in, and just accepted that it was always there and would auto start when you booted your OS. Essentially, Valve won.  One of the major reasons people still hate Origin (after they fixed their technical issues) is that it's ANOTHER piece of shit you have to log into on top of Steam. They don't have a monopoly, so you're stuck with multiple accounts, multiple passwords, and multiple bullshit. Companies are greedy, of course, and they all want a slice of the pie that Gaben is getting fat on, so they keep coming up with their own shitty online DRM stores, but Steam got there first, so it's going to be very hard for a competitor to beat it. See, that's the evil brilliance of Steam. People are INVESTED in it now. They have 50 games already. It's like fucking Pokemon collecting. They won't want to give up their collection for a competing product (even if it's better), so Valve basically has a stranglehold on you. People have way too many eggs in one fat basket.  All these online DRM systems are bullshit. Should Valve have a near monopoly on internet game distribution, and if they didn't have a near monopoly, would their service be attractive? No and no.  Just ask yourself this question: would you be happy if every major game developer had its own Steam-like online DRM system, and you needed separate accounts and separate client software installations with separate EULAs and separate bullfuck? Of course you wouldn't. That's WHY you hate uPlay, WHY you hate Origin, and WHY you'll hate any other competition. Do NOT be disingenuous and tell me that you hate uPlay and Origin because Ubi Soft and EA are evil and they suck, because even if they fixed every technical issue and nitpick, you'd STILL hate them because it's ANOTHER account, ANOTHER DRM, and MORE bullshit that you have to deal with ON TOP of Steam, which you're already stuck with because they've cornered most of the market.  This model DOES NOT WORK when it isn't monopolized and you have to deal with multiple companies. That's why it sucks, why it's evil, and why we're all a bunch of idiots for letting Valve use HL2 as a Trojan horse for this dogshit in the first place. That's all HL2 was, by the way. It wasn't a game. It was a Trojan horse for this--where the real money from the movie is made.™  You see where this is all going, right? First they lock down the distribution of games. Now with their console and controller they're going to try to lock down the games themselves so that they'll SUCK if they're not played within the context of Steam. They're trying to eliminate the viability of all their competitors by getting developers to tie in their games to this controller, which will, of course, be seamlessly integrated with Steam and be clunky/feel like shit without it.  The truth is that all of these game companies should have followed GOG's model: someone buys a game online, and they get to download a DRM-free copy of it to their local machine with NO STRINGS ATTACHED, and if you want to, you can download it again from them. That IS the best model for consumers. I repeat: NO STRINGS ATTACHED. NO INVESTMENT. NO COMMITMENT. No feeling that you ""have"" to stick with Steam because you already have 100 games on it.  Fucking Steam sucks.",™

I've put an absurd amount of time into improving Trainsawlaser, and I hope you guys have as much fun on it as we have testing it.  Full Changelog:  - Over 12 minutes of new voice dialogue added. - Added sacrifice milestone events. Every 100 kills on the counter will trigger a random event. The KoTH timers pause for these events. - Choo Choo the Trainshark, Lucy in the Sky With Lasers, and Pastor Kilgore have been crafted to serve as minions of the one true Train God. They can be summoned by amassing a worthy amount of sacrifices.  - Tiny Train Rain™ sacrifice event added. - Uber Train sacrifice event added. - Increased the random timer range slightly for the spawn courtyard trains. (Now it's between 10 seconds and 25, before it was 7 to 22.) - Blocked Red's detail area behind the laser wall. - Placed building blocking brushes around all hazards to prevent griefing. - Added detail to the floor of the center area to justify the building blocking brushes also placed over the area. Suck it, Engineers. - Added front railing to sniper balconies... Also lasers. - Standardized hazard damage to balance higher-HP game modes (Saxton Hale, etc) Falling trains deal 5000 damage, crossing trains 2500, saws/ normal lasers/ sharks 1000, spawn laser 10000, roof acid does 30 per tick, side pit acid 10 per tick. - Refined fucks given counter tracking system. This should now be much more accurate. - Optimized particle usage in spontaneous combustion room. - Added drop-down under back-and-forth laser, going to the water. - Widened center laser's arc. - Tweaked Train Rain™ pathing to prevent it from staying in the sky when inactive. Not sure where this bug came from, but it's theoretically fixed now. - Further detailing around the map (Let me know if anyone has any framerate issues). - Bumped up the chance of getting an uber charge from the spawn room uber lasers by 200%. - 3d Skybox added. - Easter eggs! Look for them, bitch! - Added random-timed flame bursts next to control point, embedded in the ground. Random time between 30-45 seconds with a 5 second warning pilot light before a 4 second burst of flames that ignites players. - Added 7 new pumpkin-bombs. - Started optimization of lightmaps. (Decreases file size so I can cram more crap in) - Opened a couple roof areas up so you can jump over them. You are pushed off if you try to stand on them, however. Sometimes into saws. - Raised the minimum and maximum random time range for the center electricty hazard by 15 seconds each. - Removed a key strike location for the center electricity hazard. - Slightly widened the player clip on the horizontal saws to make it easier to grab the small health pack. - Removed moving saws on top of first buildings coming out of spawn. Not worth the cost. - Passing trains now have slight chance to go backwards. - Slightly moved two trains of the Train Rain™ to fix a bug where you could be killed in a safe area underwater.  There is a lot going into this version, so there *may* be issues that could pop up.  If anyone notices any, let me know immediately and I'll see if I can take care of them.  I'll be around for awhile to answer anyone's questions if they have any.  :)  [I started a Steam group for those interested in keeping up with the map](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Trainsawlaser)",™

Remember, if you come out of ketosis you will have a much stronger hunger than normal. This is what so often leads to unintended binges. So be wary. You are doing really well. I spent a couple years getting off track in just this way; it wasn't till I refused to eat differently that I finally lost the weight. Btw, I know if I stick to things like steak and salads w/oil dressing, I'll be fine, so in that way I don't have track on trips. Just trying to help.😊",😊

t5_2u06v,bunny1979,1380318952,"Put bluntly, I side with your husband on this one, but I would give your mom the chance to change.  If she doesn't, than it's time to say goodbye.  While I was pregnant, I had  a fall-out with my parents.  I ended up writing them a letter so I could be ""to the point"" and not overly emotional.  Since then, I've noticed a huge change in my father (he was the problem), and I suspect that threatening to hold off on visits made my mom furious with him, and she may have put him in his place.    I suggest you write a letter, but the first one is one you don't send, put ALL your emotions out on the table.  The second one is edited with points and some emotion.  The 3rd one is the one you send, but make it ""to the point"", and cut out the emotion.  It really is a chance for her to see what she's doing to you and potentially passing down to your daughter down the line.  My husband read and re-read my letter, so get your husband involved.  I really hope you can work things out, but if you can't, just see that your mom is toxic, and it's unhealthy to have toxic friends in your life, so why allow toxic family?  Blood isn't always thicker than water.  TRUST ME!!!    Good luck😊 ",😊

I can wait until the middle of November for my appointment with the Cardiologist, since I know when to stop and rest until my bp rises again.

t5_2qpp6,xtfftc,1380322168,"Same here. My first thought was ""They are being cheap"". But they're obviously spending a lot of money on the campaign, so this shouldn't have been that big of an expense compared to the rest.  Then I thought that maybe they did some marketing research and figured out that people are dumb and the story should be dumb to appeal to them. But that's simply not true... Even dumb people like interesting stories.   Just think of some generic action film with lots of special effects and a boring story and compare it to something like The Dark Knight. On its own, The Dark Knight is far from being a masterpiece in term of story. But in the action genre it is streets ahead™ of most others. And do dumb people dislike it because it has a more complicated story and layered characters? No, they absolutely love it.   No one expects a video game such as SC:BW (and War2/War3) to have some amazingly captivating story. But at least it made me care about the characters... I was sad when all the heroes were lost forever behind the portal (only for Blizzard to fuck this up ten years later), I felt the importance of Megnsk's influence, and I was hoping that Illidan would manage to stop Arthas.

t5_2qh1i,Roods,1380324810,"Not me but a friend of mine:  Back in the day I was quite a keen skateboarder and a crew of 4-6 of us would skate from spot to spot in our area finding ledges to grind and sets of stairs to do tricks off.  One evening we snuck into the play area of a local secondary school. We managed to find an empty bin that we tipped over and rolled into the middle of the play area and then proceeded do a few tricks over it. We started off with doing ollies, then kickflips and all manner of other X-treme™ tricks.  So a friend of hours, whom we imaginatively named American Jake, (because he was American and was called Jake), decided he'd go one better and try and 'go big' over the bin. He managed to completely misjudge the height of the bin causing the skateboard to flip vertically and smash into his dick with a considerable amount of force. Within seconds the crouch of his trousers had turned a dark red. Jake was obviously in a great deal of pain, but thankfully one of us was observant enough to give him the good news in case he wasn't completely aware of the gravity of the situation.   ""Dude, there's blood coming out of your dick man.""  Apparently the board had smacked his manhood with such force that it reptured his urethrea and cause him to piss blood at a worrying rate. We ended up having to call an ambulance and Jake's evening of skateboarding ended with him hobbling into an ambulance and having his manhood handled by a male doctor  TL;DR -friend managed to destroy his urethra with his skateboard",™

The Microphone of my [Roccat Kulo](http://www.roccat.org/Products/Gaming-Sound/ROCCAT-Kulo-7-1-USB/) 7.1 Headset recently broke so i looked a bit into this whole Headset / Headphones thingy...    Now im kinda ashamed of my Kulo and want to get real Headphones /a real Headset and possibly also a new Soundcard/DAC + AMP    **Budget:** around 100€(not more than 150€) = 135USD (max 200USD) + maybe 50€/70$ DAC/AMP    **Usage:** Counter Strike, i play a lot of CS 1.6 as well as GO and the sound is a very important aspect to the game Source: my gaming-home-pc(Realtek® ALC 892 8CH HDaudio); Google galaxy nexus maguro(soon the nexus 5); Lenovo Thinkpad X201t      **Past Headphones:** My first Headset was a noname shitty thing, i dont even want to remember, urgghhh after that i got the Roccat Kulo which is or was at the time so damn awesome compared to my shitty old Headset. Though my current Setup is ... hm probably the worst you can do: Kulo is via the 7.1 USB dongle plugged in and i'm controlling it via the Razer Surround... its horrible. The sound itself is OK... besides the background noise the overpowerd bass. If i plug it directly into my headphone-jack its ways to quiet so i have to turn up the volume which adds too much noise... (currently -15dB in Roccat driver &amp; 50% in windows) Moreover the bass hits so hard i can barely hear anything above all the shooting in CS...    **Prefered Type:** I am not entirely sure here but i think the Kulo is ""Open, on the ears"" it fits really well, doesnt fall off etc; I dont really need noice insulation actually it would be helpful if i could still hear something of my environment (cat&amp;parents...)    * If the Headphone does not have a microphone maybe a seperate affordable mic would be a solution (?) * Is my Razer-Surround virtual 7.1 + Realtek HD workaround a good idea or should i invest into a seperate Soundcard? (DAC/AMP/7.1thingy)    Thanks again for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to the suggestions!  *meh, as you probably noticed, english is not my first language... i'm still learning it so i appreciate every language/grammer based :)* criticism/tips :)",®

t5_2ssl0,JRDerpwing,1380368820,"**UPDATED AGAIN!**  Oh man you're in luck; there are TONs of anime and manga that are made for girls and focus on female characters! There's the ""[shoujo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shōjo_manga)"" genre, of course, but there's also lots of series in other genres with female leads:  * Anything by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki.  * ♥ [**Eureka seveN**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/237/Eureka_Seven). Sci-fi, action, mecha, and my waifu.  * ♥ [**Zero no Tsukaima**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima) has a nice balance of action, romance and comedy, and my waifu.  * ♥ [**Kaiba**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba).  It's stretching the definition of gender quite a bit but you'll see. ;) Avoid any spoilers. Seriously this anime is just epic.  * ★ [**Shingeki no Kyojin**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) AKA **Attack on Titan**. This is the hottest show right now. Not quite the main character but a strong female supporting character nonetheless.  * ★ [**Last Exile**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/97/Last_Exile) and even more so, [**Last Exile ~Gin'yoku no Fam~**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10336/Last_Exile:_Ginyoku_no_Fam) (Fam of the Silver Wings) the sequel, where almost every major character is female. Lots of great action sequences, kickass characters and an awesome steampunk universe with an epic story (I'm talking the first one, not so much in the second, IMO.)  * ★ [**Claymore**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1818/Claymore). This is a badass show with a dark setting and lots of action and gore.  * ★ [**Basilisk**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/67/Basilisk:_Kouga_Ninpou_Chou). Ninja romance with lots of kickass action and gore.  * [**Saiunkoku Monogatari**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/957/Saiunkoku_Monogatari). Set in a fictional country that's like a mix of ancient imperial Japan and China, this decidedly shoujo series focuses on a girl that becomes the concubine of a fail emperor in order to reform him and then runs for a governmental office. Has some elements of fantasy and a little action here and there, but mostly it's political intrigue and stuff and some reverse-harem romance. Great music.  * [**Fractale**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9314/Fractale). Sci-fi.  * [**Dennou Coil**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil). Sci-fi.  * [**Haibane Renmei**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei). This is a slice-of-life with a MAJOR twist. Avoid spoilers!  * [**Miyori no Mori**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2751/Miyori_no_Mori). Movie about a cynical girl who moves to the countryside and meets spirits in the nearby forest, with some environmentalist themes IIRC. Reminds me of Miyazaki's Mononoke in that way.  * [**Kamichu!**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/489/Kamichu!) This is real cute. The slice-of-life of a little girl who becomes a god in the Japanese pantheon.  * [**Mokke**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2931/Mokke). Two sisters with the ability to see and interact with spirits from Japanese folklore.  * [**Aria**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation) AKA Aqua. Slice-of-life of a gondola er..operator and her fellow apprentices on a Venice-like Mars. Perfect for lazy afternoons.  * [**Cross Game**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game). Baseball and romance. Not your typical sports anime (not that I've seen many.) Starts with some major feels right in the very first episode.  * [SPOILER](/s ""Kino no Tabi AKA Kino's Journey"") Yes, it's a spoiler that the main character is a girl. :(  I know you asked for action and adventure but I threw in some shows that are primarily slice-of-life and comedy because their premise is pretty unique (e.g. Venice-on-Mars) enough to warrant a viewing.",♥

Despite half a century of research there is still no evidence that natural saturated fat (like meat, butter, eggs etc.) is anything but completely safe to eat.  Have a look at these recent reviews of all the evidence:   &gt;Insufficient evidence of association is present for intake of … saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids; total fat … meat, eggs and milk. [Mente A, et al. A systematic review of the evidence supporting a causal link between dietary factors and coronary heart disease.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011 Jul 6;(7):CD002137.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD002137/frame.html)   &gt;…no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD. [Siri-Tarino PW, et al. Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies evaluating the association of saturated fat with cardiovascular disease. Am J Clin Nutr. 2010 Mar;91(3):535-46.](http://www.ajcn.org/content/91/3/535.long)    &gt;The observational evidence does not support the hypothesis that dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods contribute to obesity or cardiometabolic risk… [Kratz M, et al.

European Journal of Nutrition, Online First™, 18 July 2012](http://www.springerlink.com/content/1665l525j917h055/?MUD=MP)   This means that the scientific foundation of the low fat dietary advice has fallen.

t5_2qh3p,pendorbound,1380396758,"It's unlikely you could tie a rope tight enough to actually prevent you from having an orgasm.  For that, it would have to be either so tight as to be excruciatingly painful (thus preventing you from cumming cause it hurt too much to concentrate, unless you like that sort of thing) or so tight as to make everything numb so that you couldn't feel enough to orgasm.  Either of those would be a BadThing™, but I doubt you're talking about quite that tight.  It's more likely that you could be tied so tight that it would prevent semen from escaping your body when you did orgasm, instead forcing the semen back down into your bladder.  That's a retrograde ejaculation.  That's not going to kill you or make your cock fall off, but it's not really great for you either.    There are a few risks from (frequent) retrograde ejaculation:  1) It may cause your body to develop an autoimmune response to your own sperm, possibly rendering you sterile.  This is rare.  I've never heard of a case personally, but some people consider it a possibility if retrograde ejaculation happens frequently.  2) If the rope wasn't at the base of your penis (further down the shaft) and semen entered your penis before it was blocked, it can cause damage to your urethra -- too much pressure.  Odds of this happening from one time aren't high, but it's possible.  This also probably won't kill you, but it might make it hurt like a mother the next time you piss, and there might be some blood.  Probably something you'd prefer to avoid...  3) It might cause some stress or damage to your prostate as you're basically causing way more pressure down there than the plumbing is intended to handle and also forcing it back down the wrong direction.  Again, you're probably not going to burst or get prostate cancer from doing this once in a while, but doing it often isn't a great idea.  Now...  Knowing all these things, you might want to try really hard not to cum when you're tied up that tight.  And of course you'd have the Father of All Erections from all the extra blood trapped in your penis, so you'd really want to cum.  But cumming might hurt or be bad for you, and your partner might be egging you on even more to try and ""force"" you.  Mind fucks are great, IMHO... =)",™

At the start of each game session you play a new character, a descendant of your starting character’s bloodline.  &gt; In RED AEGIS your character abilities are not tied to the individual hero you are playing.

I was called creepy when I was younger. I was just as pretty as I am now. Maybe prettier. I had a six pack, and I was in a band. I also wore a fedora and whined about how I was a Nice Guy™ always being put in the Friend Zone™. I thought shock humor and rape jokes and all that were the pinnacle of humor. I thought never filtering my thoughts or exercising tact was proof that I was edgy, honest, brash. And as much as I didn't mean to be, I was fucking creepy. The things I said to girls I liked, the fact that I kept trying with girls who were clearly not into me, the fact that so much of my confidence was clearly bullshit. The words, the fucking words that came out of my mouth and through my keyboard. I'm surprised I wasn't called a creep more often in those days, real talk.  Even now, being gorgeous but not a creep, not all women find me attractive, and not all the ones that do would like me if they spoke to me. And that's okay. But I never get called creepy by them because I know when to move, when to back off, when to keep going, and when to let it go. I know when to speak and when to keep my stupid mouth shut. I only say what I mean, so I only say it if there's a way to say it without being creepy. If there isn't, it can be saved until she knows me better or just thrown out entirely. I don't have to verbalize every insignificant thought that flits by across my mind.  Learn not to be a creep and suddenly sexual harassment complaints are not even a thing you think about, let alone worry about.",™

Voters love it.  2. Pick the most fringe opinion and make it your platform. Defunding public education? Rock on. Have investments in private prisons? Three strikes is too easy, more like one strike, amiright? Have connections to Hollywood? Lobby endlessly for asinine copyright restrictions that no citizens actually want or understand.  3. Call the other side unpatriotic. Voters love pissing matches over things like flag pins. Schedule tours into active combat zones for photo ops.  4. The only issue voters care about is naming post offices for large donors in your district. Make sure these votes come up regularly. It shows your constituents that you care A Lot™.  5.

t5_2cneq,Soltheron,1380440397,"&gt; So, without the United States and it's terrible, terrible healthcare system...  Do you ever stop spouting nonsense? Go take a look at just how much good stuff is coming out of the UK alone.  It's also a complete fallacy to imply that the US system being terrible is a requirement for everyone else to have lower costs. That you guys suck at setting up systems for yourselves helps the rich and hurts you, but it is not a requirement for the rest of the world to have lower prices.  &gt; healthcare is magically cheaper when the government pays for it  It's not ""magically"" cheaper, it's just cheaper. You take the profit motive out of necessary things and prices go down. When you have a necessary thing you can price gouge as much as you want if there are no regulations against that; people *need* that thing to survive, after all. This really is quite simple to understand for everyone else.  It's also not something we need to theorize about because you can clearly see that universal healthcare is cheaper across the globe than that bloated, corrupt mess in the US.  &gt;""...except when it's not such a good thing...""  Your absolutism is showing again. I guess if you understood nuance even a little bit you wouldn't be a pants-on-head libertarian.  &gt; If you think that universal systems are immune to this, you're in for a rude awakening  Your scaremongering garbage doesn't really work when you and your other clueless buddies have the absolute fucking worst track record of predictions. When is that inflation going to doom us all, again? Oh, right, years ago.  &gt;are the pharmaceutical's that made it possible getting justly paid?  Oh boo hoo, poor big pharma. :(  Once the world wakes up and skips the middle man when socializing health care research, many of the current problems will vanish into thin air.  &gt;It turns out that humans are generally cooperative, empathetic, and altruistic by and large  We are indeed an empathic civilization, which is why most people have no problems whatsoever with paying for social safety nets. Selfish turds who don't acknowledge their social responsibility, however, don't get to reap the benefits of society without paying for themselves. Sorry, you don't get to mooch off of established society. Go set up your libertopia somewhere else if you don't like it. The Minerva Reefs seems like a good spot...oh, wait, you already tried that...and you failed to protect your territory. But it's okay, in *actual* libertopia everyone will defend themselves from the mafia for reals!  &gt; competitive incentive  Yeah, this is what I'm talking about when I say you're completely, 100% clueless when it comes to human psychology. [Here, educate yourself a bit about what motivates us.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)  &gt; No private organization has committed violence that anywhere near approaches the scale of violence, death, and destruction wrought by governments.  Yeah, the East India Company is just a figment of everyone's imagination, and they certainly didn't have private armies. It's not like we have historical precedent for the mafia and warlords picking up the slack whenever governments disappear.  &gt;What incentive would anyone have to use a nuclear weapon?  Oh Christ on a tricycle so you are just as fucking deluded. PEOPLE. AREN'T. RATIONAL.  You can bitch and moan about your NAP as much as you want when someone just dirty bombed a stadium because they thought it would bring them closer to Xenu or because some rich nutjob really hated the football teams; it won't change shit of what just happened.  &gt;Sure, we're not all perfectly rational agents -- but aggregately, we more or less are.  No, not really. [We are not](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14q28r/if_there_is_one_thing_from_your_profession_that/c7fgl4t) very [rational](http://bookoutlines.pbworks.com/w/page/14422685/Predictably%20Irrational), and we are manipulated extremely easily, as you can see by the results of politics in a lot of countries today, not to mention the wars you were complaining about.  As much as libertarians love to go on about STEM and logic™, you're also [not a very rational bunch.](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/04/21/study-finds-belief-in-free-market-economics-predicts-rejection-of-science/) That's no surprise, though, as it goes with the territory to reject science when you believe in Austrian ~~economics~~ philosophy.  &gt;Right, because there have been so many Libertarian societies, um, ever.   Yes, and you people never seem to actually take a lesson from that. There hasn't really been one because whenever a society approaches that, it fucks itself up:  *****  The libertarianism that has any effect in the world, then, has nothing to do with social liberty, and everything to do with removing all restrictions on business. So what's wrong with that?  Let's look at some cases that came within spitting distance of the libertarian ideal. **Some libertarians won't like these, because they are not Spotless Instances of the Free Utopia; but as I've said, nothing is proved by science fiction. If complete economic freedom and absence of government is a cure-all, partial economic freedom and limited government should be a cure-some.**  **Pre-New Deal America**  At the turn of the 20th century, business could do what it wanted-- and it did. The result was robber barons, monopolistic gouging, management thugs attacking union organizers, filth in our food, a punishing business cycle, slavery and racial oppression, starvation among the elderly, gunboat diplomacy in support of business interests.  The New Deal itself was a response to crisis (though by no means an unprecedented one; it wasn't much worse than the Gilded Age depressions). A quarter of the population was out of work. Five thousand banks failed, destroying the savings of 9 million families. Steel plants were operating at 12% capacity. Banks foreclosed on a quarter of Mississippi's land. Wall Street was discredited by insider trading and collusion with banks at the expense of investors. Farmers were breaking out into open revolt; miners and jobless city workers were rioting.  Don't think, by the way, that if governments don't provide gunboats, no one else will. Corporations will build their own military if necessary: the East Indies Company did; Leopold did in the Congo; management did when fighting with labor.  **Post-communist Russia**  Or take Russia in the decade after the fall of Communism, as advised by free-market absolutists like Jeffrey Sachs. Russian GDP declined 50% in five years. The elite grabbed the assets they could and shuffled them out of Russia so fast that IMF loans couldn't compensate. In 1994 alone, 600 businessmen, journalists, and politicians were murdered by gangsters. Russia lacked a working road system, a banking system, anti-monopoly regulation, effective law enforcement, or any sort of safety net for the elderly and the jobless. Inflation reached 2250% in 1992. Central government authority effectively disappeared in many regions.  By the way, Russia is the answer to those testosterone-poisoned folks who think that guns will prevent oppression. The mafia will always outgun you.  Today's Russia is moving back toward authoritarianism under Putin. Again, this should dismay libertarians: apparently, given a little freedom, many people will demand less. You'd better be careful about setting up that utopia; ten years further on it may be taken over by authoritarians.  **Pinochet's Chile**  Or consider the darling of many an '80s conservative: Pinochet's Chile, installed by Nixon, praised by Jeanne Kirkpatrick, George Bush, and Paul Johnson. In twenty years, foreign debt quadrupled, natural resources were wasted, universal health care was abandoned (leading to epidemics of typhoid fever and hepatitis), unions were outlawed, military spending rose (for what? who the hell is going to attack Chile?), social security was ""privatized"" (with predictable results: ever-increasing government bailouts) and the poverty rate doubled, from 20% to 41%. Chile's growth rate from 1974 to 1982 was 1.5%; the Latin American average was 4.3%.  Pinochet was a dicator, of course, which makes some libertarians feel that they have nothing to learn here. Somehow Chile's experience (say) privatizing social security can tell us nothing about privatizing social security here, because Pinochet was a dictator. Presumably if you set up a business in Chile, the laws of supply and demand and perhaps those of gravity wouldn't apply, because Pinochet was a dictator.  When it's convenient, libertarians even trumpet their association with Chile's ""free market"" policies; self-gov.org (originators of that cute quiz) includes a page celebrating Milton Friedman, self-proclaimed libertarian, who helped form and advise the group of University of Chicago professors and graduates who implemented Pinochet's policies. The Cato Institute even named a prize for ""Advancing Liberty"" after this benefactor of the Chilean dictatorship.  The newest testing ground for laissez-faire is **present-day America**, from Ronald Reagan on.  Remove the New Deal, and the pre-New Deal evils clamor to return. Reagan removed the right to strike; companies now fire strikers, outsource high-wage jobs and replace them with dead-end near-minimum-wage service jobs. Middle-class wages are stagnating-- or plummeting, if you consider that working hours are rising. Companies are rushing to reestablish child labor in the Third World.   *****  http://www.zompist.com/libertos.html  As for how the markets were never pure enough, go back up and re-read the bolded part, then [read this.](http://unlearningeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/the-fantasy-of-a-pure-market/)  But, alas, instead of actually trying to learn anything from this this is the part where you try your hand at good ol' historical revisionism. Be sure to link to mises.org fantasies in your reply, or I'll have to question your libertarian street cred.  ",™

He used to sing the praises of some of the most dispicable dictators alive, in the hope of swaying them towards implementing TM, as well as practicing it themselves.  Basically, he was hoping to replay [the history of Mozambique and TM](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201212/can-meditation-change-the-world).  And of course, history may BE repeating itself in Brazil, but in an even bigger way: Dilma Rousseff, President of Brazil, is a TMer and it was recently announced that the Brazilian government has embraced TM for practice in the public schools and is setting aside money to train 48,000 TM teachers -one for each public school in Brazil- which should be sufficient to train all 45,000,000 Brazilian school age kids to meditate over the next 10 years.  If that project actually happens, will you accept that using celebreties to endorse meditation has an upside for the entire world?",™

Just because you don't like that future doesn't make it an appeal to emotion. No the logic fallacy is yours. You don't like the negative prediction so you call it an appeal to emotion, and then when I call you on it, it becomes a strawman based on your own circular logic.   Ok. Ok. You know that there are these things called...climate models, and they make predictions so I'm not sure what your point is with your talk about equations. You do realize that you didn't make a point besides...nah you really didn't make a point.  Now my point with the whole Real Big Fat Stupid Thing To Do™ is that there are some things that are stupidly self evident that should not be done. Now hold up. I can already sense you tensing up. You're about to pull out one of those catchall ""emotional argument"" attacks that really doesn't apply but apparently you've have success using previously so it is your goto defense.  You see there is this thing called entropy. What that means is that when you mess with something without having a plan, far more often than not things get worse not better. It is just a fact of the universe that there are far far fewer organized nice ways for things to happen then messed up unorganized ways. As an experiment you can do at home, take a nice ordered deck of cards. Now mess with them by throwing them across the room. Keep doing that until you beat that entropy thing by having the cards remain ordered. Be patient. It's going to be a while.  So anyways back to those big old water holes that we call oceans. They are kind of important. I tried to emphasize that point by noting that they make 50% of our oxygen. Oh they do a lot more than that, but I assumed that would be enough to qualify for the term important.  Ok so we got these important ocean things going on and along comes that acidification thing to mess with them. Now from our prior talk about entropy, what do you think the odds are that the acidification isn't a Real Big Fat Stupid Thing To Do™. ",™

And the wording of that rule is against posting looking for a game to play in, not against looking for game recommendations.  Have you looked at the original Call of Cthulhu (BRP system) as well?  It's a fairly unanimous opinion that the d20 system is nowhere nearly as good for CoC as the original.  Also, a few fun ones to add to the list:  Amber Diceless- you play immortal scheming Lords and Ladies of All Reality™ who can buy personalized universes for a single character point and your biggest threat is probably your aunt who you insulted over dinner a century ago.   Truth and Justice- A superhero RPG where you don't have hitpoints, but instead to damage directly to the traits on your character sheet.  Hit upside the head?  Well, you're a little addled and your Accounting skill is reduced for now.  Not that big a deal midcombat, but it may come back to haunt you later if that means you make a slip in the bookkeeping at your secret identity's dayjob.  A Dirty World- A Film Noir RPG with a different, and dynamic system for handling social conflict and virtue and corruption, as befits the genre it is based on.  I really love it and recommend it if you like Noir at all.  Dogs in the Vineyard- It's another odd game where the central conflict mechanic isn't based on direct damage, but how far you will push things to win, and how much damage you'll take in that drive.  The base system has the players as gunslinging Mormonesque paladins in a low fantasy Wild West.  I'll stop here, since you're going to get plenty of suggestions to sort through.

t5_2sek8,fizzlewizzlebizzle,1380492368,"Take a seat, get your popcorn, I'm about to get on the world' largest soapbox.  Don't worry so much about the small stuff man!!! I see a lot of guys asking very specific questions about what to say here or worrying about one awkward sounding thing they said, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter much.  At risk of sounding like a made for TV Lifetime movie, it's about how you say what you say and the feeling behind it. If you're happy, projecting fun, and appear + feel confident, you'll let off good vibes and be attractive.  While texting is great because it allows you to build rapport and sexual tension with girls you don't see, what makes it most interesting is also why I don't like it and refrain from texting girls for the most part. The fact that what you say doesn't just flow out of you, you type it in and have complete control over, causes you to meticulously pick your words to mask your feelings or play off a specific emotion, say things you wouldn't say in real life, or even begin to worry about things such as.... When to use emojis!  Another reason I don't like texting is because you can't easily convey your emotions, because you don't have things such as facial expressions and body language to help you.  Anyways... You're probably wondering... When the hell should I use emojis?  Well, when YOU feel it's necessary, use them. It should be authentic. I'll give you some examples of how I've used them:  One time I was texting a girl, and I just felt like sending a bunch of stupid emojis, so I did. I spent the next half an hour conversing about stupid things in emojis, and the girl really liked it.  That's the only time I can think of I've used it. I have a good example from my friend from last night though.  He asked a girl he had been texting for awhile on a date and she said yes but not until 2 weeks from now because of an AP bio trip, and he responded ""definately ❤️(heart emoji) because he really liked her and cares about her and wanted to show her.  Be authentic. Don't sweat the small stuff. Hope this helped! ",❤

t5_2t7no,damisword,1380504539,"&gt;catchall ""emotional argument"" attacks that really doesn't apply  Fallacies are always fallacies when they are identified correctly. And yours are fallacies.  &gt;You see there is this thing called entropy. What that means is that when you mess with something without having a plan  You have no idea what entropy is. Please study first-year thermodynamics to get a better idea of this esoteric concept. Do not try to be condescending. I am extremely familiar with it. Entropy can be thought of as a measure of heat disorder among other things. It always increases, even when you have a plan. Organising energy in one area will always increase entropy in other areas. Think of a refrigerator freezing ice-cubes. Don't try to use this to justify emotional arguments.  And again you use the  &gt;Real Big Fat Stupid Thing To Do™  argument. Not good. You should try to convince people by giving numbers, predictions of consequences eg. how acidification might affect ocean flora and fauna. Don't just give it a childish label. You demean yourself.  Oh, and cards? Really? Yes there's a statistical chance it might happen. But in real life, cards will never form an ordered pack due to aerodynamic effects disturbing gaps between the cards and not allowing them to even stack. You aren't grounded in reality, I am.    ",™

t5_2qhsj,TwelveBaud,1380523099,"The best solution, obviously, would be to go see the doctor. I get the feeling ""not having time"" is an excuse -- what happened to the time taken up by the sports whose seasons ended? -- and if he drives himself he can visit a doctor while he's otherwise out and about. Only a doctor, and the blood tests they give their professional interpretation on, are definitive.  That said, there are other things he can do. Supermarket pharmacies sell small blood glucose meters for around $15-30, usually with a small set of test strips. Getting a sterile lancet to use to draw blood may be a little more difficult, but looking online I'm seeing 50-packs for around $30 at the very low end. Have him test just before, one hour after, and two hours after a meal. If he's seeing numbers above around 140, then he should definitely go to a doctor or, if not, come talk to us on IRC. (We'll probably make him go to a doctor.)  ""A can of pop a day and at least some fast food"" does not a gravely ill person make. Type 2 diabetes is a situation where the liver is no longer responding to insulin; while diet can certainly play a part, there are also genetic components and other factors. Also, although it's a somewhat late presentation, he could have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition where the body becomes allergic to and destroys the insulin-making cells.Either way, it's a pretty safe bet that, even if he has diabetes, your friend didn't cause it, doesn't deserve it, and it's not his fault.

Also re: the cornies, it's interesting that half their site says 5 gal, but then under the FAQ, they have this question/answer:  **How much beer can Zymatic™ brew in one batch?**  &gt; Zymatic™ can brew up to 2.5 gallons finished beer across a very wide range of brewing systems. This is usually about 3 gallons of wort into the fermenter but depends on the recipe. The limitations are two-fold: grain capacity of the step filter, and water capacity of the keg/fermenter. For a lighter beer, its certainly possible to do a slightly larger batch. For extremely heavy beers you may get less than 2.5 gallons finished beer.",™

Realistically, there were about 4 or 5 home league games that I looked for in the fixture list at the beginning of the season that I arranged my life around, and frankly it was getting to the point where I wasn't really that bothered about the rest - I either sold on, or quite often, just gave my ticket away for the other ones.    However, this season I'm absolutely engrossed and I can't get enough - in the week leading up to West Brom I was on Reddevils every hour, checking rumours of team news, the fallout from the league cup game (normally really not bothered about the Tin Pot Cup, even against the Scousers but I was well chuffed when we won midweek) and just generally getting caught up in the buildup for the weekend.  I haven't done that in years, and it's all because it just got INTERESTING again, and now it feels like, somehow, it all means a bit more to me than it did this time last year.  I'd managed to forget (and I blame the media glamorisation of football for this) that being a United supporter isn't about winning, it's about enjoying your club, and identifying with what it means to be United.  If all you're bothered about is your club winning all the time, then go and support Celtic.  United mean more - MUCH more - than just that.",™

They bitch and moan about the *need* to reboot continuity every three years so new people can jump in, but then they throw around these “shocking” soap opera-esque storylines that throw a wrench in the works and screw up the continuity they’re claiming they need to develop to grow the readership.    Take, for example, this solicitation from this month’s Green Lantern:   &gt; “Lights Out will see Lanterns die, others change allegiances—and nothing will be the same ever again! Trust us: We MEAN IT!”    Fucking seriously?  First of all, The New 52 is just now two years old!  They’ve barely completed three story arcs.  And there’s a new writer that has penned all of three issues so far.  Secondly, how is that going to grow a readership?  We’re killing off characters and turning some guys bad, so come check this out and don’t get confused!  And third, there’s *already a MASSIVE cross-over event that just started!*  This is the kind of convoluted shit that drives readers away, devalues old stories, and stifles creative content to begin with.    Yet I can already see next year’s solicitations when New 52 is cancelled across the board and relaunched in some kind of *Bat Crisis* title that coincidentally restarts the New-New52 DCU at Batman #750 with its 52 variant covers.  You know, so that the New Readers™ don’t get bogged down with all of the Forever Evil/Year Zero/H’el on earth/Lights Out continuity. ",™

t5_2qh1q,le_clochard,1380574194,"It's a scriptural reference. Chhattees varna.  &gt;Rajput  a feudal warrior caste in medieval India and a group of high-status castes in modern India. The Rajputs claim descent from the ancient Kshatriya varna, and the name “Rajput” derives from the Sanskrit rajaputra, meaning “raja’s son.” However, most of the 36 Rajput clans are descended not from the Kshatriya but from the elite of the Saka, Huns, Gurjaras, and other tribes that invaded India in the fifth and sixth centuries and assumed a dominant position in various regions of North India in the eighth century. Later, members of the Gonds, Bhar, Kol, and other local feudalized tribes attained Rajput status.  &gt;Between the eighth and 12th centuries, states headed by Rajput dynasties spread throughout North India and Nepal. Ordinary clan members, who represented the states’ military strength, were given conditional possession of villages and became small-scale, and often collective, landowners. During the Muslim conquests of the 12th and 13th centuries, Rajput princes lost most of their holdings, retaining chiefly those holdings in the Himalayan foothills and Rajasthan. The smaller-scale feudal Rajput lords became zamindars under Muslim rule. To this day, Rajputs constitute a populous stratum among the landowners of North India.  &gt;L. B.

t5_2ss5b,Barl0we,1380576120,"&gt;How would the first two comments qualify SRS as a hate group? Calling people shitlords?  Yes, how do slurs qualify the people who use them as hateful?  &gt;The third one is quite extreme, but that is in retaliation to hateful comments by others.  So that makes it ok? I notice that people weren't disagreeing with that person. In fact, browsing SRS a few times, the idea of wishing death on others isn't exactly often disagreed with, as long as it's ""shitlords"".  &gt;I've seen similar sentiments expressed towards minorities many times on reddit, does that qualify reddit as a hate group?  I've seen racist sentiments posted on Facebook. Does that make everyone who posts on Facebook a racist?  The difference here being that not everyone on reddit identifies as part of ShitRedditSays. I'm not going to whine about what others do or do not do vis a vis bigotry, but I'd appreciate not being lumped in as some amorphous group with people that I do not identify with. But then, that's ever been one of the fallacies of SRS: The whole ""US VS THEM"", there are [le]terally only either Brave SRS Warriors™ who stand against the tide of shitlords, and then the poor unfortunates caught in between (who are either shitlords or speshul snowflakes if they do not agree with SRS).

That's the beauty of this not being a circlejerk™ sub. There are loads of different people who post here, whose primary ""le reddit faction"" is not SRD.

The near boiling occurs in the heat exchanger, adjunct compartments and keg.Through testing we have found that there is nothing magical about boiling- it’s just traditional since beer was invented a long time before thermometers and process controls. In a conventional homebrew system, boiling is important since the temperature control is not as precise- keeping the entrie kettle at 208° steadily for an hour is impossible for most home brew systems. Also in home brew systems, a vigorous boil ensures mixing of the brew kettle. In the Zymatic™, this mixing is done by circulating the wort. We have run extensive testing for hops extraction, off flavors and clarity, and have found no detraction from running slightly less than boil.  I'm still skeptical, but there you go.",™
