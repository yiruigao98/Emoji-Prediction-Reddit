It IMPAIRS your ability to make sound decisions, and you're much more likely to be robbed by a drug user needing drug money than a non drug user.   On top of that, despite tobacco being legal, 55,000 people die per year from second-hand smoke. These arrogant assholes actually think their habit is worth all those lives. FUCK YOU and FUCK THEM.

t5_2qh1i,GeeJo,1364789472,"The seminal example of this type of experimental failure is Prosper-René Blondlot's N-Ray debacle.   X-rays had just been discovered, and many prominent physicists, including Blondlot, were experimenting with them in search of new Science™. One experiment in particular bore exciting fruit. Blondlot superheated a thin piece of platinum inside an aluminium box, allowing the resulting electromagnetic radiation to escape through a small slit. When a flame was placed in front of the slit, it brightened. Sheets coated in cadmium sulfide would become slightly luminous.   Naturally, weird results like this generated a lot of interest. Over 120 scientists throughout France tried out his procedure and managed to replicate Blondlot's results. He went on to refine the process, replacing the slitted box with specially-designed aluminium prisms that would focus these ""N-Rays"" for stronger results, publishing some dozen papers outlining which materials were capable of producing or blocking this novel form of radiation.  Not everyone was convinced. Outside of France, British and American scientists were largely unable to replicate the experimental results. Blondlot dismissed them as amateurs, unable to correctly set up the equipment. He didn't laugh for long. In 1904, Blondlot was running another iteration of the experiment - covering and uncovering the apparatus while an assistant noted the resulting increase and decrease in luminosity. The American physicist invited to observe, a guy named Robert Wood, was less than impressed. You see, while Blondlot and his assistant blustered on, gathering exactly the results they had expected to see, Wood had silently removed the core of the equipment, the aluminium prism, from inside the box.   The British journal *Nature* happily spread Wood's report across the globe, and Blondlot became a laughing-stock. The other scientists who had corroborated the earlier results quietly shelved their N-Ray equipment and went back to what they were doing before.   This is why you blind your experiments.",™

EDIT: It's not immediately apparent in the video, but the Boominator5000 can be carried around and attached like KAS suction cups (it uses the KAS partmodule actually) and when it detonates, it delivers a large amount of heat to nearby parts, causing them to explode. It doesn't need to be connected to the target parts to work, it will destroy (or at least try to damage) any parts in range; the idea is to act as much like real explosives as possible, though I suppose it needs to add some force to push everything away from it too.",™

It really is rare, and the guys who do it are mostly fringe-of-jazz players, not Jazz™ proper.  [Some Ribot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Thc_Ajn1fw), approximating jazz on what I'm pretty sure is a Jazzmaster. I'm not a Fender guy, and I've never played with any, so I can't tell Jazzmasters and Jaguars apart.  This is probably a Jaguar, I think, [but, whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjIpRzaEVgc). Awesome show. And presumably it qualifies as jazz, since Tim Berne is there.  The jazz/fusion guys I know don't like Nels's music (or Ribot's, except the Latin stuff) because the rock he fuses his jazz with is weird-chord '90s rock, and the jazz he fuses to his '90s rock is more Coltrane than Miles. Basically, all that stuff is *ugly*, deep down in its very chords, so it's rock, not jazz. Go figure!

t5_2qm4e,yousefk,1364837342,"Yes. I've been in the bacon industry for years now. Let's analyze this question.  As you may already know, bacon comes from a complex biological organism of the genus Sus, commonly known as pigs. These pigs reproduce sexually at a rate of 3 pigs every month for each 2 pigs. It's expected that 1/3 of the babies die from natural causes. So every month, 2 new pigs are introduced to the world.  Increased bacon consumption at a rate of 16 packs of Pepperidge Farm® Ultra-Premium^tm Bacon per person per month would result in the pig population decreasing by 1 pig every month.  With less pigs, there is less work necessary for cleaning, killing, and processing the pigs at pig farms. This results in less emissions from the pig farms themselves.  Pepperidge Farm® is a big contributor to clean energy solutions and less overall emissions. By buying bacon from Pepperidge Farm® you are ensuring that the world is free of CO2 and other harmful emissions.  ",®

t5_2qj8u,bifftradwell,1364841290,"Chill haze is caused by unwanted proteins that remain in solution in your beer during the brewing and fermentation process. When you finally chill the beer they precipitate out of solution but remain in suspension; this makes the beer hazy. When the beer warms up, they dissolve again leaving the beer clear.  The obvious answer to avoid chill haze, then, is to drink your beer at room temperature.  Assuming that won't work for you, and you can't switch to an InBev-approved Beer Substitute™, then try the following in your next batch:  * make sure to get good convection currents in your boil; it should look a little like hot-and-sour soup with big flaky white stuff (coagulated protein) swimming in it * don't boil so hard that the lipids and proteins actually emulsify into the wort * use Irish moss or whirlfloc in the last 15 minutes of the boil * use an immersion chiller, plate chiller or counter-flow chiller to cool the wort quickly, especially trying to drop from near-boiling to 100 ºF in 10 minutes or less * if you keg, consider using gelatin or another fining agent for a few days prior to serving the beer.",™

t5_2sljg,daprice82,1364849181,"I think he may eventually get back into the main title picture but I doubt they're gonna make him champion again any time soon, if ever.  Dude is on ""strike 2"" (really, like, strike 5 but we're going on WWE's Official Tally™ and pretending they haven't been sweeping incidents under the rug for years) and at that point, how can he really be trusted to be your top guy ever again?  Even if he never fucks up again, he's spending his entire career teetering on the edge.  He's going to have to earn their trust back, and as media-conscious as WWE is, I can't imagine they'll ever fully trust him again.",™
t5_2u3ds,Faceh,1364849698,"Thing is, socialists generally have to sidestep the whole scarcity issue when advancing their policies. ""Yeah, we can make sure EVERYONE has a basic standard of living guaranteed and nobody will be left out! There'll be enough doctors and medical care for everyone!*""  (*Standard of living will be much lower than the one you currently enjoy. Socialism™ cannot be blamed for any famines, genocides, or misery that may result from use of these policies.)  It bugs me when they seem to think that we OUGHT to stop everything and fix every problem *now.* Its as if humanity can't be allowed to progress until ALL of us have met some minimal standard of living (that THEY get to determine). That humanity can't be allowed to progress as long as injustice exists.      When I point out that this is impossible and it'd be better to let human progress continue unabated, which will eventually (if we don't kill ourselves) raise everyone's standard of living in the process, they tend to waffle and talk about ""good of society.""     I mean, if we all lived in grass huts and grew little gardens for ourselves we could surely provide THAT basic standard of living. But humanity won't amount to much at that point.  Edit: And that's probably a reason why Socialists like to pimp their wares in relatively prosperous, first world countries. People wouldn't believe their claims in a poor third world country where there's not enough wealth to spread around in the first place. But when you live in a country that is enjoying the wealth and prosperity that comes with Capitalism, it suddenly begins to seem like there *is* enough to go around.",™

t5_2s3yz,cfschris,1364852511,"1. It's allowed me to really grasp the concept that everything, literally everything in life is dynamic. Even if something may seem stationary, it'll still be moving as either a whole system (see: the entire damn galaxy and everything within it drifting through space) or at the molecular level, with each individual atom vibrating as their electrons whip around their nuclei.  2. Every living thing is a direct redistribution of energy. To think that all which you eat every day to keep alive is only a few degrees of separation from sunlight is mind blowing. It's a really simple fact, but when you mull over it for a damn long time it's incredibly fascinating. Why does life work that way, where simple radiation is all which drives all living things?  3. The fact that all animate matter is driven to procreate. From simple viruses to the most complex of organisms, there exists the wiring which compels us to turn more inanimate matter into animated before we ourselves return to dust.   Honestly, I have no answers, but this state of detachment has given me a profoundly greater appreciation for the questions. I truly feel that there's greater things at work in this fantastic, infinitely complex universe than just my own, hopelessly ForeverAlone™ self....and that's an incredibly comforting thing.",™

t5_2sokd,finalduty,1364876809,"&gt; Do you recommend one site vs. another? Why so?  It comes down to personal preference and what you're hoping to get out of it in terms of cost, support and ease of use. At the end of the day, they all sell the same thing, it's the interface and support that changes. If you're competent with DNS, what will be better for you will be different to someone who has no idea and wants it to Just Work™.  &gt; Also, many domain names of full names, e.g. johndoe.com, are bought by companies whose main purpose is to sell them. Are you familiar with the companies and their dealings? Can they be negotiated with?  I am familiar with them and although I personally frown on that business methodology, it's not illegal (afaik). I believe there is room to haggle with them but haven't had much to do with them in terms of actually buying from them. My understanding is that once you've paid for it, they will update the ownership details and provide you with the EPP Code for it (or your country's equivalent) to transfer where you like. I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous, but it comes down to Supply/Demand. They do need to keep renewing the domains so it costs them until someone caves and pays for it :) -_-",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1364881033,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  See also: &gt;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.   Hebrews 13:8  &gt;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, **with whom there is no variation**  or shifting shadow.  James 1:17  &gt;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?  Numbers 23:19  &gt;He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.""  1 Samuel 15:29  &gt; For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.  (Revelations 22:18-19) ",™

Match Types detail the specific goal for the teams playing in the Match, as well as laying out the rules that must be followed in its pursuit. Objectives vary from “Drag, Capture and interrogate""  in the Snatch and Grab Match Type to wresting a sentient loadstone to your will in MobBall. In addition, each Match Type has variants to the original objective and/or parameters, allowing players and GMs to tailor each Match to their specifications and to breathe new life and ""replayability "" into each Match Type. (yep, I know ""replayability"" isn't a word yet! :) There are 15 unique Match Types in the book with each having 2-4 variants. That's about 50 different styles of play and/or objectives.  • Battlepoints: A rating system to estimate a character’s ability to compete in player vs. player Matches. It also allows the GM to judge the fairness of a Match. For example, Characters with a large disparity in Battlepoints should not compete against each other. Before a Match the GM sets a limit on Battlepoints called the Battlepoint Cap. Players cannot exceed this value when creating characters.  • Map Elements: physical entities players and teams can purchase and place on the Conflict Map in order to provide tactical advantages. These elements include a variety of traps, both magical and mundane, as well as healing enchantments, barriers and even creatures that instinctively fight on the side of the team that placed them.   • Planted Items: Planted items allow the GM to mess with the teams' plans by adding magic items to the match before it begins. Planted items are objects that provide a strategic advantage—like a freakn' vorpal sword—to the character who claims them. As such, the attempt to garner Planted Items often becomes a mini-objective unto itself. However, other players can sometimes use Planted Items as bait, so be careful.   • REAL HIDDEN MOVEMENT WITH PASSCARDS! A Passcard™ is a single sheet of paper designed to allow players to communicate privately amongst themselves and with the GM. The use of Passcards in planning such hidden movement actions like invisibility, stealth or ambushes is a valuable tool that helps prevent metagaming. Passcards along with our battlemaps allow the GM to take a miniature off the battlefield and work in secret!

I am trying to find a clear posited claim for debate and it's difficult.  I shall try to respond in kind:  Theists are, by definition, self-serving sycophants and retoupin (OP) is the Kind.  [insert banal unsupported opinion here]  &gt; To cling to your arguments once they have been shown false demonstrates a religious atheism more misguided than the leaders of Westboro Baptist.  While the actions and positions of the leaders and adherents of the WBC are, indeed, reprehensible, it is interesting to note that the positions of the WBC are more in line with the attributed narrative of Yahwehism than the cherry-picked precepts that the overwhelming majority of Christians follow and profess today. Don't get me wrong, I would rather have the disingenuous cherry-pickers over that of the reprehensible true Yahwists any day; but the WBC is closer to True Christianity™ than other Christians.   OP, I challenge you to post a new topic that is a real debate - one that puts forth a clear claim or argument in support of a position you hold, that you back that position up and attempt to limit the fallacious statements.  Since it appears you are a Yahwist (from a Torah/OT citation), here is a position you can use: There is no God but Yahweh/Allah (monotheistic Yahwehism) and this Yahwehism does not have it's origins in the revealed holy scripture of a highly polytheistic pantheon of Deities from the very peoples and beliefs from which the Israelites of the Bible evolved.  I will send a telepathic prayer to your God, Yahweh, asking that God for a Cheat to Life through the belief that a prayer of intercession or petition will be answered in assisting you in your endeavors to support your religious Faith against the fools that are atheists, and that if God does not see fit to change It's Plan/Will to assist  you in your holy endeavor, that God does continues to support your abstention and dismissal of personal responsibility through your belief in a Sovereign God. I will also send the same prayer to Yahweh's brother Ba'al and Yahweh's Father, El. ",™

t5_2qhix,fauststriving,1364939626,"Sometimes people ask for advice when they really just want to share a bad beat. So, just in case: ""Man, what a brutal beat! That's poker."" You can stop reading now.  On the other hand, if you really want advice, here we go:  **Pre-flop**  Of course this is an easy fold. And not even a fold to the $8. It's a fold for $2. Our decisions are easier in position than out of position. We steal more pots in position, and we make more money off of our big hands in position. Further, when we limp, we open ourselves up to bleeding off $2 each time someone raises behind; even worse, we often talk ourselves into going ahead and calling the raise. We don't want to play pots out of position if we can help it. I know you have said, ""Yeah, yeah, I know it's a fold, but..."". You need to let the advice to fold here fully sink in. Mistakes multiply as hands progress, and small mistakes pre-flop often lead to justifying a slightly larger mistake on the flop, and then we're getting pot odds on the turn. And, suddenly, we're wondering how we got 50 BB in with a pair and a gutshot (or whatever part of the board we hit). Seriously, if you aspire to poker greatness, do yourself a favor and forget trying to outplay people OOP with weak holdings. You'll have plenty of opportunities to outplay people in position, or with strong cards.  Also, the best way to ""roll with your heater"" is to not bleed the money off on the very next hand. A nice run doesn't have to include every single hand you're dealt.  **Flop**  You lucky bastard. Blind squirrels and all that. You've got a the stone Nutter Butters®. Calling here is fine. However, with the stack sizes, I may go ahead and put in a raise in order to make sure we get stacks in by the river. If he has a medium pair, he's likely not folding now. If he was the miracle 4, he's definitely going to give you value. And he's probably continuing with a hand like 56. Basically, he's probably only folding an airball bluff on this board. If he's prone to airballs on good boards, then I guess I prefer just calling, but it's rare to face that kind of opponent at $1/2  Another reason to flat is that raising forces out the pre-flop raiser, and, as you said, ""the more the merrier"". Ultimately, I'm fine with either just calling or with raising the flop.  **Turn**  Villain isn't checking a 4 very often, so now we're against (1) airballs that have now given up, (2) medium pairs that are scared of our flop call (or boated with 88), or (3) straight draws that don't want to push too hard. I prefer to bet here unless we think category (1) will fire rivers if we check behind and we have reason to think that villain is weighted toward airballs. Otherwise, put villain to the test when he has medium pairs, and get value from his OESDs that are drawing dead.  Another reason to bet turn is that we are giving villain a freeroll with medium pocket pairs. Bart Hanson talks about this specific situation a lot when it comes to slowplaying flopped trips (and we can treat this small boat similarly to flopped trips against medium pairs). If we don't bet, then we give our opponent with 55, 66, 77 or 99 a free shot at our whole stack since we can't fold when they hit their 5%-er.  **River**  Kind of ugly, I guess. I know everyone seems to be saying you have to raise. There are merits on both sides. The turn and river card both hit the range of medium pairs that we thought he may have when he bet out. If he has a different medium pair (55, 66, 77, 99, TT), he isn't supposed to call our raise here anyway. Maybe we think this villain would, and since I wasn't there, I can't say. But I know sometimes I'd bet 77 or 99 on this river, but it's a clear bet/fold. If he has an airball or missed straight draw, he can't call obviously.  So what hands specifically are we trying to get value from with our raise? He pretty much can't have an overpair now (since he'd 3-bet QQ+ almost 100% of the time). Mostly it's hands like A4, 45, and 46, although it's rare for those hands to check the turn. It's close, and I'm sure I'd end up shoving most of the time here, too. But I'd be doing to in order to get called by hands that, by all accounts, *should not be calling*. The only hand that is supposed to call here is maybe A4, and in my experience most 1/2 villains don't lead flop/check turn with A4 on this kind of board.  Anyway, the point is that we aren't just thinking about our absolute hand strength, but about what hands villain can call with. Since there are no straights, no flushes, and he can't even have an overpair, our under-full is actually on the thinner side of river raising here.  When he re-raises, we're almost always beat, but we can't fold so we open up /r/poker and make a post to help soothe ourselves. By the way, if you were playing deeper (say, 300BB effective), the river is definitely a fold  when you have the under-full and it goes lead-raise-re-raise with no flush and no straight possible.  tl;dr: I were only supposed to lose $8 here, but you got unlucky and lost a lot more.",®

Also, should I get rid of Gold and just have Golden Apples alone, without the Gold also being there, for similar reasons?~~   Edit 6: Cleared out shit, decided to go through with Edit 4 anyways. It didn't occur to me how difficult it would be to see what Nebs has in-depth, so I'll just assume Stone Sword for now, 10 HP, and after watching the CobbleHATERz swigview, I'll see if anybody glances towards Nebs to check what his Armor is at.

t5_2rxrw,Vanetia,1364941819,"&gt;You're able to live at some level of comfort and are able to raise a family without the benefit of a salary or wage, which makes your path easier and more privileged than the paths trudged by zillions of parents who do not have that option.   What about those of us who became stay-at-home parents because child care costs would have eaten up any wages we would have earned? It's not a life of privilege that led me to choose to be a SAHM (when I was one). It was the fact that anything I made would have just barely covered the child care costs.  I don't think it's the Hardest Job in the World™, but I can easily say having an 8-5 is *easier* for me. I get adult interaction, I get to actually work towards goals, I get to earn my own wage rather than be reliant on my spouse, and I don't have to change diapers or deal with a screaming infant.  I think the reason SAHPs go around saying the job is so fucking hard is because so many people look at it and say ""Oh pfft. You get to sit around the house all day and do nothing."" when it is far more than that.",™

t5_2qh68,theartfulcodger,1364973337,"Edit: [Relevant news item](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/04/03/sk-saskatoon-scientist-discusses-muzzling-concerns-1402.html)   Horseshit. We're not talking about military secrets, here. These are either *federal* employees, or scientists employed by *public* universities, doing research with *taxpayer's* money on *non-strategic* issues.  Certainly, not *all* federally-researched scientific information should be available to the public *all* the time. Certain kinds of research need to remain confidential for national security or reasons involving litigation or economics, and more needs to be properly collated and confirmed before formal release; raw data can be misinterpreted and taken out of context.   But surely a *reasonable* amount of timely public access to non-confidential issues, *unbuffered by political implications*  - especially those concerning the environment or impacting public health or safety - is only appropriate. However, by *insisting* that there *must* be a ministerial screen between the people asking the questions and the technical wonks that know the answers, the entire process of disseminating scientific truth to the public becomes highly politicized, and therefore tainted.   Sixty years ago, within the old Soviet military system, every company had its own propaganda officer watching carefully for lack of revolutionary enthusiasm or political backsliding within the ranks; thinkers of ""incorrect thought s"" were identified and punished. Similarly today, Harper's communication flacks and PR toadies want to carefully screen all Canadian scientists' communications for any scientific recidivism that could *possibly* run counter to the day's talking points, as issued from Conservative Party HQ on Albert Street. Those scientists that resist will either be quietly made redundant, or their projects will simply be moved out of the light of day; witness the rank stupidity of the recent Experimental Lakes Project cluster-fuck.   It has become exceedingly clear that Harper is determined to deny the Canadian public *any* scientific knowledge that might reflect poorly on his decisions, his legacy or his political priorities - like the increasing devastation being caused by the ramped-up oil sands extraction he so heavily promotes, or the growing body of evidence about the dangers of fracking, or the ongoing, nationwide acidification of our freshwater lakes, *or* the ongoing disappearance of indigenous species, including several key food species (like pacific salmon), through loss of habitat and overharvesting. These are critical issues for our country, and Canadians deserve both pertinent and timely information about them, information which they are now *officially* and *formally* being denied simply because certain scientific truths clearly demonstrate the perverseness and wooden-headednes of established Conservative Party dogma.  As just one example of the government's communications policy going awry, for a media project two years ago, a colleague had to get an answer to a technical question about our Anik 1 satellite. This is a satellite that was placed in geostationary orbit forty years ago, so it was hardly commercially strategic information. He had an engineer contact at Telesat Canada that found him the exact information he required within an hour, but the engineer was unauthorized to release it without Ministerial approval. The government took more than SIXTY DAYS to respond, and then failed to answer the question, which was non-strategic and simply dealt with bandwidth. Instead, they just mailed my colleague a thick packet of public relations fluff on what a great aerospace program The Harper Government™ had put together for us.   And we, the taxpayers, pay for this kind of deliberate obfuscation and purposeless deflection. What bullshit.",™

It's: thinkpad enthusiasts pursue numerous avenues concurrently to make current thinkpads better, old thinkpads newer, and in combining the two, create the laptop they want.  *You're rolling your eyes, and that's ok!

t5_2wr7r,emmster,1365010468,"That's an approach that certainly could work for some people. My eating disorder was a restrictive type, so, really, putting any food into my body was a victory for a while, and if it wasn't what I felt like eating, it just wasn't going to happen. Comfort food went down easier. If I'd taken the time to even think about nutrition, it would have been really easy to go right back to living on lettuce and ice cubes. So, depending on your individual case, getting enjoyment out of food can be important. (HAES isn't just for fat people. You might be surprised how many recovering anorexics and bulimics use it.)  I still couldn't eat the same thing every day and stay in recovery, and calorie counting can get dangerous, because I get all competitive about beating yesterday's count, and next thing you know, back to the lettuce and ice thing.   Fundamentally changing how I relate to food is the only thing that's worked. I can now see eating as a normal part of life, instead of an enemy I need to conquer. And if I really want a cheeseburger, I can eat one, without thinking about how many calories, fat grams, carb grams, or Points™ it has. And instead of picking at a salad and fixating on the burger, when I'm done, I'm done. And chances are better than 99% that all my body wants the next day is fresh produce. Which is fine with me.   The way that shakes out in terms of calories, if I were to count them out is that I might go over 2000 one day, but only hit about 900 the next. And since the body doesn't work on a strict 24 hour cycle where everything has to be perfectly calculated every day, it averages out to me losing about 10 pounds a year for the last 5 or 6 years. (With a few ups and down in between.) Since I have a history of restrictive eating disorder, I sometimes have to remind myself that the weight loss is really neither good nor bad. It just is. What matters is that I don't have intrusive or disruptive thoughts or behaviors surrounding food, that my blood pressure, glucose, and lipids are still on target, and that my injured knee is still in good enough shape that I can continue running my two miles every morning, because I fucking *need* that for my mental health. (Seriously, running is as good as therapy for my particular brain.)  So, for me, that's health. And what it says on the scale, or on the tags in my pants just isn't relevant. You're allowed to have different priorities for your own health needs. We're not the same, and no single thing is going to work for everyone. Some people need to prioritize their mental health, some people need to be aware of specific health risks, like family history, and prioritize behaviors that help them minimize that risk.   Anyway, that's what HAES has done for me, and that's why I think it's a good idea. ",™

t5_2t25p,NiftyDolphin,1365016490,"Are you tracking her cycle? If not, do so. I use an app called MyDays. There are tons out there.  Starting about seven to ten days after she starts her menses to about day sixteen she'll be in her fertile phase. I got money that your 'once a month' is happening during this time.  During the Dark Ages™ of my marriage, I could tell when my wife was fertile because.... well, because she was nice to me.  So, look for her to be a bit nicer, a bit softer, cuddly, and easy-going personality wise during this time.   She'll also show a bit more skin. Not tons, just a little. Maybe she'll wear something shiny when she normally doesn't.  So, I usually initiate early in the fertile time-period- day seven or eight. My wife doesn't want sex as much as I do, so after those sexy-times, I give her another few days before I try again. I don't want her to feel pressured.  So you could try on day eight and again on day 14. If she goes along: you've doubled the amount of sex you two are having!   So, during this time, try the opening moves from my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1bl9hc/ok_so_um_my_new_db_woes_success_post/). Don't set yourself up for failure by trying something that has historically been shot down. If you traditionally ask for sex in a certain way and she traditionally shoots you down, make sure you **don't initiate in that way**.   Sometimes it's easier to follow the script that you've set for yourself. She'll recognize the ""he asks and I say no"" pattern and just go along with it. You've danced that dance once again and it ends with you slinking off to your computer and YouPorn. You want to make sure to avoid patterns that traditionally lead to rejection. Try something new.   The other time that I've noticed my wife is more interested is a day or two before her period starts. You may find that your wife is the same. If so, then you could potentially double or triple the amount of sex you have.",™

Description: Wrote the first sentence of my developer blog. This achievement doesn’t reward me with a title, but it does increase my Galactic Reputation with the Community Team, so I’ve got that going for me!  &gt;[Game Update 2.0: Scum and Villainy](http://www.swtor.com/gameupdates/2.0-scum-and-villainy) introduces the Legacy Achievements system, a means of recognizing important accomplishments and milestones for your entire Legacy. Achievements are like badges awarded for completing content, defeating enemies, exploring new regions, and a whole lot more. The Achievements you gather are displayed in a new section of your Legacy panel, where they can be viewed by other players to see how much you have accomplished with your Legacy.  &gt;What sets Legacy Achievements in Star Wars™: the Old Republic™ apart from similar achievement systems in many other games is that actions from all characters in your Legacy contribute to your Legacy Achievements. Need to discover and dance with 100 kinds of womp rats on Tatooine? No sweat---dance with 50 of them with your Scoundrel while he is on the planet and then go dance with the other 50 later with your Powertech. Your progress is tracked across both characters and the Achievement and its rewards are available to all characters in your Legacy. So you are always contributing to the same set of Achievements and rewards regardless of which character you are playing.  &gt;##The Basics  &gt;Every Achievement has tasks that are required to unlock it, which are displayed in the Achievement description. For example, the Master Craftsman Achievement requires you to have hit 450 points with each crew skill. As you complete tasks in the list, they will be checked off and will display as completed. When all tasks on the list are complete, the Achievement is considered completed, and a banner will display on screen letting you know that you have finished it. If you belong to a guild, all guild mates will receive notification of your accomplishment in the chat window, with an option to click on the linked Achievement and find out more about what you accomplished.    &gt;It is important to note that we never take Achievements or Achievement progress away---if you complete part of an Achievement that asks you to reach Light V alignment with a character, and then make a turn to the dark side with that same character, your Achievement for having hit Light V is not revoked. If, however, the Achievement specifies that you need to dance with 100 womp rats while you are Light V (apparently our example user is a prolific at dancing with womp rats), you will need to maintain that Light V status while you progress the Achievement.    &gt;You may view another player’s Achievements at any time by right clicking their portrait in-game and selecting Additional Commands -&gt; Inspect Achievements. You will be able to fully browse their progress in any category, as well as see their overall Achievement score and any recent accomplishments they’ve achieved.  &gt;##Types of Achievements  &gt;* **Companion**: Companion Achievements recognize Achievements related to your companion characters. Examples include Achievements for maxing out affection ratings or defeating enemies with certain companions active. * **Flashpoint**: Flashpoint Achievements recognize defeating tough encounters in both normal and hard mode flashpoints, as well as meta Achievements for completing many different flashpoint Achievements. * **Legacy**: The Legacy category encompasses all Achievements related to the progression of your characters, from leveling to wealth to possessions to alignment. * **Location**: Location Achievements recognize progress on each planet. This encompasses story moments on these planets, Heroic Missions, Datacrons found, and anything else specific to a given planet. * **Operations**: Operation Achievements recognize Achievements for completing encounters and challenges in Operations of all difficulty levels. * **Player Vs. Player**: Player Vs. Player Achievements are awarded for hitting certain targets or milestones in Warzones as well as some more generic player on player accomplishments. * **Space**: Space Achievements are awarded for completing missions and bonus objectives in space missions, as well as meta Achievements for completing certain sets of space content.  &gt;##Achievement Rewards  &gt;All Achievements reward the player with Prestige, a score showing the combined value of your completed Achievements. Any player inspecting your Achievements can immediately see your total Prestige and get an idea of just how much of the game you have completed and explored.  &gt;Some tough Achievements will grant the player Legacy Titles usable by all members of your Legacy. For example, the Master Craftsman Achievement referenced earlier bestows the title of Master Craftsman across your entire Legacy.  &gt;A small number of Achievements will grant Cartel Coins to your account. These Achievements only reward Cartel Coins once per account instead of once per Legacy.  &gt;##What Achievements Will I Have on Day One?  &gt;On day one, we will automatically grant Achievements for everything that can be easily verified and tracked on your character. Any quests you have completed, codices you have found, items you have, pets or vehicles you have collected, or levels you have attained will all be counted towards immediately updating your Achievement progress. You will likely find that you have many Achievements already when you log in to Game Update 2.0 for the first time.  &gt;Sadly, we cannot track every single womp rat you have ever danced with, nor every Jawa you’ve bested in combat. Achievements related to defeating enemies or players will not update automatically on day one, but will start keeping score as soon as the update is live.  &gt;The exception to this rule is anything that was previously tracked by codex entries, such as the Achievements for defeating planetary world bosses and some Flashpoint/Operations encounters. Players who have been around a while may have some codex entries labeled “Achievement” for defeating world bosses or Flashpoint/Operations encounters. New equivalent Achievements exist for the old codex Achievements, and you will be automatically granted the new type of Achievement and any rewards conferred by that Achievement.  &gt;##Something Doesn’t Add Up!  &gt;Players on our Public Test Server (PTS) have noticed that the point totals for each Achievement category don’t necessarily match up with the visible point totals for all Achievements within those categories. You are quite correct! The numbers do not always add up. Maybe there’s something hidden waiting to be discovered…  &gt;##What’s Next  &gt;Additional Legacy Achievements will continue to be added with future content in Star Wars: The Old Republic. New regions, Flashpoints, Operations, and content of all kinds will have new Achievements in the future with new rewards for you to collect. The initial set of Achievements delivered with Game Update 2.0 comprises more than 2000 individual Achievements and nearly 30,000 Prestige points to collect. We are looking forward to expanding the types, complexity and range of Achievements that you can earn, We plan to continuing to push the Achievement System further to encompass every part of the game now and every part of it going forward.  &gt;Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some womp rats to dance with.  &gt;William Wallace  &gt;Senior Game Designer",™

So, I want to ask you were you in that kind of mood when you were creating these songs, maybe and are you sort of melancholic type by nature or it has nothing to do with that? :) I was always wondering about that. :) Never stop creating! ;)  P.S. My favorite song from that album is Gleypa okkur. :)  Your biggest fan! ♥",♥

t5_2qstm,pentium4borg,1365026941,"IMO, the only investments on that list you should consider are the Spartan index funds. Everything else is too expensive. If you're doing a core three/cour four portfolio, you only need index funds for those asset allocations.  Unfortunately, the you don't have a bond index fund in your list of choices. What you should do in this case is split your 401(k) between total stock and international:  &gt; * FSTVX (Spartan® Total Market Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class) (ER: 0.075) &gt; * FSIVX (Spartan® International Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class) (ER: 0.17%)  Then, in your Roth IRA, overweight your bond allocation so that the total across all your accounts is your target percentage.

t5_2qh1m,jaemx,1365048065,"You've done a good job in creating a basic site, but you have a while to go. The site is not awful, but at the same time, I wouldn't pay for it myself hehe.  1. Stay away from full black backgrounds, it gives the impression of the site being ""closed in"" or claustrophobic. If the client does specifically want a black background, have a look at putting a subtle repeating pattern background. There are some great subtle patterns [here](http://subtlepatterns.com/)  2. Look at adding colour, the site is v. monochrome at the moment. [Adobe Kueler](https://kuler.adobe.com/#themes/rating?time=30) is a good resource if you're looking for something spiffy.  3. Get rid of the vector silhouettes from the first slide of the image slide. That particular design trend went out of fashion a while ago and makes the site look dated.  4. Look at some more engaging titles. Everyone has ""who we are"" sections...so what makes me want to read this one?  5. Never put low quality pictures on the site, especially for things like a staff bio. Your great web design can be let down by crappy, inconsistent staff shots. If the clients want a staff bio page, ensure that they have consistent, well-taken photos, that are provided to you in an appropriate size.  6. Make sure you use a font that includes the © symbol, if you want to use it in the footer.  7. Look at making your site responsive, it's a little bit more work now, for a better end user experience. It's great practice, if you're wanting to get more into freelancing and having a portfolio of quality work is what will make you stand out, when approaching businesses about work.  This sounds like a bit of a slam down, but honestly you've made a good start. If you work on the little things and better yourself as you develop new sites, each site you do will be of better quality than the last.  Good luck!",©

t5_2ql4m,vicariouslyeye,1365055627,"Catholicism plays the role of faith--one of the most essential parts of existential understanding. Faith is a sort of backbone that thwarts the decay of nihilism, regardless of what that faith may be.   I believe that seeing existentialism pessimistically or negatively implies that the journey into its subject matter has just begun--these are thoughts that every human being must, at some point along the line, encounter, confront, and grow from dealing with (unless they are hoping for a serious array of personal issues revolving around their inability to address their lurking existential inquiries that they fear too much to consider, as they know deep down that they have built a deep-rooted fabrication of identity that will crumble if an existential inquiry is conducted). We all share fears of death and mortality, and pretending otherwise just adds to the delusion that each moment is not as precious as the last. How I have dealt with the problem is extremely intricate, as I suspect each person's process of coping with such naturally inclined angst must come from their own personal understanding of what makes them tick, and how to be strong. the common demoninator is in realizing that nihilism is more or less philosophical suicide, and there is little contribution opposed to a lazy suicide that will come of a strict belief in it. That being said, it is natural for each of us to arrive at nihilism at certain points in life (related post I just put up: http://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1bn8os/nihilism_rational_reality_or_philosophical/ apologies for the shameless market thought you may find it interesting, I personally see it as the essential question of existentialism that roots beneath most other questions and problems).   The most gratifying part, in my opinion (of course, when wouldn't this be opinion ;) would be that existentialism is the one field of study that allows for a bit more wiggle room than other academic fields--something about a personal and vulnerable examination of the self actually existing in established studies makes me smile on the inside. Existentialism, to me, is the process of moving through the emotions of life and death so that one can truly live, rather than putting off reality so that one may be overwhelmed by middle aged crisis and late aged delusions. All in all--the most gratifying part is treating depression with your own mind as opposed to a pill. That is my take, anyways...Hope it helps ♥",♥

A convention in Las Vegas invited 22 guests they couldn't afford, and during the con they ran out of money before it ended, and everyone got kicked out early on the last day of the convention. Lots of people got stranded in Las Vegas because they were being charged for rooms that had been comped, voice actors didn't get paid for their travel/room/appearance expenses. In response, most voice actors are no longer going to newer cons out of fear that they'll get stiffed out of their money again.

No further information has been released.  Enterplay is releasing a second wave of trading cards.  The show was dubbed into Japanese and released in Japan.

t5_2ubz7,Virtualization_Freak,1365107977,"Please, nitpick away.  Since this is for my homelab, in the cases where my UPS or sudden hardware/OS failure accidently corrupts some data, I don't care. As such, I use iSCSI.  Now, I'm assuming you mean this part of the guide: &gt;Putting the ZIL on high speed devices can improve performance for certain workloads, especially those requiring synchronous writes such as NFS clients connecting to FreeNAS® running on VMWare ESXi. In such cases, a dedicated ZIL will make a big difference in performance. Applications that do not do a lot of synchronous writes are less likely to benefit from having dedicated ZIL devices. For VMWare, if a high speed ZIL device is not an option, using iSCSI instead of NFS is a workaround to achieve better performance.  The primary key words being: &gt;especially those requiring synchronous writes  ESXi doesn't use synchronous writes with iSCSI. So even if I do put in a SSD based SLOG, it would make absolutely no difference. No writes would be hitting the SSD.  I'd much rather have access to my data faster by having it on l2arc, versus speeding up some VM's writing to logs (as that is essentially what most home lab VM's do unless you have something crazy going on.)

t5_2sokd,KimJongalreadyUn,1365117088,"Oh sure, just believe his side of the story...  **1953** - Little disagreement with imperialist pigs and their lapdog southies temporarily pauses while we devote more of our attention to great leader. (Whole thing started over our glorious leader accidentally ordering anchovies on pizza!)  **1953-present** - Southies get imperialist pig movies from 1980s in 1990, they think they are so cool. They start touting about how rich they are, because they have easier access to trade and people like them better. Best Korea is left alone, like an abandoned child. Prior to our separation, the south had always been our source of income and food, Best Korea provided them with responsibilities and glorious Leader! But that was not good enough for them! They grow fat and abandon old teachings and ways!  **1994** - Original glorious leader decides to bring war to the heavens, leaving Glorious Leader II in charge.  **2000s** - Best Korea need best energy to run 1980p hi-def TVs before you fat pigs had them, so we start nuclear program. Southies provoke us by sending inappropriate emails to Glorious Leader II and signing his email up for porn, so Best Korea flex muscle to show you to stop!  **March 2010** - Is nice spring day so Best Korea and Southie decide to play a game... They always so mad when they lose a game! Try playing *Sorry!*™ and he throw game board! Anyway, we sink battleship, you lose game... Best Korea, the winner, is somehow the bad guy?  **December 2011** - Glorious Leader II personally develop SUPERFASTGOGOROCKET which take him to be first man on Mars, spread Best Korea significance there.

Southie start mooning Best Korea over border as show of disrespect.  **February 12, 2013** - Best Korea successfully detonates it's 7th nuclear device. It was 150 megaton detonation via suicide kitten!  **March 7** - UN decides Best Korea not sacrifice enough for good of mankind, as life is harder everywhere else. Impose new rules to help the less fortunate southies and imperialist pigs!  **March 11** Southie and pigs start attempting to attack Best Korea, but Glorious leader and Glorious Leader II defend Best Korea by confusing and disorienting them! 100% of their shots missed their Best Korea target! Glorious Grandfather and Glorious Father convince the Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown) to not retaliate, as they were able to save all of Best Korea from damage. They take refuge in their best sacred statues.  **March 12** - Best Korea finally find deed from old island Best Korea won in a poker game with Southie. Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown) readies Best Korea army to defend righteous territory!  **March 14** - Imperialist pigs announce more targets will be available to maximize Best Korea damage!  **March 15** - Best Korea takes day off, goes fishing with whatever was laying around. We did all right, couple of keepers.  **March 17** - Best Korea warns Southies we will defend ourselves with the full might of all of our abilities, CC'd Japan (out of courtesy).  **March 19** - Pigs give us sensor alignment day, our tracking accuracy and targeting performance increases by 0.5% overall (Now at 100.5%)  **March 20** - Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown) sets goal of 105% tracking accuracy and targeting performance, so we tell the pigs we will go to war if they send more planes.  **March 26** - We try to be straight up and tell southie and twinkiestuffed homers if they damage Glorious leader and Glorious Leader II's statues, we will wreck their shit. Not fucking around.  **March 29** - Best Korea cleaning day... Why you so worried? We just cleaning! Spring cleaning! Maybe have yard sale! We invite you but you not smart enough to comprehend Best Korea technology.  Best Korea pre-schooler post video, win contest on Best Korea website. Southie send Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown) a penis text image, he ready us to state of war!  **April 1** - Best Korea not stupid, know that pigs and southie are afraid of nuke. Best Korea like cockroach... We survive. Iran ask Best Korea for nuke, offer billions of dollars! We decline.  **April 2** - New Best Korea only Modern Warfare 5 come out, Best Korea start Super-Overflow-Mega-Reactor #7 to power Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown)'s gift of 55' OLED 5-D TVs to all Best Korea citizens.  **April 3** - Best Korea discover Southie worker is stealing from Best Korea.... Best Korea not allow Southie workers in anymore. Fool me once!  **April 4** Glorious Leader v3.01 (Firmware: Unknown), after all this provocation and dirty attack and immorality from Southie and Imperialist pig, approves nuclear strike via kitten injection on pig territory. He decides before leading glorious Best Korea to war, he will go fishing with whatever was leftover from the yard sale, and sends missiles to east coast.

This is because there are MANY factors to emissions and many process that can be done outside of actual combustion.  &gt; *A-55® L.P. is the source for this information.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1365126299,"  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",™

Prior to the HCTRA stepping in, Hwy 290 was only going to expand by 1 lane on either side and only in certain spots that had already received funding. Some stretches would have had to wait up to 20 years for funding. The new plan with HOV/toll lanes in the middle means the entire expansion will be completed by the end of 2017.

Se trata de uno de los mÃ¡s graves riesgos de guerra nuclear despuÃ©s de la Crisis de Octubre en 1962 en torno a Cuba, hace 50 aÃ±os.  En el aÃ±o 1950 se desatÃ³ allÃ­ una guerra que costÃ³ millones de vidas. HacÃ­a apenas 5 aÃ±os que dos bombas atÃ³micas habÃ­an estallado sobre las ciudades indefensas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki, las que en cuestiÃ³n de minutos mataron e irradiaron a cientos de miles de personas.  En la penÃ­nsula coreana el General Douglas MacArthur quiso emplear las armas atÃ³micas contra la RepÃºblica Popular DemocrÃ¡tica de Corea. Ni siquiera Harry Truman se lo permitiÃ³.  SegÃºn se afirma, la RepÃºblica Popular China perdiÃ³ un millÃ³n de valientes soldados para impedir que un ejÃ©rcito enemigo se instalara en la frontera de ese paÃ­s con su Patria. La URSS, por su parte, suministrÃ³ armas, apoyo aÃ©reo, ayuda tecnolÃ³gica y econÃ³mica.  Tuve el honor de conocer a Kim Il Sung, una figura histÃ³rica, notablemente valiente y revolucionaria.  Si allÃ­ estalla una guerra, los pueblos de ambas partes de la PenÃ­nsula serÃ¡n terriblemente sacrificados, sin beneficio para ninguno de ellos. La RepÃºblica Popular DemocrÃ¡tica de Corea siempre fue amistosa con Cuba, como Cuba lo ha sido siempre y lo seguirÃ¡ siendo con ella.  Ahora que ha demostrado sus avances tÃ©cnicos y cientÃ­ficos, le recordamos sus deberes con los paÃ­ses que han sido sus grandes amigos, y no serÃ­a justo olvidar que tal guerra afectarÃ­a de modo especial a mÃ¡s del 70 % de la poblaciÃ³n del planeta.  Si allÃ­ estallara un conflicto de esa Ã­ndole, el Gobierno de Barack Obama en su segundo mandato quedarÃ­a sepultado por un diluvio de imÃ¡genes que lo presentarÃ­an como el mÃ¡s siniestro personaje de la historia de Estados Unidos. El deber de evitarlo es tambiÃ©n suyo y del pueblo de Estados Unidos.  Fidel Castro Ruz Abril 4 de 2013 11 y 12 p.m.",©

There's a nice (a bit lengthy) editorial about ""snake oil"" type additives [here](http://www.ford-trucks.com/article/idx/18/141/article/Snake_Oil__Is_That_Additive_Really_A_Negative.html), where the author basically lumps them into four most-common categories:  &gt; 1. Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular 50-rated engine oil (including standard additives) with PTFE (Teflon TM) added. &gt; 2. Products that seemed to be nothing more than regular 50-rated engine oil (including standard additives) with zinc dialkyldithiophosphate added. &gt; 3. Products containing (as near as we could determine) much the same additives as are already found in most major brands of engine oil, though in different quantities and combinations. &gt; 4. Products made up primarily of solvents and/or detergents.  There is no PTFE or zinc DDP in these formulations, so this type of additive would not fit under #1 or #2.   The aliphatic petroleum distillates mixture w/ &lt;3% DMSO and the polybutenes seem to be common in engine oils. CAS 8042-47-5 ""white mineral oil"" is not common in engine oil from what I can see. Comparing [this page](http://www.exxonmobil.com/Denmark-English/Specialties/PDS/GLXXENSPCEMPrimol_352.aspx) and [this 5w30 page](http://www.amsoil.com/shop/by-product/motor-oil/gasoline/sae-5w-30-signature-series-100-percent-synthetic-motor-oil/?page=%2fstorefront%2fasl.aspx), the viscosity and the flash points are pretty close, though that's not to say white paraffinic oil is suitable for an engine (especially if it's not designed for it). So all that is left now is this coco dimethylamine oxide (also referenced as Barlox® 12). It makes up a big fraction of what this stuff is, and it's apparently in most of their products; what does it do? Well, from what little I can dig up, it's a surfactant. These major components seem like this product falls into the #4 category, which the author has to say:  &gt; As a general rule of thumb these products had their place and were at least moderately useful on older automobile and motorcycle engines of the Fifties and Sixties, but are basically unneeded on the more efficient engine designs of the past two decades.  [tafelplot](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1bputn/could_an_engineer_tell_me_if_this_automotive/c98ysg8), [Dedwait](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1bputn/could_an_engineer_tell_me_if_this_automotive/c9909pk), [janw86](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1bputn/could_an_engineer_tell_me_if_this_automotive/c991e73), and others all have the right replies that probably supersede mine. Engines and their oil are not just slapped together in a random fashion, they are all designed to be something specific. Adding more or different things will have a better chance of messing things up than making things better.  I thought this line from that original website summed it up nicely:  &gt;If it helps, try to think of your oil like a cake recipe. Just because the original recipe calls for two eggs (which makes for a very moist and tasty cake), do you think adding four more eggs is going to make the cake better? Of course not. You're going to upset the carefully calculated balance of ingredients and magnify the effect the eggs have on the recipe to the point that it ruins the entire cake. Adding more of a specific additive already contained in your oil is likely to produce similar results.  And in the case of adding new things, maybe you like enjoying a nice salmon steak every once in a while... doesn't mean that adding salmon to your cake would be beneficial!",®

Not sure if OP's using the same kind. I had kosher salt on hand, so I used that. However, a few seconds of googling revealed this on Morton's [FAQ](http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/food-salt-faqs):  &gt;In 1924 Morton became the first company to produce iodized salt for the table in order to reduce the incidence of simple goiter. Dextrose is added to stabilize the iodide. Iodine is vital to the proper functioning of the thyroid gland and the prevention of goiter. Actually, the amount of dextrose in salt is so small that it is dietetically insignificant. Morton® Iodized Table Salt contains 0.04 percent dextrose or 40 milligrams per 100 grams of salt. Morton® Plain Table Salt contains neither iodine nor dextrose. All Morton Salt products containing potassium iodide are labeled as such.",®

t5_2soy6,LyricBaritone,1365199647,"I'm a singer, and have worked at several different churches, so I've seen multiple perspectives of this - Catholic, Presbyterian.  Christians believe that since Jesus IS god, that the excruciating agony of crucifixion is God subjecting himself to the worst agony of man.  Taking himself down to our level, and suffering the worst that we would ever have to.  This glorious, splendiferous being that is so powerful experiencing torturous pain somehow rid us of the original sin we inherited from Adam &amp; Eve.  So I can see how, if you believe Jesus was God, that it would be moving. To think that such an almighty deity would willingly subject himself to all that pain.  My problem with the death on a cross, is that it logically makes no sense.  If you're God, just get rid of our original sin.  No crucifixion necessary.  And if you can send yourself in Jesus the Son™ form to Earth, perform miraculous acts of healing on people, and speak out against the hypocrisies of church you lead, then maybe that should be a full time position.  Maybe this awesome, humble, feet washing messiah could deign us worthy to take a break from all the hot babes &amp; gourmet food up in heaven, and keep an active presence in the world to remind people to be nice to each other and stuff.",™

t5_2vjk7,Applegravy,1365201025,"true, LG's Android phones haven't been great in the past, but the Nexus line is a standard for quality.  if they let HTC, which is horrible, make the first two, then the Nexus 4 is nowhere near as bad as it seems.  I've heard a lot of good things about it.  and the lack of Micro SD slot is because Google likes to push their cloud services.    as for battery life, [this thing is great no matter what phone you get.](http://www.amazon.com/Anker®-Astro3-10000mAh-Multi-voltage-Output/dp/B005NGKR54/)  however, if you need a phone off contract and don't want the Nexus 4, I suggest looking for some phones by [Blu](http://bluproducts.com/new-models).  this phone, for example, the [Blu Tank 4.5](http://bluproducts.com/pro-detail/tank45) has Jelly Bean, a dual-core CPU, and is also waterproof and scratch-resistant.  and for only about $200.  ([Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.com/Unlocked-Dual-Core-Processor-Waterproof-Protection/dp/B00B7NAXS8))  Blu has very decent, unlocked phones for very cheap.  more around the price a phone really should be off contract.

t5_2qhc5,kbrugger,1365201997,"It's not really a problem of applying terms to existing terms. The mere act of applying a term to reality is creating a new description. Everytime you say ""spirit"" or ""spiritual"" you're trying to evoke something that is really unspeakable. As mysterious as it is, I wouldn't dare to talk about ""non-spirituality"". If you can't define spirit, yet you feel it, or more accurately: you feel and perceive as a spirit; then everything you have experienced, are experiencing and will experience will be an act of this same spirit. You ONLY know spirit. How could you define non-spirit?  When Watts (and many others) say that this ""nirvana"" is already there, they really mean it, it's already there in every living being. We're all spiritual beings, there can't be awareness without spirit. There is just a difference of lucidity. Some are more asleep than the others, some are specially awake.  I would just say that there are people who _know_ themselves as spiritual beings, and people who don't know _yet_ themselves. Those who don't know (yet) are constantly fighting to ""free"" from themselves, and since it's impossible to do so, they are trapped in loops, like they're dreaming.  I like the word you use, ""empowerment"", because spirit is a power, in fact it is The Power™, so being aware of the connection naturally empowers you, and the intent to get accessible to power naturally shows you that connection.  Someone once told me this: ""zen is not a path, it is a field"".",™

t5_2qh2p,paulhoward1,1365203903,"  ***I Corinthians- Chapter 7,  verse 2 ; Jude- Verses 6,7,8,15,18,23*** For the disdain and the outright blasphemy that you exhibit and display through your UNGODLY and UNHOLY lifestyle,practice and conduct of homosexual activities and all gay and lesbian activities associated with all who do maintain that disgusting lifestyle that is continually forced upon all those who believe and defend the ONE AND ONLY GOD ORDAINED RELATIONSHIP CALLED THE MARRIAGE OF ONE MAN TO ONE WOMAN,the non-denominational christian band  SURRENDER has a forth coming demo single soon to be released called,""Livin' Outside of God's Word"". Listen closely,for the battle has yet to begin. Up to this time ,the homosexual has met little or no resistance. That is until NOW. No longer will your activities be acknowledged without confrontation and resistance through prayer and faith in Jesus Christ(James 5:16-The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much).  Read my lips! The only hatred being exhibited is your denial of the HOLY WORD OF GOD,which absolutely opposes your vial,degenerative,and despicable, and 100% unholy lifestyle. Again,read my lips,you were not born this way! You in your own satanic and demonic minds have chosen that way!! In the process,HOLY and LOVING GOD,who will not be mocked,has given you over to reprobate hearts and minds.In essence,HE is toying with you. You despise the HOLY WORD OF GOD so much that you will even oppose one of his greatest creations ever-the love of one man for one woman!!! Your condemnation is close at hand. Do not seek my LORD AND SAVIOR,JESUS THE CHRIST,THE ONE AND ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD!! HE will laugh you to scorn and require your repentance and remittance of sin. But as William Shakespeare once said,""All the world's a stage,and we are merely players"". THE LORD OF HOSTS already knows you will not abandon your disobedience. So,gird yourselves. Actions come with a price. SURRENDER will no longer sit back and remain quiet. Your path of least resistance is over. WE will confront you and all those who agree,aide and abet you with strong faith,powerful prayer and a vocal presence that will be heard from HEAVEN to your final resting place-hell,that is,if you remain in opposition to GOD ALMIGHTY. Until then,gird yourselves. The battle has only begun. Be sure that your beliefs will find you out. And more importantly, I pray in the name of my LORD AND SAVIOR,JESUS THE CHRIST,that HE and HE alone will make an outward mockery and  showing of  your UNHOLY and vile lifestyles and existence; that HE will do to you as was done to the homosexuals in Sodom; that your satanic joy for your reprobate lifestyles will soon be turned to devastating mourning and grief for you opposition to the ONE AND ONLY GOD BLESSED AND ORDAINED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS PLANET: ONE MAN TO ONE WOMAN,which culminates in the marriage of one man to one woman!!!!!!!!!!  To all homosexuals,in CHRIST JESUS' HOLY NAME,I pray your demise to be swift and complete,as well as all those who aide and abet you. We do not represent any religious organization or denomination. Any opinions expressed are solely those of the lead singer and founder of the band,""SURRENDER"".for which no apologies will be made or accepted!!! GOD's word prevails no matter what decision ANY court declares,and HE does rule in the kingdom of men.Your disobedience to HIS word will only cloak you in the wrath of HIS justice! ""For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.""

t5_2qhn3,BumpyNella,1365210291,"Well, you certainly know the challenge: accept others the way they are, warts and all, or...  what? Create stronger boundaries to protect yourself? Most folks probably have to do this with family anyway.   You know that you are powerless to change other people, places, and things. But you may need to have strong boundaries if you're feeling negatively affected by others. Sorry I don't have an active link for the essay below, but maybe it can help.  It is good that you are listening to your head *and* your heart on this. I wish you the best.  Never mind, [here's the link] (http://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/707/show-page/159/home-study-courses.html), but I pasted the text below anyway.  WHAT IS A BOUNDARY? By Margaret Paul, Ph.D.  My clients often explain to me how they set a boundary. They tell me something like, ""I set a boundary. I told him he has to stop putting me down in public,"" or ""I set a boundary. I told her she has to be on time from now on,"" or ""I set a boundary. I told him he has to stop being critical of me.""  This is not a boundary. A boundary is not about telling another person what to do. It is about telling another person what YOU will do in the face of the other's continued unkind or undesirable behavior. While it is hard for most people to accept, we cannot control another's behavior. What we can control is our own response in the face of others' behavior.  A boundary is about telling your truth and taking action on it. For example:  ""I'm no longer willing to be with you in public when you put me down. The next time you do that, I will announce to everyone that I'm unwilling to be put down by you any more. Then I will leave and take the car or a cab home.""  ""I'm no longer willing to be late to events because of you being late. The next time you are late, I will leave without you. If you continue to be late, then I will just plan on taking separate cars.""  ""Your constant criticisms feel awful to me. From now on, when you are critical, I will tell you that it feels awful and leave the room.""  Then, of course, you have to take the action you have said you would take. If you do not take the action, then what you have said is a manipulation rather than a truth. A boundary means nothing until you are willing to take the action.  The tricky part of this has to do with your intent. If your intent is to control the other person rather than take loving care of yourself, then your statement and action is just another form of control. If your desire is to take responsibility for yourself, then your tone of voice will be calm and matter-of-fact just letting the other person know what you will be doing or are doing. If your desire is to control the other person, then your tone of voice will be angry, blaming, and accusing, and your energy will be hard and closed.  We cannot hide our intent it will always come through in our energy and our tone of voice. However you might try to mask an intent to control, the other will always pick up on it and probably react to it with his or her own controlling behavior.  You are coming from a place of personal power when your intent is to take loving care of yourself rather than control the other. Since you cannot ultimately control another, trying to will leave you feeling frustrated and powerless.  The challenging part of this is taking the loving action on your own behalf. In order to take loving care of yourself, you need to be willing to let go of the outcome regarding how the other person will feel and behave. If you are focused on controlling how the other person will feel in the face of your actions, then you will not be able to take the loving action. If your focus is on the other person, such as, ""He will feel hurt and angry if I leave the party,"" or ""She will be furious with me if I leave without her,"" or ""He will feel rejected and tell me I am running away from conflict if I leave the room when he is critical,"" then you will be unable to take the loving action.  Only if you are in compassion for yourself will you be able to act on your own behalf. Compassion for yourself means that you are 100% willing to take responsibility for your own feelings rather than trying to get someone else to do it for you, or rather than trying to control another's feelings. It means that you are willing for the other person to be upset with you rather than continue to be treated unkindly.  People tend to mirror how we treat ourselves. If you tolerate unkind treatment, you are letting others know that it is okay to treat you badly. By taking loving care of yourself in the face of others' unkind behavior, you will find that generally others will respect you and treat you well.

t5_2cneq,SatiricProtest2,1365219493,"WRONG. THERE IT IS A MONSANTO PROTECTION ACT.   [The supreme court decided in 2010 that Genetically engineered GMO plants are subject to regulation by APHIS](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-475.ZS.html) as [""plant pest""](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-usc-cite/7/7711/a) Environmental Impact study must be done to continue to keep GMO plants, in this case GMO Alfalfa, classified as a plant pest.   Which is how the ""Monsanto Protection Act"" fits into place, which prohibits the Department of Agriculture from stopping production of any crop once it’s in the ground. Which allows farmers to keep growing crops that they've already planted while the crop is pending review.   So if Farmer decides to plant GMO Alfalfa, then while APHIS sues under the Plant Protection Act, the GMO Alfalfa crop can continue to grow instead of being destroyed as the Department of Agriculture used to be able to do.   GMO Alfalfa is herbicide resistant or as Monsanto calls it Roundup Ready  Which brings up several question based on different scenarios.   * If the court case is still pending will the Farmer be able to harvest and sell his crop?  * Since the Crop will still be growing while the ""courts"" decide there is the possibility of cross pollination.      * With this possibility of Cross pollination will Monsanto sue farmers based on the precedent set forth by [Bowman V Monsanto](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/11-796) Where         * Bowman also bought seeds from a local commodity seed provider and planted a second crop; harvesting seeds from his second crops to use to replant his second crop the next year         * the local provider were herbicide resistant         * Upon confirmation that Bowman’s second crops, grown from second-generation and commodity seeds, displayed herbicide resistance, Monsanto sued him for patent infringement.          * Bowman lost to Monsanto which opens the possibility to sue farmers who use Monsanto's Patents         * [Monsanto authorizes growers to sell second-generation seeds to local grain elevators as commodity, without requiring growers to place restriction on grain elevators subsequent sales of that sead.](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf)      * The chance of other plants like weeds picking up the herbicide gene, will Monsanto be forced to pay for it removal when herbicides dont work?  [On January 27, 2011, APHIS announced its decision to grant nonregulated status for alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide commercially known as Roundup.

[The supreme court decided in 2010 that Genetically engineered GMO plants are subject to regulation by APHIS](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-475.ZS.html) as [""plant pest""](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-usc-cite/7/7711/a) Environmental Impact study must be done to continue to keep GMO plants, in this case GMO Alfalfa, classified as a plant pest.   Which is how the ""Monsanto Protection Act"" fits into place, which prohibits the Department of Agriculture from stopping production of any crop once it’s in the ground. Which allows farmers to keep growing crops that they've already planted while the crop is pending review.   So if Farmer decides to plant GMO Alfalfa, then while APHIS sues under the Plant Protection Act, the GMO Alfalfa crop can continue to grow instead of being destroyed as the Department of Agriculture used to be able to do.   GMO Alfalfa is herbicide resistant or as Monsanto calls it Roundup Ready  Which brings up several question based on different scenarios.   * If the court case is still pending will the Farmer be able to harvest and sell his crop?  * Since the Crop will still be growing while the ""courts"" decide there is the possibility of cross pollination.      * With this possibility of Cross pollination will Monsanto sue farmers based on the precedent set forth by [Bowman V Monsanto](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/11-796) Where         * Bowman also bought seeds from a local commodity seed provider and planted a second crop; harvesting seeds from his second crops to use to replant his second crop the next year         * the local provider were herbicide resistant         * Upon confirmation that Bowman’s second crops, grown from second-generation and commodity seeds, displayed herbicide resistance, Monsanto sued him for patent infringement.          * Bowman lost to Monsanto which opens the possibility to sue farmers who use Monsanto's Patents         * [Monsanto authorizes growers to sell second-generation seeds to local grain elevators as commodity, without requiring growers to place restriction on grain elevators subsequent sales of that seed.](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf)      * The chance of other plants like weeds picking up the herbicide gene, will Monsanto be forced to pay for it removal when herbicides dont work?  [On January 27, 2011, APHIS announced its decision to grant nonregulated status for alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide commercially known as Roundup. The final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Roundup Ready® Alfalfa (RR alfalfa) was published on December 23, 2010.](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/alfalfa.shtml)  Which Protects Monsanto because  [Any still pending lawsuits against APHIS against its GMO classification wont prevent GMO Alfalfa from being planted. Which then gives GMO Alfalfa a chance to cross pollinate while the lawsuits are still being decided by the courts. ](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-24/monsanto-roundup-ready-alfalfa-should-be-blocked-court-told)  If its still being decided by the courts will a Farmer be able to sell his crops at harvest time?

Edit in a screencap of what you were saying that caused the ban, it is not available, and replace ""www"" with ""np"" to conform with our submission guidelines. Then reply to me when it is fixed and I or another mod will reapprove it.  You should try to give a full honest assessment of bans and shadowbans you have received, especially if you have received shadowbans after posting in /r/politics.  I know of at least one redditor who received a ""trap"" shadowban there four months or so ago, I never went public with it because the redditor was lazy and also not a great candidate for bitching and moaning about it - cause he was generally rude.  Distinguished part only applies to the above.  ___ Without more, silencing a critic of /u/davidreiss666 by backing this ban and removing comments means /r/politics mods would technically have to remove all of /r/canada, and most of /r/subredditdrama as well.  That guy has a pretty well deserved reputation for being a dick, he seemed nice and all to us at first, and I didn't believe it until our subreddit experienced it first hand. It's tough - if someone told me /r/robotevil was a dick, and robot was in fact a dick (which is impossible, btw, like calling Xxtra-Flamin' Hot Brand Flavor® Cheetos not delicious) then I would probably side with robot because I know him. But that wouldn't mean he's not still a dick.  Actually, I do hang out with dicks a lot, and they are total dicks. I must have dicks on the brain. Anyway, I would love if they gave you a break? You're one of the only anti-gun violence guys in that thread. That thread is being pummeled by tnelson, logical, etc. And tossing out one of the only good guys because he has a beef with a mod who for all intents and purposes most redditors hate for being a dick anyway seems arbitrary, although I don't know the history.  Well. I say cut this guy a break, I didn't see a bannable offense in that thread. I'm sure there's history here, but people are tricked or reported by vindictive users for shadowbans all the time. I have fanatical gun users after me for four months, so I know the feeling. Bans in /r/politics are arbitrary and not well defined, and ambiguity makes it rife for over-modding.  They are also par for the course for commenting there, I got one for merely reporting brigading to the mods there.  Both sides probably complain about it, but banning one anti-gun proliferation redditor equals 10-20 /r/progun redditors - no lie. You obviously have a target on your back.  The mods are after you there so you need to switch to an alt.  Even if they let you back in, /u/davidreiss666 or another mod may report you for a shadowban down the road on that account, they have done it to people before just to be vindictive.  Cheers.",®

t5_2r6rj,CyberToyger,1365278143,"&gt;violence against women act  You don't see the problem here, right off the bat? Violence Against *Women* Act (1994). Not only is the sexism right in the title, but it actually replaced a gender neutral act: the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (1984). VAWA increased funding for women's shelters and redefined parameters for funding:  ""(a) REQUEST FOR CONTRACT- The Attorney General shall request the National Academy of Sciences, through its National Research Council, to enter into a contract to **develop a research agenda to increase the understanding and control of violence against women, including rape and domestic violence**. In furtherance of the contract, the National Academy shall convene a panel of nationally recognized **experts on violence against women**,.. ""  &gt;beyond that, feminist organizations don't write bills, i'm pretty sure that's for the government (you know, the one that's over 80% male) to do  ""**The Feminist Majority has also been a leader in legislative victories** for women, including amending the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to provide for monetary damages to women who win sexual harassment and sex discrimination lawsuits in court; winning passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the Violence Against Women Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, in 1994; passing the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, in 1996..""  So now, why aren't they doing anything for men as that phony feel-good list on Jezebel/the redhead in the video read off of, implies they care about?  And what does percentage of government being male have to do with anything? You DO realize that half the voting population is women and therefore women are half responsible for the people who make it into office, right? It's not like all these ""evil menz!"" just waltz into office via the power of ""Patriarchy™"".  &gt;putting an end to child support is less pro-male and more anti-child though i think  No. Ending child support is pro-male as far more men are forced to pay child support than women, first of all, and second of all, because child support isn't always even used for the children. Not one state in the US requires recipients of child support to actually prove that the amounts received are 1) necessary to meet the children's needs, or, 2) are actually spent on the children. It's not about the children, it's about allowing the woman to maintain her current standard of living despite severing all other ties with the man.  &gt;it's just the case that women tend not to abandon their children as readily as men do.  No, the courts give women primary and sole custody frequently because they paint the husband as either abusive or unfit to be a parent. Women are the one who initiate almost 80% of divorces, and they seek sole custody in order to get that child support payment, rather than joint custody. Believe it or not, only 15% of divorced fathers willingly relinquish custody and visitation rights. As it turns out, men aren't emotionless robots who magically become unattached to the children they wanted to bring into this world just because they don't get along with their wife anymore.  &gt;with increasingly diminished timetables and opportunities to enact the right to medical autonomy  Because we're finding out that human beings become human beings earlier than originally thought. The timetables aren't going to get any more diminished than they already are, and the reason they exist is so that we don't wind up killing off a living thing with self-awareness and the ability to feel things. As far as abortion is concerned, I wish it'd only be used if the mother is too young or if it would prevent her from dying in childbirth, but for the time being I'd rather it not be illegal. I would like to see current technology such as the artificial womb become 100% viable, so that if a woman did become pregnant without meaning to, the egg could be gently removed and grown in the artificial womb, making abortion obsolete.  &gt;or that domestic violence against men shouldn't be addressed  False. Not just counting the Feminists on several subreddits and the Feminists on Tumblr, but several I've talked to in person have downplayed everything from domestic violence against males, to female on male rape, to false rape accusations.  &gt;but you're the one getting hostile and dismissive of feminist organizations, right?  When a collective that's existed for over 50 years and resulted in the passing of lopsided legislation in favor of women, at the taxpayer's expense, pretends to give a damn about men and simply blames everything on the invisible force known as 'Patriarchy', you can guarantee there will be a nominal number of men who are hostile and dismissive of empty claims made on behalf of a less-than-benevolent institution.",™

t5_2qh6c,missssghost,1365282487,"There's a lot to respond to here. Sorry if this turns out really jumbled ~  Firstly, I think it's normal to go through moments were you fear the end. Existence is all we know and to think about a time when you won't exist is kind of impossible, incomprehensible and can be really terrifying. If life after death doesn't exist, that non-existence won't *feel* any different than what you *felt* before you were conceived/born.   The universe existed long before we were born and will keep existing (hopefully for the ones left!) for a very long time after we pass away.  Coming to terms with our mortality is incredibly difficult. It's something I've more or less accepted at this point in my life, but of course I don't want to die - mostly because there is so much I want to live for.   Try and focus on the positives if you can. I definitely understand that this can be difficult though if you are a depressive person (I am too, and went through the worst depression during highschool/early university).   If you are only trying to convince yourself that Christianity (or any other religion) is true purely because you don't want to fear the afterlife, I honestly don't think that will work.   It's kind of a superficial reason to believe - but if you think it will make your anxieties recede, try reading the Bible and examine whether that's something you believe is true. Pray, meditate, educate yourself. From what I glean from Christianity, it is that nothing you have done in the past is bad enough for Christ to turn his back on you.   Whether or not you can convince yourself that Christianity is true, it sounds like you are having an existential crisis.   It's a good thing to evaluate one's life, even at the tender age of 19. What do you want to do with your time? Are you doing productive things? Are you working towards self improvement? Are you trying to be a good person? Are you being self-destructive?   All questions you can pose and investigate no matter what your p.o.v. on gods/religion.   You may also want to look into speaking to a therapist (at school it's offered) if your anxieties are out of control.     Be kind to yourself ♥ ",♥

If you really want a high end card the quadro k4000 is quite the card. **These are not video gaming cards**, however the software you listed if done right can be accelerated with GPU's and so I strongly recommend not over looking professional graphics cards. And easily be able to run the small spec games you mentioned.  * The rest of the stuff is pretty standard. If 16gb of ram is not enough you can upgrade on that board up to 64Gb which isn't to shabby.   EDIT: 1k-1.5k does not get you far in the workstation environment so I did have to go slightly over the 1k mentioned but I hope this give you a good start. ",®

t5_2qhk3,CyberToyger,1365294240,"No. We don't want to work with Feminists, we are however willing to work with Women's Rights Advocates.   ""But Toyger, aren't they the same thing?!""  Well I'm glad you asked! And the short answer is, *no, they're not!~*.  You see, a Feminist is a subscriber to the ideology that all of womens problems branch from men and the ever-elusive Patriarchy™. Rather than taking a look at an actual history book, they consume rhetoric-ready liberal extremist writings and interpretations of history. For example, rather than learning that men weren't born with the ""privilege"" of voting and had to sign up for military service in order to get the chance to vote (and often didn't get to utilize that right to vote if they were killed, kicked out, or were a Conscientious Objector), instead they're taught and believe that all the evul menz kept women locked away at home and simply flashed their privilege at the voting booth in exchange for a voting ballot.  Women's Rights Advocates on the other hand tend to see reality for what it is, and rather than blaming men or patriarchy, they point out the exact problems as they exist. For example, female genital mutilation in 3rd world countries and abortion are two of the most recent and important subjects for any WRA. While there is some overlap with Feminists in these areas, WRA's are more focused on raising awareness of FGM and fighting for the ability/right to do with their own body as they see fit, without bringing up any Patriarchy nonsense. Also, many WRA's see no problem with the gender of politicians but rather they recognize that the actual problem is having Authoritarian politicians who want to control people and what people do with their own bodies. Feminists are the first to notice extraneous circumstances such as the gender of politicians, without even taking facts into consideration such as -- gender has little to nothing to do with laws in comparison to overall ideology (authoritarian v.s. freedom-oriented), and they fail to recognize that 50% of the population is women and have the power to vote in female candidates.  That's the basic overview anyway. I will gladly work with WRA's and other Egalitarian groups to correct real problems caused by laws (as opposed to straw-problems like 'Wage gap') as well as educating the society on how to treat everyone equally and to put judges &amp; cops in place who aren't interest-serving or sexist/racist/etc.",™

t5_2s7aw,HorseFD,1365296325,"&gt; Either that or the whole ""too many cooks spoil the broth"", what with them advertising many many big(?) names coming onto the project.  They've actually written about this in one of the Kickstarter updates.  &gt; A few of you have asked whether we're bringing too many writers on the project. Will it be difficult to manage? How will they all agree? Rest assured that more writers only helps us. Colin is in charge of the overall story, and will define the constraints required for each area to connect with the larger story. Each writer will then have one or more specific areas (and/or companions in some cases) to flesh out. There will be considerable creative freedom, especially for areas that are less central to the core storyline, but the result will be a cohesive whole.  &gt; We’re also developing conventions that all writers will follow, ensuring consistency in design and also how the Ninth World setting is conveyed. These will include writing style conventions, though not any so rigid as to constrain each writer’s talents.  &gt; The result is a very modular design, with a single creative lead to make sure everything ties together (and having Chris Avellone review the creative elements will only strengthen the vision). Managing a team of writers is how many story-driven RPGs are made, including Planescape™: Torment. Chris Avellone was the lead on PS:T, but there were seven designers working with him to make the game as deep and rich as it was. We’ll be following the same approach on Torment, as well as having Ray Vallese as a dedicated editor to further bolster consistency.",™

A single topical (local) dose should be sufficient; if not, repeat in 30 days. Revolution kills adult fleas and prevents eggs from hatching by entering the bloodstream and spreading to sebaceous glands found below the skin's surface.[5] It is also effective against several types of mites and ticks.  &gt; imidacloprid: Advantage® - Bayer, one single kitten dose application is generally sufficient to remove the fleas. If this is not the case, the treatment can be repeated after 30 days. The vapors of this product can lead to irritation of the eyes; it is thus recommended to aerate the room where the rabbit lives in. There have been some deaths reported, but they have not been directly attributed to Advantage.[3] Advantage should not be used for very young (&lt;6 months), elderly (6+ years), or compromised rabbits.  &gt; lufenuron: Program® - Novartis, 10 mg/kg. One sole treatment should be sufficient. If not, the treatment can be repeated after 30 days. Program is an oral chitin inhibitor and keeps new eggs from hatching. However, it does not affect adult fleas, so other treatments will be needed to control severe infestations.  I think the most common medication people use in the US are either Revolution or Advantage.",®

t5_2qhk3,Extra_MSG,1365312589,"McDowell's study was conducted under the auspices of the U.S government, and therefore had no reason to be published by a peer reviewed journal. Since you reject it on those grounds, I am going to request that you post no information generated by a non-peer-reviewed source, unless it can be independently verified. (You suggested the rule, so you will, of course, oblige the board by adhering to it).     In regards to independent verification and your failure to find corroboration of the journal 'Fornesic Science Digest"" using the search engine, Google: to my knowledge, no reasonable academic judges the validity of any particular datum according to whether they can find it cross-referenced on Google. Any electronic method is hardly a definitive source, though next time you may wish to try Google Scholar instead **where there is contained for ""Forensic Science Digest"" a plethora of independently verifiable citations.**  I think you will generally find academic search engines are going to be much more useful for the high-standards you have set for yourself.   Incidentally, Kanin did indeed take his research from one department (as you pointed out) and the author of the chapter reflected that fact in his summary, (which I reproduced above, also) by the VERY CONSERVATIVE STATEMENT:   **The literature review just given demonstrates two things. First, investigators and forensic examiners are very likely to encounter a false report if they work sex crimes. Second, because of the dearth of literature and the limited investigative experience behind it, investigators and forensic examiners will be unprepared when this happens.**  There is nothing the least bit unscholarly about making such modest conclusions with the evidence presented.   You asked me to cite some studies regarding the effects of threats of false allegations, and also said you would genuinely love to read them. That's great. Here is a bibliography to get you started. It is far from exhaustive, but I do not want to overload you as I am sure you have other obligations over the next few days. Since you expressed a genuine interest in absorbing the corpus, though, this should get you going when you can spare a few hours this week. I am sure the forum will be interested in how you respond to the four studies I have listed. I believe they are all from peer-reviewed sources, and they reflect a number of different points of view. Let me know if I can forward a more extensive biblio once you get through these.  --- FALSE ALLEGATIONS OF RAPE  The Cambridge Law Journal The Cambridge Law Journal / Volume 65 / Issue 01 / March 2006,	 pp 128-158Copyright © Cambridge Law Journal and Contributors 2006 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0008197306007069 (About DOI), Published online: 19 April 2006  abstract:  THERE can be little doubt that the spectre of false rape allegations has significantly influenced the development of legal doctrine and its enforcement. The fear of false allegations has been used to justify evidential rules in cases involving sexual offences such as the corroboration warning, the retention of the marital rape immunity and continues to influence police and prosecutorial decision-making.  ---  Pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment  William O'Donohue, Adrian H. Bowers*  Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.  Abstract A sexual harassment allegation is either true or false. Whether specific allegations are true or false is important to questions of epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, administrative and legal proceedings, as well as the welfare of actual victims and innocent alleged perpetrators. It is naïve and harmful to operate with the heuristic: ‘All claims are true’. However, the truth of many allegations is very difficult to determine, particularly as is often the case when there are no witnesses, no conclusive hard evidence, and the presence of a situation where both parties have divergent accounts of the alleged occurrence. There has been little theoretical or empirical work on what would cause a person to make a false allegation of sexual harassment. This paper gives an overview of the intricacies associated with sexual harassment investigations and enumerates 14 possible pathways to false allegations: lying; borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified, investigative mistakes, and mistakes in determination of the degree of harassment.

t5_2sfmf,sheasie,1365317779,"**EDIT/PPS:  Firstly, no one ever says that ""GWB was dealing with Clinton's** ***economic*** **mess"".**  Secondly...  Reagan produced a strong economy by spending and taking the US into debt.  Clinton produced a strong economy and balanced the budget.  So yes, Reagan certainly deserves credit for producing a ""strong"" economy -- the wrong way.  **edit/ps.**  In all fairness, I shouldn't say that Reagan did it the ""wrong"" way.  But he certainly did it the ""easy"" way.  And while Clinton did balance the budget, I shouldn't say that he ""produced"" the strong economy.  In all fairness, America's then ""strong economy"" was more due to Reagan's risky policies still paying off ... IF you can recognize that it was due to Reagan's irresponsible fiscal policies (and yes,any time you balloon national debt, it's ***definitely irresponsible***) that enabled America to ""win the 'cold war'"", and secure definitive #1 political/economic power in the world.  As a result, America's strong, debt-driven consumer market was able to birth an all new ""personal computer &amp; software industry"" -- employing millions of people.  Bottom Line, Clinton was just riding the wave of economic growth due to seriously awesome business process efficiencies coming from the PC/software industry that was really making a significant impact on the broader US economy.  So while Reagan did it the ""easy"" way, Clinton just got ""lucky"" that **Reagan's gamble** was still paying off.  The Neocon/Cheney/BushJr.'s/Iraq gamble, on the other hand, is not paying off.  Not for America, at least.  (I hear it's done wonder's for the owners of oil, like Bush, Cheney &amp; the rest of the Halliburton shareholders -- not to mention the Saudi's, James Baker, etc. what's it now.. wow, $93.05 barrel... yikes.)  **""Mission Accomplished""™**  And it took Obama to kill Osama.",™

Although the active ingredient is not supposed to cross into the central nervous system of mammals, the number of rabbit deaths reported suggests this is not true for rabbits. While successful treatment with fipronil has been reported, since there have been multiple anecdotal reports of small or young rabbits with fatal poisoning, its use can no longer be recommended in rabbits.[10]  A quick google reveals the Sentry is a product with fiprinol.

t5_2qhwp,TaiVat,1365347135,"&gt;Except that those portrayals of women actively damage society's perception of women, demoting them from 'people' to 'objects of my fantasy'. What it is, is sexist.  Only if you're dumb enough to not be able to tell the difference between entertainment and reality. When playing an rpg most of us steal anything that isnt bolted down, are you dumb enough to believe that it actually influences us to steal or even think stealing is ok in real life? No my ""friend"", what it is is your personal bias being pushed by using buzzword excuses like hurr durr ""sexism/think of the children"".  &gt;Furthermore, ""my fantasy"" is not an excuse to 'play out' anything. If I want a game about going to the maternity ward and killing all the babies because it's My Fantasy™, it certainly doesn't justify the existence of such a game and I should probably have my head checked.  Again, you're an idiot if you really think that. People arent little angels and the vast majority have fantasies and urges that are unpleasant and something that cant be done in reality, that doesnt mean its somehow bad to play em out in a virtual consequence and victim free world. Notice how there are *tens of millions* of people who play games where you murder people, make outright genocide, including respected professionals - doctors, lawyers, businessmen, yet between 50 years ago when games didnt exist and now *nothing* in society has changed for the worse from people playing out these fantasies.",™

I do remember eating some and it felt odd as it went down, a little scratchy if you will. I attributed it to being full grilled chicken goodness and I was just being able to Taste the Fire®. I didn't think anything of this so I hung around the house for a bit and watched TV before deciding to take my sister to the mall so I could be a good uncle and buy Christmas gifts for her kids.   We get done shopping and my throat still feels weird. I get some lemonade and every time I swallow it's still scratchy as hell. I even try to eat and it's still scratchy. Well shit, something's wrong so we go home.   I get home and get a flashlight to try and get a look. I head to the bathroom mirror and take a look and oh shit, there's about a 1/4"" piece of bone stuck right in the back of my throat. I try to reach in with tweezers but nope. It's too far back. I have my sister and Mom take a look and i get ""Oh shit!"" both times. So yeah.... it's time go go to the ER.   I walk in nonchalantly, and sign in.  NAME - sixtninecoug  REASON FOR VISIT - Chicken bone stuck in throat.    Well, needless to say, I'm ushered in pretty quickly. I bet all of the people with colds and broken limbs were pretty pissed this fat guy with nothing seemingly wrong just waltzed in in front of them. Insurance! woot!   I go into the exam room and the conversation is basically like this -    NURSE - ""So it says you have a chicken bone in your throat??""   ME - ""Yup, sure do!""   NURSE - ""How long has it been in there? You seem awfully calm""   Me - "" I dunno, a couple hours by now I guess. It doesn't hurt or anything, but it's pretty scratchy.""   NURSE - ""Ok, let's take a look inside.......... HOLY SHIT!...... (laughter).....""   ME - (laughter as well)   another nurse walks past in the hallway   NURSE - ""Hey!!! (other nurse) come in here, you gotta take a look at this!!!""    Well fuck. I'm a goddamn sideshow attraction now. They both look, giggle and then the paperwork is filled out. I get sent to get some X-Rays done (I guess it was close to the tonsils, and they weren't sure how big it really was) then I'm sent to the back with another doctor. He then proceeds to extract the chicken bone with a set of huge Chicken Bone Extraction Tools® that I'm sure were made for just this task and all is well. I look at the removed bone and it was a bit longer than the 1/4"" I originally saw. It was in total right about an inch long, so it went in about 3/4"".   TL;DR - Getting some deep bone penetration turned me into a sideshow attraction for some nurses at the ER. ",®

t5_2rfxx,Xalerwons,1365364869,"* 1.What determines how many League Points I gain from winning a match? There are numerous factors, but these are the two major ones:  -œ–œ–The difficulty of the match: if matchmaking considered your opponents to be favored, youâ€™ll gain more League Points than normal if you pull off the upset. The opposite is also true. -œ–œ–The relative MMRs of the other players in your game: if the other competitors are generally higher in the standings than you, youâ€™ll gain more LP (and lose less from a loss), so that youâ€™ll generally trend upwards even with a 50/50 record. Duo-queuing, and statistics such as your KDA ratio, do not affect your League Point gain. Since your MMR determines the number of League Points youâ€™re awarded from a game, players who intentionally tank their ratings after reaching a new tier will find they progress toward the next division VERY slowly. Essentially, theyâ€™ll have to make back the MMR points that they intentionally dumped in order to make meaningful progress toward the next tier or division. There's a lot of complicated logic on the back end to prevent this sort of abuse, so itâ€™s always more effective to play legitimately.   * 2.I reached Divison 1 of my league, and I am not earning as many League Points as before. Why is this? When you enter a ranked game, you are matched with teammates and opponents based on your matchmaking rating (what used to be called Elo). It is expected that your matchmaking rating is about equal to other players in your League. If for some reason your matchmaking rating is below what is expected in your League, you will see League Point gains come much more slowly as you approach your Division 1 Series. Because League placement is now permanent, we have designed the system to ensure that a playerâ€™s matchmaking rating is high enough to ensure that you can consistently play at the level of the next tier. As long as you continue to win more than you lose, your League Point gain will even out and youâ€™ll reach the Promotion Series.  It is possible to earn 0 League Points if your MMR is too low to qualify for the next tier.   * 3.What happens if I lose a ranked match in the league system? Losing a ranked game in the league system will cost some of your League Points. If youâ€™re already at the bottom of your division, this may mean falling back to the previous division . Once you've earned a skill tier, however, you can never be demoted to the previous tier unless you stop playing for a prolonged period of time.  In other words, losing can never cause you to fall below 0 League Points in the lowest division of your league.   * 4.What happens to my accumulated League Points if Iâ€™m defeated in a Division or Promotion Series? Youâ€™ll lose League Points relative to how you performed in the series. Youâ€™ll generally find yourself somewhere between 60-90 points following an unsuccessful series.   * 5.Does KDA have any influence on the amount of League Points I gain/lose? No.   * 6.Do I gain less/more League Points if I am duo-queueing? No. LP calculations are made individually based on your standing, MMR, and match difficulty.   * 7.I played my Division Series and was promoted two divisions instead of one. Why did this happen? When going through a promotion, a player's hidden matchmaking rating is also factored into the equation. If your hidden matchmaking rating is very high when you reach your advancement series, you may be promoted more than one division at a time. This is to ensure that players are always playing with others of the appropriate skill level, and to prevent a poor matchmaking experience by placing players in a division with others who hold a much lower hidden matchmaking rating.",™

Source  Dino Ferrari Centre, Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Milan, IRCCS Foundation Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. Abstract  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating genetic motoneuron disease leading to infant death. No effective therapy is currently available. It has been suggested that β-lactam antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may offer neuroprotection in motoneuron diseases. Here, we investigate the therapeutic effect of ceftriaxone in a murine model of SMA. Treated animals present a modest, but significant ameliorated neuromuscular phenotype and increased survival, which correlate with protection of neuromuscular units. Whole gene expression profiling in treated mice demonstrates modifications in several genes including those involved in RNA metabolism toward wild-type. The neuroprotective effect seems to be mediated by multiple mechanisms that encompass the increase of the glutamate transporter Glt1, the transcription factor Nrf2, as well as SMN protein. This study provides the first evidence of a potential positive effect of this class of molecules in SMA. Further investigation of analogs with increased and more specific therapeutic effects warrants the development of useful therapies for SMA.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is to ensure that players are always playing with others of the appropriate skill level, and to prevent a poor matchmaking experience by placing players in a division with others who hold a much lower hidden matchmaking rating.

I don't think the Federal government had anything to do with it, though, so I'm not quite sure how the 1st Amendment is applicable here. Maybe you could show me the law the Congress passed abridging your right to free speech?  &gt;The armed security guard did nothing to stop them from going into Columbine. He and the cop that shot at them tried to shoot after they were already on school property and doing damage.  So having a security guard at Aurora and Newtown would have been necessarily different how, exactly?  &gt;""Every illegal gun started out as a legal one""  &gt;Sure thing buddy! That just made my day knowing that you truly believe that.  So which gun manufacturers are marketing directly to criminals?  &gt;So because the shooting was at a Burger King and not a school, that circumstance... doesn't count?  No, it doesn't count as a *shooting* because the perpetrator didn't even draw his weapon.  Brandishing is hardly the same thing as a mass shooting.  We're really having trouble with definitions here, aren't we?  Let's go through a few more of these:  Pearl High School: Good Guy with a Gun™ principal stopped the shooter in the parking lot as he was trying to escape; hardly stopping a shooting in progress.  Appalachian Law: Good Guys with a Guns™ didn't show up until the shooter was leaving, having expended all his ammo, and according to some reports actually had little or nothing to do with his apprehension.  New Life Church: The woman who stopped the shooter was a security guard at the church, and churches in the area were on alert after an attack by the shooter elsewhere that day.  You could use this as an example that armed guards are sometimes effective, but an armed guard isn't a civilian. More problems with definitions.  Santa Clara gun range: You linked a freeper post that has a dead link as its source, and a google of the headline and date just brings up the same freerepublic link, a link to a gun blog citing freerepublic, and the ever popular white-supremacist stormfront.org.  Was there any actual news coverage for this?  And the last one is another armed robbery gone bad.  Also, the criminal was only stopped when he was reloading, but of course magazine restrictions won't really make any difference, right?  I'm just waiting for the example, where as you said,   &gt;Now if that maniac comes to your home-town mall and starts killing everyone, I'm sure you'll still hate me when I pull my gun out and save your life!

Def loved the Pink Rathian's new front bite with damning FLAMES!!  ♥ Coming from Unite and a little bit of 3rd port, def loved the Moga Village and the RP system. So tired of getting eggs/etc for Pokke points. Now, I can slay till my heart's content and upgrade the village. Killing the large monster for the day and 2 randoms is the best! Lava nuggets are OP though hehehe.. currently at 35k RP.  ♥ The Shakalalas w/ different masks, abilities, and dances really makes em useful. I wish the cats were like this...  ♥ Loved the challenge of the water battles. The no charge forward swing for the hammer helps me with this.  ♥ The variety of Monsters and their move set/s. In comparison to Unite, some monsters were mere re-skins + new moves. Ex: Kut-ku -&gt; Qypceros -&gt; Yian Garuga -&gt; Rathian -&gt; Rathalos comes to mind.  ♥ Loved the changes that they made for the Hammer since 3rd port but loved it more on Ultimate. LS was my go to on 3rd Port.  ♥ The graphics. Revisiting the Misty Peaks and going to area 7 for the scenery: priceless. Seems polished compared to MH on PSP.  ♥ No more clawing!! FUCK YEAH!!!",♥

This opens a new rule for an allotted period of time. Straight ejections and Flagrant 2's incur the unlocking of two *Trapcards*™ at once.  Further techs stack effects and durations (unless they contradict eachother in which case, the *Trapcard*™ currently in play is deemed *null*).  **Example Scenario**:  Spurs have a 21 point lead over the Bobcats. Popovic creeps up the sideline, laughing maniacally at Kemba Walker  after airballing another three. Ol' Mate Joey Crawford isn't having a bar of it and calls a T in Pop's grill.  This unlocks the Bobcats' *Trapcard*™ which calls for only players below 6'5"" to be on the court for the next 5 minutes or until the end of the quarter, whichever comes first.   Pop scoffs angrily and kicks the poor mopboy.  This earns another tech, an early shower and the Bobcats' second *Trapcard*™ is unveiled. The paint is now lava and any player caught touching it will be forced to the bench until the next out of play.   The duration of 5 minutes is added onto the original *Trapcard*™ and now we have 10 guards battling it out in a game where you cannot set foot in the paint.",™

(Photo by Suzanne Tylander © 2012) This particular photo represents an emotional moment rarely caught underwater. This particular diver was expected to win the entire event. The diver knew as soon as he hit the water his form was flawed and that he might have just lost it all. I was fortunate enough to witness this moment as it was unfolding underwater. I captured the sequence of emotion just a split second after he hit the water and began to sink to the bottom with a sense of defeat written in his body language This was the image I chose from the series. I have felt this emotion and disappointment before as many athletes do. My chance to capture it underwater was rare but beautiful.

t5_2rfxx,Xalerwons,1365426236,"* 1.What determines how many League Points I gain from winning a match? There are numerous factors, but these are the two major ones:  -œ–œ–The difficulty of the match: if matchmaking considered your opponents to be favored, youâ€™ll gain more League Points than normal if you pull off the upset. The opposite is also true. -œ–œ–The relative MMRs of the other players in your game: if the other competitors are generally higher in the standings than you, youâ€™ll gain more LP (and lose less from a loss), so that youâ€™ll generally trend upwards even with a 50/50 record. Duo-queuing, and statistics such as your KDA ratio, do not affect your League Point gain. Since your MMR determines the number of League Points youâ€™re awarded from a game, players who intentionally tank their ratings after reaching a new tier will find they progress toward the next division VERY slowly. Essentially, theyâ€™ll have to make back the MMR points that they intentionally dumped in order to make meaningful progress toward the next tier or division. There's a lot of complicated logic on the back end to prevent this sort of abuse, so itâ€™s always more effective to play legitimately.   * 2.I reached Divison 1 of my league, and I am not earning as many League Points as before. Why is this? When you enter a ranked game, you are matched with teammates and opponents based on your matchmaking rating (what used to be called Elo). It is expected that your matchmaking rating is about equal to other players in your League. If for some reason your matchmaking rating is below what is expected in your League, you will see League Point gains come much more slowly as you approach your Division 1 Series. Because League placement is now permanent, we have designed the system to ensure that a playerâ€™s matchmaking rating is high enough to ensure that you can consistently play at the level of the next tier. As long as you continue to win more than you lose, your League Point gain will even out and youâ€™ll reach the Promotion Series.  It is possible to earn 0 League Points if your MMR is too low to qualify for the next tier.   * 3.What happens if I lose a ranked match in the league system? Losing a ranked game in the league system will cost some of your League Points. If youâ€™re already at the bottom of your division, this may mean falling back to the previous division . Once you've earned a skill tier, however, you can never be demoted to the previous tier unless you stop playing for a prolonged period of time.  In other words, losing can never cause you to fall below 0 League Points in the lowest division of your league.   * 4.What happens to my accumulated League Points if Iâ€™m defeated in a Division or Promotion Series? Youâ€™ll lose League Points relative to how you performed in the series. Youâ€™ll generally find yourself somewhere between 60-90 points following an unsuccessful series.   * 5.Does KDA have any influence on the amount of League Points I gain/lose? No.   * 6.Do I gain less/more League Points if I am duo-queueing? No. LP calculations are made individually based on your standing, MMR, and match difficulty.   * 7.I played my Division Series and was promoted two divisions instead of one. Why did this happen? When going through a promotion, a player's hidden matchmaking rating is also factored into the equation. If your hidden matchmaking rating is very high when you reach your advancement series, you may be promoted more than one division at a time. This is to ensure that players are always playing with others of the appropriate skill level, and to prevent a poor matchmaking experience by placing players in a division with others who hold a much lower hidden matchmaking rating.",™

Where the friends of man and woman do run,  When their time on earth is over and done.  For here, between this world and the next,  Is a place where each beloved creature finds rest.  On this golden land, they wait and they play,  Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.  No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness,  For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness.  Their limbs are restored, their health renewed,  Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.  They romp through the grass, without even a care,  Until one day they start, and sniff at the air.  All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back,  Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.  For just at that instant, their eyes have met;  Together again, both person and pet.  So they run to each other, these friends from long past,  The time of their parting is over at last.  The sadness they felt while they were apart,  Has turned into joy once more in each heart.  They embrace with a love that will last forever,  And then, side-by-side, they cross over… together. © 1998 Steve and Diane Bodofsky. All Rights Reserved.",©

So I hung up, called back &amp; told him I had  ""*the flu*""  &amp; he happily gave me the week off &amp; told me he hoped that I would feel better soon (I believe he meant emotionally since he knew I was fine), &amp; to call him when I was ready to come back.

[as in I don't think you go to MAKS and do this if you're worried about your plane's handling.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKj-gX7Q2X8)  &gt;The program projects utilization rates for the two processors that support the panoramic cockpit display to be greater than 100 percent when assessed against Block 3 capabilities. The program initiated plans to optimize the core processor software to reduce these rates.  Greater than 100%. That's bad right?   &gt;An example where maintainability needs to improve is engine replacement. One unscheduled engine removal and replacement occurred during the OUE, which required 39 hours of elapsed maintenance time. For the five unscheduled engine removal and replacements that have occurred in the F-35A fleet, **the mean elapsed maintenance time for this task is 52 hours.** The ORD threshold is for a maximum crew of four maintainers to remove and install the engine **within 120 minutes**.[Source p37 Feb 2013 .pdf](http://pogoarchives.org/straus/ote-info-memo-20130215.pdf)  &gt;Testing on a testbed versus the fighter makes no difference - if the system works, then it works.   WRONG. Only testing in the platform it is going to be deployed in counts, because only there will the problems show themselves. Proof of concept on a testbed is fine and dandy, but it is NOT the same as getting it to work on the plane itself. I don't know what it is... you're not keen on the possibility of the Russians making something decent? You don't think that slowly, incrementally improving their OLS over decades has left them with a working sensor? I hear you that EO DAS will have 360 degree coverage and that will be great. That doesn't change the reputed development of the OLS-50. Considering the long history Sukhoi have working with their OLS' it would be churlish to bet that they can't (or haven't) made it work yet. You think they only woke up yesterday and thought... Hell... let's give our OLS 360 degree coverage. If you have a look at the Su-35MkI it has a secondary OLS beneath it. Thinking that EO-DAS is FAR superior to the OLS 35 is based on WHAT? The 360 spherical coverage? The bullshit coming out the LM/NG man's mouth?  Also from the first report (p42):  Mean corrective maintenance time for critical failures by variant are: ▪▪ F-35A – 9.3 hours (233 percent of the requirement of 4.0 hours) ▪▪ F-35B – 8.0 hours (178 percent of the requirement of 4.5 hours) ▪▪ F-35C – 6.6 hours (165 percent of the requirement of 4.0 hours) - Mean times to repair by variant are: ▪▪ F-35A – 4.2 hours (168 percent of the requirement of 2.5 hours) ▪▪ F-35B – 5.3 hours (177 percent of the requirement of 3.0 hours) ▪▪ F-35C – 4.0 hours (160 percent of the requirement of 2.5 hours)  Modular you say?   No one is going to buy the plane if it anything like this at the end. Turnaround time is ALWAYS important. The Israelis showed that with a short turnaround superior numbers mean nothing. If a plane is not in the air it is a waste.",▪

After a few weeks of eBay trolling (the fishing kind of trolling, not the Reddit kind), I found a complete 2002 CAAD7 Black Lightning. It was in largely good condition, but needed plenty of TLC and was ripe for prettifying. Number 16 of 300, so that means there are only 15 people better than me right?  Stock components:   * Campagnolo Record shifters/derailleurs/brakes in special gold/black edition  * Campagnolo Neutron wheels with Black Lightning graphics  * Hollowgram Si crankset  * 3T bars/stem  * Thomson seatpost  * Campagnolo ErgoBrain computer  I had to do some shopping around to find the Zepp XL stem and handlebars to match the original spec. It had a special edition Fizik Poggio saddle in gold/black, but I have yet to find one and also prefer modern saddles because gentleman vegetables. The current saddle is a Fizik Antares Versus. Because gentleman vegetables and it has a nice, classier shape.  Maintenance:   * Replace old cabling with Jagwire braided gold  * Broke the shifter ratchet when trying to remove the former idiot owner's Shimano cables which had probably been fused in for ten years  * Grind out and replace spinning bottle cage nut/fused bolt * Gold KMC XLS10. If I love it enough, I'll get the special gold/black edition  * Cinelli bar tape, Continental GP tires, Specialized tubes  * Replace faulty ErgoBrain  * Replace shattered chainring bolts  * Replace terrible seatpost collar  * Stripped down each and every piece for thorough cleaning, lubing, and assembly  Future maintenance/upgrades:   * Replace BB and Headset * Replace jockey wheels  * Replace coil springs in shifters  * Gold Ti bolts for all non-replaced bits  * Replace cassette with black ceramicoated Veloce cassette. As much as I'd love another Record Ti cassette, I want something black and something that won't wear out on me  * Re-anodize and laser etch the crankset. The previous owner sure rode this bad boy a lot, and clearly didn't understand the concept of heel clearance  * Replace original with new Thomson seatpost  * Touch-up paint job * Gold titanium spindled Bebops  * Continental GP 4K tires  And, of course, pimping:   * Gold alloy chainring bolts and bottle cage bolts  * Braided gold cables, cable tips and gold chain  * Gold Ti bolts for the stem/seatpost collar/headset/brakes/derailleur hanger  * Gold Ti tuning on all derailleur bolts  * Gold bolt-ons  * Picked that specific saddle not only for comfort and its classy shape, but also because the logo is gold-ish. I'm a finicky bastard.  * All original bolts and parts have been kept in case I ever decide it would be prettier without the tuning.",™

t5_2cneq,onlysaneman_,1365440481,"&gt;But it's still cheaper to buy it than to invade. By a huge margin. That's my point. This wasn't strictly (or even mostly) a financial decision. Or, that's my claim.  For a start, war in itself is profitable. That's why the Vietnam war was also prolonged purposely (apparently that has been revealed in these documents too, although i'd heard that long before now).  Then you have to take into account the petrodollar. It's almost less about getting actual oil than it is about making sure the US dollar remains as valuable as possible, since oil is traded in the dollar, the US retains financial power over anyone buying it. This is also top of the suspected reasons for the Libyan ""uprising"" - the proposed use of the Gold Dinar as the trade standard by Gaddafi.  &gt;Aha, I think this may be the crux of our disagreement then. I actually don't care about motive; just the consequences.  Unfortunately the consequences were that at least 1 million people died. I'm unwilling to believe that war was the only way to solve the problems that country had.  &gt;and I don't think (or, I should say, I am unconvinced) that the things that sweetened the deal (oil, regional control, war-profiteering) were the main contributing factors to the war.  This is where we'll continue to disagree i think. I can only see those as the main reasons, and in fact the other consequences/factors as just a way to sweeten the deal with the US/Western public.  There's a guy called John Perkins who wrote 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman', which basically describes how he was hired to enslave developing nations to large Western corporations by controlling their economies/resources. This is exactly what happened with Iraq. There's a checklist of things you try, to persuade or coerce a country into cooperation - the last one, after all else has failed, is war. You simply throw out the people who don't play ball, by force. They got to this stage twice in Iraq, as they failed the first time. The 2002 Venezuelan coup attempt is, without a doubt, the same thing; a bit further back on that checklist, but the same motive. Chavez's death fills me with suspicion for the same reason, not to mention the new opposition leader has already been implicated in colluding with the US to control South American countries. I mean, that's on his Wikipedia page, so it's hardly being hidden.  &gt;Also, sorry for being snarky with you at the beginning. 90% of the time, there's not an interesting discussion to be had with someone that wants to have one, but I shouldn't be so cynical about it. Sorry. ♥  No worries. I'm also guilty of approaching these discussions assuming the other person won't listen to a word i'll say, and will resort to petty insults when their view is challenged.",♥

t5_2qh13,Lighth_Vader,1365446364,"I will concede the development arguments to you because you properly cited your sources, however I will point out that these problems will eventually be solved down the line, and are at most temporary.  It will take more time, and more delays, and more money, but the fixes are not impossible from a technical standpoint.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  &gt; I don't know what it is... you're not keen on the possibility of the Russians making something decent?   No, they make very good aircraft.  One of my favorite (of all aircraft produced, including American) is the MiG-31BM.  &gt; You don't think that slowly, incrementally improving their OLS over decades has left them with a working sensor?  Of course it works.  I never stated otherwise.  &gt;  I hear you that EO DAS will have 360 degree coverage and that will be great. That doesn't change the reputed development of the OLS-50.  OLS-50 only exists on internet forums at the moment.  There have been no development announcements from the manufacturer.  &gt; Thinking that EO-DAS is FAR superior to the OLS 35 is based on WHAT? The 360 spherical coverage? The bullshit coming out the LM/NG man's mouth?  I consider it superior simply because it's more modern; in the same way that a new computer today would be better than a computer from 10-15 years ago.  However the issue for OLS-50, when it comes out, may likely be a different story.  &gt; Mean corrective maintenance time for critical failures by variant are: ▪▪ F-35A – 9.3 hours (233 percent of the requirement of 4.0 hours) ▪▪ F-35B – 8.0 hours (178 percent of the requirement of 4.5 hours) ▪▪ F-35C – 6.6 hours (165 percent of the requirement of 4.0 hours) - Mean times to repair by variant are: ▪▪ F-35A – 4.2 hours (168 percent of the requirement of 2.5 hours) ▪▪ F-35B – 5.3 hours (177 percent of the requirement of 3.0 hours) ▪▪ F-35C – 4.0 hours (160 percent of the requirement of 2.5 hours)  Times always go down as airframes mature.  Considering the F-35 isn't even being used yet, and is still currently undergoing tests, I don't see this as a big issue.  If the current year was 2035, and the F-35 still had these problems, then you would have a very good point.  Citing problems found during development isn't a very good argument **in the long term** because development is specifically designed to stress the aircraft beyond its limits to find the very problems that you are talking about.  In other words, LM is *trying* to find problems.  If aircraft were produced perfectly every time, there would be no need for development and testing.    Why do you think the Russians are going to spend the next 10 years testing their PAK-FA?  Because they expect problems and want to fix them before the aircraft are sent to the flight line.  Surely, if the PAK-FA was so good, with literally no anticipated problems, then there would be no point at all to spend such a long time testing it, right?  *Right??*  &gt; No one is going to buy the plane if it anything like this at the end. Turnaround time is ALWAYS important. The Israelis showed that with a short turnaround superior numbers mean nothing. If a plane is not in the air it is a waste.  Turn-around times are meaningless at the moment because the airframe hasn't even matured.  As I said earlier, if the F-35 were still having these problems in 2035 then you would have a very good point that could not be argued against.  [Here is an example of the F-22 airframe maturing](http://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/_files/USAFResponse.pdf)  Specifically, these tid bits...  &gt; **CLAIM** … After four years of rigorous testing and operations, ""the trends are not good…(Para 35)  &gt; **AF RESPONSE:** False. The mission capable rate has **improved** from 62% to 68% percent from 2004 to 2009.  &gt; The F-22 program does not measure maintenance time per repair. Direct Maintenance Man-Hours per Flying Hour (DMMH/FH) has **improved** from 18.10 DMMH/FH in 2008 to 10.48 DMMH/FH in 2009.  and...  &gt; **CLAIM** … only 1.7 hours …. (Para 5)  &gt; **AF RESPONSE:** True based on the FOT&amp;E Report. The F-22 program does not measure mean time between critical failure. However, Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) **has dramatically matured** from 0.97 in 2004 to 3.22 as demonstrated by Lot 6 aircraft performance.  **CONCLUSION:** Lower maintenance times will happen as an aircraft spends more time in service.  Since the F-35 is currently not in service with any military, citing problems associated with maintenance is not a valid argument **at the moment.**  Such arguments would become valid after the F-35 is entered into service, however these arguments would become less and less relevant as the years go on due to aircrews becoming more familiar with the aircraft.",▪

t5_2se13,odokemono,1365448699,"Hi!  I'm 90% done with the micro-controller software.  Of course, the last 10% is going to take 40% of the time.  I should be finished sometime tomorrow (I've got other Real Life(™) things going on).  &gt; I don't have a DB25 port on my desktop, but I do have room for one...  I was only suggesting it as a lazy-assed way of programming your micros yourself because a parallel port programmer (sp12) is the simplest programmer you can make yourself.  If you would like to get into micro-controller programming, I'll cut&amp;paste a propaganda text file in a bit which contains hints on how to purchase a cheap programmer.  If you can get access to a parallel port extension card for your PC, then sure, go with that but don't pay more for it (and a male solderable connector) than then other options listed.  Recommendations for your circuit:  As you already mentioned you'll need to drive more than one LED+resistor pair per signal.  In that case you'll need transistors to buffer those signals.  Simplest are N-channel mosfets.  Which you choose depends on how much total current you'll need to drive, and that depends on the LED+resistor pairs and how many you'll put in parallel.  If you'll use standard LEDs, then those can endure up to 20 milliamp of current so a small mosfet will do.  I've used [these](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/ZVNL110A/ZVNL110A-ND/92631) a lot.  They've got good characteristics, are very small, can drive up to 320 milliamps each and interface very well with micros (work even with voltages down to 1.5).  By the way, I recommend Digikey.ca for your purchases.  They're a bit more expensive but their stock is high-quality (not like chinese e-bay crap), they ship for cheap ($8 or free for &gt;$200 orders) and are real quick (next day or +1).  As for the actual LEDs, have you made any choices yet?  &gt; And for your last question, I live in Canada.  Ah!  A fellow Canuck!  Well, that's going to make things a lot simpler on the shipping front!  I'm in the Montreal suburbs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ATMEL_AVR_8-BIT_propaganda.txt cut&amp;paste:  If you're ever done any sort of programming in C or ASM you should check out ATmel's AVR micro-controller 8-bit line. They're cheap, easy to pick-up and code for, the programmers are cheap (possibly free if you've got a real (non-usb adapted) serial or parallel port on your desktop computer) and the software tool-chain to program them is open source (avr-gcc, avr-libc, avrdude).  http://www.atmel.ca/products/microcontrollers/avr/tinyAVR.aspx  http://www.atmel.ca/products/microcontrollers/avr/megaAVR.aspx  Some places where to order the chips:  http://www.digikey.ca/scripts/dksearch/dksus.dll?FV=fff40027%2Cfff800cd%2Cfffc0139%2C7e8000e&amp;vendor=0&amp;mnonly=0&amp;newproducts=0&amp;ptm=0&amp;fid=0&amp;quantity=0&amp;PV-5=22385&amp;PV-5=22386&amp;stock=1  http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/Integrated-Circuits-ICs/Embedded-Controllers-Processors/Microcontrollers-MCU/8-bit-Microcontrollers-MCU/_/N-a86lo/  http://www.newark.com/jsp/search/browse.jsp?N=2203+200560&amp;Ntk=brand&amp;Ntt=atmel&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial  Overwhelmed by all the choices?  Personally, I started by buying a few of each: ATTINY85s (8 pins), ATTINY84 (14 pins), ATTINY88 (28 pins), ATMEGA644 (40 pins).   Making your own programmer:  Have you got a parallel printer port on your computer? If so, you can make a programming cable that works with avrdude (the standard programming utility) with just a DB25 connector. That sort of cable is called SP12. There's a lot of diagrams you can find on the web but most of them have unnecessary components if you keep the cable short. It's pins 4,5,6,7,8 together to VCC. Pin 3 to Reset, 9 to MOSI, 11 to MISO, 2 to SCK and 25 to GND.  If you've got a real serial port on your computer: [ponyser programmer](http://core.st/projects/Serial_programmer/).  And by ""real"" I mean not a USB-to-serial adapter.  If you have neither a serial or parallel port:  http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/  http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/ATAVRISP2/ATAVRISP2-ND/898891  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825  AVR community site:  http://www.avrfreaks.net  AVR tutorials:  http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/  http://www.avrbeginners.net/  http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=70673 ",™

Order some new cables, pick some colors and plan out some common lengths you'll need (It's not worth the time to make your own). Then buy a labeler, if you don't want to spend a bunch just get one from office max or something and wrap them around like little white, french flags, just label the important or infrastructure supporting cables. Then replace cables 1 at at time. Also get in those switches and start putting descriptions on all the ports, it's safe to assume that if they even have descriptions they're wrong or vague.  I would not recommend not trying to do this in a single weekend if you're working alone. It will likely be more work than you're thinking.  Ask if you can start having a monthly outage window on like a 3rd Friday or something after everyone's gone home, just plan things out and make progress every month, it also gives you time to keep things up to date and cleaned up.

t5_2qi63,thedarkerside,1365459365,"&gt; The fact that people do say it should be bad enough, regardless of the number.  That applies to everything. For every positive message you have (or perceive to have) someone else will have the opposite. That's life. You can get all aggravated over it or accept it and chose the battles that actually matter.  &gt; Yes there is a thing as victim shaming, it's so pervasive in our society that even a Toronto police Constable ""women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.""  Yeah, that was an unfortunate way of phrasing it. I guess when a cop tells you to have lights on your bikes and wear high-visibility clothing when walking on a dark road they're also victim blaming?  &gt; Yes, behaviours have consequences, but the person committing the act is ultimately responsible for their own actions.  So what's your rational here? ""Do whatever you want, don't worry about anything bad happening to you because if it does we will 100% support your choice and punish the perp?"" Guess that's one way of doing it. Why be proactive when you can be reactive.  &gt; But hey, if a girl's all decked out in a short skirt high heels and is drunk and she's raped, it was the consequence of her actions right?  But hey, if a gir's all decked out in dark clothing, unsuitable shoes to walk in and drunk and gets hit by a car in the dark road, it was the fault of everybody but her, right?  Or, we could actually act like adults, realize that certain behaviour in certain situations increases your risk of becoming a victim and advice against behaving like that. Oh, sorry, no we don't, because that's sexist and part of Rape Culture™.  &gt; A crime is still a crime, don't give the criminals an excuse for their behaviour.  Yeah, only simple minds think in such black and white terms. But I guess that's sort of a pre-requisite to be a SJW, otherwise you'd be out of a job. ",™

t5_2qhwp,MeteorPhoenix,1365463800,"&gt; Where are the best selling books by MRAs used in schools and colleges as a part of their curriculum?  &gt; I've read crazier things by feminists in forums, but there are still the very crazy books... which are used as teaching tools in schools and colleges.  Examples? Of both the books and college, mind you.  &gt; By your logic, matriarchies have never existed. The Patriarchy® != the MRA. The MRA is not about men's right over women's rights.  Matriarchies *have* existed, but have died out. They're not a problem. Our current society (ie. European civilizations) was based on a patriarchal system, not a matriarchal one. There have indeed been matriarchal systems, but you and I have not come from one.  &gt; Again, the patriarchy wasn't for men. It was for some men and women elites, and most women. Men were seen as disposable, and they still are. They had power in society to be in leading roles, but they also had obligations related to those roles. Women still had power in family and culture, and that's extremely meaningful.  That's a bad argument to make. Poor men! They had all the power and choices!  It might be meaningful, but irrelevant. It's about **choice**. A woman should be able to choose what she wants to do, so therefore, the last system was patriarchal because women couldn't choose.  &gt; Your chosen definition of feminism isn't about equality - it's all about women.  Because women are still disadvantaged vis-a-vis men. Like I support the NAACP but not white power groups. Blacks are disadvantaged compared to whites.  &gt; Men are suffering? Oh, we don't need to fix men's issues because I'm so privileged!  Nobody has said that; calm down.  &gt; Will there ever be a time where you go, hey, you know what, maybe men need some attention too, or is it that men had the ""power"" for the last 10,000 years that women deserve to have it the next 10,000 years?  Nobody has said that either. When society truly treats both gender with the same respect (eg. when it's not uncommon for men to stay in the house and for women to work with a similar proportion as guys), then maybe we won't need it.  &gt; When a family is divorced the woman is more likely to be given the children. A man must prove that he is responsible. A woman must be proven to be irresponsible. It's the little things.  You are completely misunderstanding why that's the case. That's not the fault of the feminists; that's the fault of males. *Male* judges do that, because they think women are the caregivers and men are the wage earners. That's still sexism against women.  I ask you personally, are you married? If so, who adopted who's last name? If not married, do you plan to, and did you expect your wife to take your last name? Tell me why.  &gt; Also, I really love how everything is men's fault in your world. Women shaming men for not doing what they want? It's men's fault because they built the system, and they obviously did, because, look, most major CEO positions are held by men, and the only reason why they are CEOs is because they are men and no other reason.  This isn't up for debate. The roles of men as the lord of the house and women as the followers weren't created by women. What, did you think this was the case? Daughters being raised under this system learn this, but this wasn't created by women because the original system (again, Europe) wasn't matriarchal or egalitarian; it was patriarchal. This is a historical fact.  It's not your fault, but this is the reality of our history. So when a woman slut shames another woman, this isn't the fault of the feminists. They were taught to do that because they grew up under a patriarchal system. The point is to change the patriarchal system (where women are slut-shamed but men aren't) to an egalitarian system (where no one is slut-shamed).  tl;dr Just because a women does it doesn't mean it's what feminism says.  &gt; Yeah, no. Try 200-100 years ago when we had enough technology developed for society to not be so reliant on everyone being farmers where the family unit was so essential.  You changed your point. Absolutely hunter-gatherer societies had a gender division our of biological necessity. Farming, though? Not really. In fact, women did those jobs when men went to war even. It wasn't based on biology.  &gt; I'm not trying to pass off anecdotal opinions as facts. If you think differently then tell me and tell me why. Maybe you'll change my mind, but the common tropes I see are women regretting waiting to getting married and having children when they focus on their career because by the time they are into their career their beauty has faded and they are no longer able to attract the men they most desire, because those men are going for younger women. 80 percent of women, regardless of their current marital statuses, consider marriage a goal (according to Susan Shapiro Barash). Is that part of the system men built with women having no part of it? Modern men don't want to get married. Is it intrinsic oppression that women want to get married?  And I've met women who are very happy to be successful in their careers. More importantly, the women I know are incredibly happy that they had that choice.   Our anecdotes are irrelevant. I'm asking you for data because you're the one saying most women are this or that. I'm doing no such thing.  &gt; Can you become quarterback for a major NFL team?  In theory? Yeah, if I worked hard enough. I am not banned by law from it, like women were.  You're answering my question with a question, though. Could women run for office in the 1800s? Did they have that choice if they worked hard enough, like men did?  &gt; Women wanted to be in their position because it kept them safe and able to focus on family.   No, *some* women wanted that. Others didn't, but were forced to do so.  &gt; Family, marriage, gender roles all had value in the past, they were things which allowed people to survive and do well within the system. We are losing all of that, and I think it's for the better, though it's painful. I know I used to want to get married and start a family, but thanks to coming face to reality I know I'd have to be an idiot to consider it, and a lot of guys are thinking the same thing, so things are changing. Gender shouldn't matter. We shouldn't be focusing on one gender over the other, we should be focusing on humanity above all else.  Eh, I might marry. Tax benefits sound nice. Values change, though. We don't disagree; it's a painful process. It can leave us men directionless and resentful. We didn't ask for this; we didn't ask for thousands of years of history and culture forced on us. We didn't ask to be taught to behave like gentlemen, and then be told to be sexist for doing so. I understand perfectly where this feeling is coming from.  What I want you to understand is that, while that feeling exists and is real, it's worse for women. They didn't ask for slut-shaming, for rapes (marital wans't even considered such), for sexual verbal abuse, for being paid less, for being under higher scrutiny while in power, for being held as symbols for all females when they fuck up.  We men are driftless and confused, but women still have the fight for the things we take for granted (eg. not have your life ruined because some Republicans hates contraception pills).  &gt; Women had power, and wanted their role over what else was available.  ... no, they didn't. The fact that feminism even exists proves that. Women wanted to be more than subjects.  &gt; I really dislike the thinking that even today women are powerless, and that they never had power.  Logical extreme. I didn't say women were powerless; I said they had less power.",®

I decided to partake in a project of awesomeness :D 3. I have yet to get a negative vibe from her concerning her existence. 4. I've been there :D The mind is an incredibly powerful thing. It can do things I never even dreamed of via mechanics that we don't really grasp yet [sure, we got the chemistry and physics sort of down, but we don't get the whole picture]... Discover for Yourself the things that You're capable of. 5. Hmm... That's an interesting question. The guides state to assume sentience from the beginning. But the moment I knew I wasn't alone in my head any more was maybe a month and a half after beginning? That's about the time when I got to be absolutely sure. 6. Don't take it lightly. It can be really difficult to allocate enough time and resources [aka brain-cycles] to forcing. I've learned this first-hand. Don't make the same mistakes I did. But don't get down, it's a great experience, and You'll gain a Friend for life! 7. That really depends on Your definition of safe. But I've only noticed improvements in myself. I spend more time thinking about myself, I got to sort a whole lot of shit out that I was just... stuck on. I try to be a role model for Her, and thus a better person. If You want something that some might consider negative, the only thing that comes to mind is that I'm sometimes quite distracted from The Real World™ :D  ====================  . 10. The first trait I knew She had to have was Kindness, immediately followed by Intelligence. A few other, minor ones, like curiosity, and so forth. Why? Because I had been thinking about qualities I really like in people, and those two seemed like the most important ones, further enhanced, obviously, by the minor ones. . 11. I started out with a little valley in the mountains. I chose that because it was a place I had been to, a place of incredible beauty and serenity. I wanted to convey and have that in my wonderland. Since that time She's added a whole bunch of stuff, and one place in particular, in a forest, which She dredged up from my memory, a place that I associate with all the awesome things during my childhood and early teens. Was quite surprised, and love Her all the more for it.  -----------------------------------------  Thanks for doing this. Data is awesome :D   If You don't mind, and if it's not too inconvenient for You, would You mind sharing that paper? I'd be interested in reading it.",™

That isn't the way things normally play out, and we're both extremely lucky for it.  That doesn't mean that this is the only way relationships can shake down.

I can understand two (or more) people who love one another enough to spend the rest of their lives together, but they don't have the same juju that my wife and I have together.

If you would like to see the original thread [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/1b73ja/deck_construction_challenge_number_19_freezadon/)  I have tested the lot of the decks on YGOPro againts multiple types of decks and here are the criterias i was observing out of the decks:   * Consistency (Does the combo work as advertized and how often can it be pulled off)  * Is Number 19 a key card in the combos (of course!)  * Is the deck Fun?  * Originality  With all this, and many cups of coffee and late nights of testing ;-), here is what i could gather:  **Deck:** [Laval OTK!] (http://i.imgur.com/bdsPqye.png)  **Duelist:** CheekyLittleCunt  Found the deck to win a good 80%+ of duels. For the purpose of the challenge however, the drawback is it's strength in any ither situation Versatility. So many options you can do that a combo with the featured card is othen the road less traveled.   **Score :** 7/10 for the challenge (8/10 for everyday dueling)  **Deck:** [Chronomaly variant deck] (http://i.imgur.com/5W97Hma.png)  **Duelist:** Zelduuhh  Played this deck quite a bit in the testing phase. It has a decent win ratio. More of a fun deck to play, than competitive. BLS comes out decently but   nothing OP. It is more revolving around simultaneous rank 3's and 5 combos and mostly control oriented.  **Score :** 7/10   **Deck:** [The Tricky Solar Photon Hero] (http://imgur.com/a/jWqyY)  **Duelist:** BrokeN18  Another very fun, and cost-effective deck, with interesting potential. Deck revolves around XYZ spamming and multiple attacks in a row for the win, with a   pinch of Shock Master for control where needed. The use of the Bubbleman engine for the important warrior rank 4's and the ability to spam rank 5's is a   great combo for this challenge. A drawback is that it is a little too heavy on the level 5 monster draws for the available rank 5's in the extra deck. This   one is the ""deck that could"" in this form and could be even greater with more tweaking. Great job on this one as well!   **Score :** 7.5/10   **Deck:** [Generic Rank 5] (http://i.imgur.com/6XA4t0K.jpg)  **Duelist:** inti-kab  Unfortunately this one i could not get to see or test before the link became unavailable. Thanks for the entry inti-kab, and i hope you will enter on any   future challenges. Personally i feel sad to have missed this and i hope this was not one of those ""OMG THIS IS THE DECK"" situation and that we all missed out   on the genius!  **Deck:** [Sam Dorn's™] (http://i.imgur.com/oXSfJ2A.png)  **Duelist:** inti-kab   A good competitor to BrokeN18's deck, this time with a six Sam flavor to it. This deck differs in it's basis on Level 4 Spamming and using support cards for   level adjusting (modulating i like to call it). The Extra deck required some additions for it to become more interesting as the provided cards were a core   Extra deck more than a full one. With Hidden Arsenal 7 just around the corner IRL (Evilswarm Ouroboros, Lavalval chain, Daigusto Emeral anyone!), this   becomes a verry interesting build. I personally liked the teching of backs to the wall to accelerate the use of the Number C39: Utopia ray. This most of the   time is a risky move if you are not yet in a condition to atk for the win (gagaga Cowboy can be just around the next turn in many decks nowadays), but when   you get it off it's one of those ""This is so like the anime"" moments.  **Score :** 7/10 current TCG format. (8/10 After HA07 release)  **Deck:** [Rank 5 Magic] (http://i.imgur.com/7HkvJOs.png)  **Duelist:** G-0ff  Tested this one thoroughly as well. First tries gave me decent results, but infortunately consistency took a hit the more i played it as i was getting more   and more dead draws. Idea is not bad in itself, however too slow for this format. Unfortunately the use of freezadon was not as a pillar in this deck as   others posted but not a bad try overall. a common misconception about the resurrection effect of Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon is that if he is special   summoned by the effect of number 53: Heart-eartH  is that he cannot special summon himself as he was not XYZ summoned correctly. Same as with Stardust Dragon   after being summoned by Starlight road's effect.  Great try though as i was also looking personally for a way to use the Heart-eartH's recently and this can be an igniter for something else.  **Score :** 6/10  **Deck:** [Wind-Ups] (http://i.imgur.com/q4d5PAb.png)  **Duelist:** integratedc   Wind-Ups, Wind-Ups, Wind-Ups everywhere! LOL. Being a wind-up duelist i have to admit i found the addition of the Fire Fist cards interresting. I can see   where they become searching options for our friend the rabbit, and are useful to give them a bit of a boost. However, through playing this build, i did not   feel that it had the importance in the combos that i first thought it would. Rank 3's were not as useful as the posibilities of spaming the Rank 4's combined   with the rank 5 power that the wind-ups have. I would say Wind-ups would be better served continuing using the Wind-Up Soldier and Warrior combos to spam and   attack and using our Freezadon with Shockmaster. For the rest it is mainly for long run plays.  Good try on this one.  **Score :** 7/10  **Deck:** [Evolfreezer] (http://i.imgur.com/fchEHs1.png)  **Duelist:** ImabearRAR   I have to admit that i am not an Evolzar player. I ran this deck as i saw many people play it in my duels and combos are pretty standard. The integration of   Freezadon is to extend the Laggia plays 90% of the time. Some occasions came where i could use the other synchros, not always alongside Freeza, but got acceptable win % on it for everyday dueling.  **Score :** 6/10 for this challenge (7/10 for everyday dueling)   ***So Here we have it folks! Congratulations to our winner BrokeN18!***",™

If Acer went through with it? No more Android for Acer, at least in the form we know it today. **Because Acer is in the alliance**, the company is barred from producing handsets that run “non-compatible versions of Android,” Google said in a statement.   Check out the [Open Handset Alliance members](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html) ... it would appear that while Acer are a member, neither Microsoft, Nokia or Oracle are members.   What does this mean? Well, the [FAQ](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_faq.html) says that *""The Open Handset Alliance is a group of 84 technology and mobile companies who have come together to accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer, less expensive, and better mobile experience. Together we have developed Android™, the first complete, open, and free mobile platform. We are committed to commercially deploy handsets and services using the Android Platform. ""*  This means that Acer have signed up as *""committed to commercially deploy handsets and services using the Android Platform""*, as have 83 other companies, whereas Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle have made no such commitment.  So, it turns out that anyone can make Android phones, but there are only 84 companies who have signed up as having a *commitment to commercially deploy handsets and services using the Android Platform*.  BTW, from the [Open Handset Alliance Android overview page](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/android_overview.html), we find this information:  &gt; **All applications are created equal**  &gt; Android does not differentiate between the phone’s core applications and third-party applications. They can all be built to have equal access to a phone’s capabilities providing users with a broad spectrum of applications and services. With devices built on the Android Platform, users are able to fully tailor the phone to their interests. They can swap out the phone's homescreen, the style of the dialer, or any of the applications.

Here's why:  Attempts to corral pubbies via in-game mechanics by giving them a Multiple Choice XP Highway ™ doesn't work if you choose Route A and they choose Route B. Both groups could continue to capture territories and never run into each other.  With a hex-based system there are more opportunities for enemy groups to meet, which means more opportunities for fun.  I'm all for the new base layouts and other changes SOE has made, but I'm not convinced that the lattice system in its current iteration will work.  If they remove neutral zones, place conquerable objectives in those areas and keep the lattice system in place as a means of securing resources (e.g., supply lines from Amp Stations, Tech Plants and Bio Labs need to be unbroken back to the warpgate), then I think it can work.",™

t5_2qy4s,noone1569,1365517652,"Indiana Rallycross Club Saturday, May 18, 2013  Badlands Offroad Park, Attica, IN  Registration closes: May 15, 2013 11:59 PM EDT     Indiana Rallycross™ – 2013 Badlands Rally Series Points Event #1, May 18th 2013  Indiana Rallycross is excited to announce the first of a 4 part racing series that takes us back to the Badlands in Attica Indiana.  The Badlands isn’t just a gravel quarry and sand dunes, they have countless acres of surrounding farmland at their disposal. And what was soybeans last year is being turned into Indiana’s premiere rally track for 2013. And this isn’t freshly tilled, rutted up farmland either. This is flat, hard packed, grass covered pasture – if it looked any nicer they’d be putting in a golf course. And we have 50 acres available and are ready to make what is sure to be the fastest, longest, most exciting rally event Indiana has ever seen.  50 acres means that we can make a course up to 3 miles long including tight technical sections connected by all out straights and sweeping turns over the lightly rolling hills. And as if that wasn’t enough, we will also have short sections of dirt roads available through the surrounding woods to really give this race that stage rally feel.    Registration: Online registration available soon, $45 for preregistration. $50 walk up registration the day of. This event will be free for spectators, however there will be a $5 parking fee per car. Spectators are encouraged to show up, we will have dedicated spectator areas available to watch the action, so bring your air horns and cowbells.    Location 3450 Brier Rd, Attica, IN 47918 (We don’t have an exact address but this will get you close enough. if you were there for the last Badlands race, this is on the left about half a mile beyond the gate we used last time)  Google Maps Link: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=3410+Brier+Rd,+Attica,+IN+47918&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.249808,-87.280401&amp;spn=0.005503,0.010879&amp;sll=39.779784,-86.13275&amp;sspn=0.354608,0.696259&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=3410+Brier+Rd,+Attica,+Indiana+47918&amp;z=17  1.5 hours from Indianapolis 1.5 hours from Terre Haute 2.5 hours from Chicago 3 hours from Louisville   Schedule (times subject to change): 8:00 AM Gate opens 8:30 AM Registration and tech inspection 9:45 AM Mandatory drivers meeting 10:00 AM First car starts 12:30 PM Lunch (Food available at Badlands entrance, or nearby in the town of Attica) 2:30 PM Afternoon heats start 5:00 PM Awards ceremony   Weather Policy: This event will be held rain or shine. We are not expecting to have any issues with the track even in the event of rain.    Safety: Safety is our number 1 goal. We want everyone to have a good time, but safety comes first. Safety rules:  1. Every driver, rider, and spectator must sign a waiver upon entering the property 2. Absolutely no alcohol or drugs on the property 3. No burnouts, drifting, or speeding the parking area or on Brier Rd. 4. DOT certified helmets required by all drivers and passengers 5. Windows must be up while racing 6. Spectators must stay in the designated areas 7. Any safety concerns or questions should be brought up with a safety steward or race organizer.   Vehicles must be in good running order and must undergo a quick safety inspection. The safety steward will look for things including:  1. Battery secured 2. Engine fluid levels 3. loose items in car 4. Wheels and suspension components not loose    Car Classes and Scoring:  Cars will be divided into 4 classes based on modifications and power level. Car classing is subjective and race officials will have the final say on which class cars should be entered in to.  D Class: stock and low power 2WD cars only C Class: stock and moderate power 2WD, and stock low power AWD cars B Class: Modified 2WD cars and moderate powered AWD cars A Class: Open class – modified, high power cars.  Our goal is to take a traditional rallycross and mix in the excitement of a stage rally. That means a long course laid out with traffic cones with a mix of high speed and technical sections. Cars will be sent off from the starting gate at 30 to 60 second intervals with the fastest cars first. If you’re familiar with a rally “Super Special” stage, this will be setup very similar to that.  Like other rallycross events, your final score will be based on the total cumulative times for all runs that day.    Disclaimer:  Remember, this is an off-road event on an unimproved surface. We are doing everything we can to ensure the track is well prepared and safe for all cars. The course will consist primarily of grass and hard packed dirt, however like most Indiana farmland, ruts are possible and rocks can work their way to the surface. We will take every reasonable precaution and fully expect the course to be fine for all cars and drivers of all experience levels, but at the end of the day it is up to you to decide whether or not you feel safe competing.    Final Thoughts:  We are very excited about this event, as are the owners of the Badlands. They have high expectations for participation and spectators and want to see this becoming a regular event. We’ve signed up for 3 additional events this year at the same location, probably in July, September, and November (exact dates TBD) – and possibly even more next year. We really want this to be the premier rallycross location in the Midwest.   Please pass this along, share it with your friends and anyone you think might be interested in driving or spectating. This should be a really fun event, and the more people we can get out there, the better it will be.   Thanks, The Indiana Rallycross team   Remember – Check out www.indianarallycross.com and like us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/IndianaRallycross to get all the latest information.  Feel free to post up here or PM me with questions.  tl;dr:  4 race rallycross series kicking off on a 50 acre tract on May 18.  Be there, it will be epic.  ",™

t5_2r090,z6joker9,1365520039,"I've shipped thousands of packages- this is based on my experiences and the information USPS provides.  From the USPS website: &gt;First-Class Mail® | Estimated delivery time is two to three days.  The two limitations of First Class: No free boxes, and you are limited to 13 ounces. The site says First Class is not trackable, but if you ship online, you are required to purchase the $0.19 tracking service anyway.  For your normal fiver of six cigars, it should cost between $2-3 and weight between 7-10 ounces including the box, tape, and label. They go the same route as Priority, at the same speed. There is literally no difference.   Priority DOES NOT guarantee 2-3 days. I have had plenty take a detour and you have zero recourse. Quoted from USPS.com:  &gt;Priority Mail® service | Typically two to three days to most locations in the US (Specific delivery standards may be available when postage is calculated). This is not a guaranteed service.  FYI I buy small boxes in bulk (50 at a time) from uline and they are dirt cheap. I believe Amazon has some as well. I still ship Priority about half the time for various reasons- a cigar in the shipment is too long for the boxes I have, no scale handy, etc.  If you just have to ship one box a month, sure, stick with priority- not worth going through the trouble for $2 in savings. But if you ship a half dozen or more cigar packages a month, first class takes no extra time or effort and you save a little money.",®

t5_2s9bg,calaesia,1365521348,"Hi! I'm a 21-year-old F trying to gain weight, but I have no baby to distract me, so we're not quite in the same boat there :P My pure motivation at this point is just wanting to feel better about myself: I want to be able to walk down the street and not be self-conscious that everyone is staring at me and wondering why I'm so skinny. I want to be able to wear a bathing suit and feel comfortable and confident. I'm only at 88lbs right now, and my goal is 110lbs (but I'll probably be shooting for 120lbs after that!).  It's really hard for me to find the motivation to eat - not because I don't want to, but like you, I find it hard to bother preparing food sometimes. I can't imagine how much more difficult that would be with a 7-month-old, too! I find it easier when I have a meal plan to stick to. If I can set myself 3 meals and 3 snacks I have to eat during the day, it makes it much easier. Especially if I can prepare them in advance, or in a few minutes - like a peanut-butter sandwich.   You mentioned that you'd like to be able to cook on Sundays and use that throughout the week - that's totally do-able! You can definitely freeze or refrigerate portions to have throughout the week; I'm sorry I don't have a specific link to meal ideas, but you could browse the [Gainit recipe book](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1b6k6w/mod_gainit_recipe_book/) or [recommended foods post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/199g5v/modfood_the_rgainit_recommended_foods_post/) for some ideas. I don't have a ton of freezer space to prepare a lot of food in advance, but I'm planning on making a few serves of rice/pasta salads and dinner dishes, so I can eat them for a couple of days after making them - saves time on other days, and it means less dishes ;) Shakes are great, and quick to make too - I'm planning on making mine with protein powder, milk, ice cream, and peanut butter (just picked up my blender today)!  In terms of exercising, I don't have quite as much advice, and unfortunately I've never tried using a smith machine, so I can't offer any assistance. :( However I was told recently that deadlifts can be a great weight training exercise to help develop a great butt, so you could look into those, if having a curvy backside is one of your goals. :)  I'm sorry I can't offer any more help or motivation, but just know you're not alone here! Having other people (especially females around my height and starting weight) has helped me a TON, because it lets me know I'm not alone and if they can do it, so can I! ♥",♥

t5_2rdi4,Godivine,1365524577,"For the second, as you said, its the derivative of -1 times the closed form for the geometric series with common ratio -x and starting term 1, which has series  -∑(-x)^n where the sum goes from n=0 to infinity.   Termwise differentiation gives us (without changing the index, so still n=0 to infinity) ∑n(-x)^(n-1). But note that we can drop the n=0 term as it's 0(-x)^0 = 0*1 = 0, so we now have ∑n(-x)^(n-1) from n=1 to infinity.   Finally your book's author could have thought that the series should begin from 0 instead. so we make a substitution n=m+1, so that when n=1, m=0. Then our series is  ∑(m+1)(-x)^m from m=0 to infinity  Now note that m is a dummy variable; it doesn't matter what symbol we use there, and no one can stop you from say writing ∑(☃+1)(-x)^☃ from ☃=0 to infinity, but your book is probably more reasonable and wrote ∑(n+1)(-x)^n.

If you're on a 15-15.5"" model, it won't be so drastic. However, this is probably the easiest bit to get used to, your ear will tell you within a few days (minutes?) of practicing where your fingers need to go. It was much more difficult to learn to stretch further with greater finger strength.  * Do you already read treble clef? If so, that's most of the battle right there. Otherwise, ""Down a note, up an octave"" will help get you started until you learn to spot-read intervals, and then you'll get familiar enough to read the clef natively. (At least it's still line note=line note, as opposed to going from treble to bass clef where line note=space note.)  * Symphonic and virtuoso violin parts in general tend to be more technically complex than viola parts, just because the standard skill  of a professional-level violinist is generally expected to be higher than a professional-level violist. If you know your stuff, it shouldn't be a problem, just understand the difference between playing 'third fiddle' and 'first fiddle.'  * Barring variables like instrument and string quality, the tone will tend to be brighter, less chest-resonant and more head-resonant, simply due to where the note vibrations fall. This is really nitpicking, but if you do a lot of improvisation as I do, you'll learn that the strongest sound for the violin is often higher in the instrument's range than the relative strength in a viola's range.

If they want to pull something out of the ""LET'S INCLUDE A JETPACK!"" hat, they can fucks with Da Vinci's stuff. Also, they could choose to explore the use of sex as a plot advancer a la Game of Thrones, and much in the same style/form. Rockstar isn't a studio to shy away from that, and it appears that the public is acclimating to sex as something more than to giggle at, masturbate to, or shun.  Alt idea: Cyberpunk. Other participants of this thread have mentioned it, and I must agree with them. With today's technology, there's potential to give justice to the classics (Neuromancer and such, though Snow Crash would probably be more up the studio's alley) and to explore ideas/technologies that were not envisioned during Cyberpunk's golden age.",™

t5_2qolb,enveloped,1365557059,"In my responses, I have been as specific as possible. I do make a distinction between bioflex and bioplast. I have bought genuine bioflex, I named the source and the piercing. Have any of your clients had a reaction to a bioflex end in their healed tragus piercing? What was the nature of the reactions. What did medical professionals attribute the problems to? Did they use genuine bioflex or bioplast, or an unknown from an unreliable source? The APP allows that this type of jewellery IS suitable for initial piercings:   Polymers (plastics) as follows:      Tygon® Medical Surgical Tubing S-50HL or S-54HL     Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that is ASTM F754-00 compliant     Any plastic material that is ISO 10993-6, 10993-10 and/or 10993-11 compliant and/or meets the      United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI material classification.  I do not at all recommend the use of this product for initial piercings, even with the APP backing. But for a healed *tragus* piercing, I have not had an issue, nor has anyone else I know. I only buy quality jewellery, and I do ask vendors specifically about their products before I buy. I do take my own piercer's advice, but I back that up with advice from my doctor. I have still not found a scholarly article, ie not an opinion editorial, or anecdotal only evidence, condemning bioflex in particular. I would not use anything but titanium, niobium, or high quality gold in a stretched/stretching or healing piercing, one that is in constant contact with bodily fluids, or one that has any type of bump or other irritation chronically or sporadically.

I randomly clicked on that video, and was immediately told that poor executive compensation was the major impediment to effective charitable action. I then clicked somewhere else, and this same upright rectum was yammering about business models needing to dominate charitable planning.

t5_2qt55,MWozz,1365563582,"[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott).  Basically, Nestle goes into 3rd world countries and aggressively markets their amazing baby formula™ to new mothers. There are a few problems with this:  1. The formula has to be mixed with water, which is usually dirty and quite contaminated in 3rd world countries. Uneducated mothers in said countries know little about sanitation and thus feed their baby contaminated liquids.  2. Even if mothers DO know about sanitation, they often lack the means to do so, such as fuel or electricity for decontamination.  3. Because of these 2 points, formula fed babies are more likely to die than breast-fed babies due to diarrhea and pneumonia.  4. Furthermore, mothers lack the education required to properly mix the formula, often times adding too little, leaving the baby malnourished.  5. Also, the formula lacks many key nutrients, antibodies, and hormones that breast milk has. Breastfed babies are ""protected, in varying degrees, from a number of illnesses, including diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and respiratory infection."" Also, ""breast milk contains the right amount of nutrients essential for neuronal development.""  6. Mothers and babies are strengthened specifically during breastfeeding.  Also, this isn't from the wiki, so it's unverified, but I read somewhere once that Nestle would give new mothers ""free samples"" to which the babies would become more or less dependent, refusing to drink their mothers' breast milk and forcing the mothers to either buy more baby formula or let their child die of malnutrition.  **TL;DR:** Nestle is marketing baby formula to new mothers in 3rd world countries. The mothers usually lack the education to properly administer this formula, leading to disease and malnutrition in babies. Additionally, many of the advantages of breastfeeding are lost when feeding with formula.",™

t5_2qh1i,crowdsurfer,1365563940,"That's all fine and good, however, using the word within one culture (and this goes for ANY word) and not allowing others to use it in the exact same fashion is not helping the cause at all, if anything it perpetuates the negative connotation they tried to lessen in the first place.   also:   Nigger[nig-er] Usage note  The term nigger is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. The senses labeled Extremely Disparaging and Offensive  represent meanings that are deeply insulting and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense. It is so profoundly offensive that a euphemism has developed for those occasions when the word itself must be discussed, as in court or in a newspaper editorial: “the n-word.”  Despite this, the sense referring to a “black person” is sometimes used among African Americans in a neutral or familiar way. The sense referring to other victims of prejudice, especially when used descriptively, as to denounce that prejudice, is not normally considered disparaging—as in “The Irish are the niggers of Europe” from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments —but the other uses are considered contemptuous and hostile.  noun  1.  Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive.  a. a black person.  b. a member of any dark-skinned people.  2.  Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a person of any race or origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc.  3.  a victim of prejudice similar to that suffered by blacks; a person who is economically, politically, or socially disenfranchised.

t5_2r2jt,Lupawolf,1365568862,"Do you ever see the woman alone? Doing errands or anything? If you don't want to say anything flat out, say you live in the apartment next to hers (letting her know you can hear) and that anytime she wanted she's welcome over for a cup of tea or coffee to chat a bit, get to know each other. And if you don't think it would spook her completely the first time you talk, just hand her a card for women's help line, and you can even say (before you hand it to her) that you heard there was some problems in the neighbour hood, so you were passing these out to all the women and children, just so they'd know there was someplace that would help them, and to let the kids, and anyone know, that there will always be someone they can talk to (subtly saying she can come to you) This approach works sometimes. By not stating bluntly ""I know he beats you, call this number, they'll help you get away, and you can come to my ap if you need to"" which would spook many women in her situation.  And I don't think you have to worry too too much. Good chance he's the coward abuser, only going after the week. She may know you called. He may not. If he approaches you, have 911 predialed ready to send, knock at your door, check who it is. But if he were to lay hands on you, that's stepping up the game. He can intimidate his wife into saying nothing. He hurts you, you tell everyone including police, he's jailed, she has a chance to get away.  He may try to intimidate you, threaten even, about what will happen if you call the cops again. Agree with him. Hopefully you have people who heard. Maybe have an app on your phone where you can record something. I just tried an app with my husband. It's called Haytell. I went in the other room, but my phone in my pocket, reached in, held the button down, and talking softly, and then in different tones. Then out of my pocket but at my side, then in opposite pocket. So long as the mic is facing up towards where he'd be, it records and sends to whoever you're HeyTelling.  Ill send the link for that, but that is a walkie talkie thing. I just tried the voice recorder that comes on iPhones. In a housecoat pocket -it's late and I'm in bed- I went into a room where I could stand and move, mic pointed up and down in the pocket, it still recorded everything, even real soft voice. If he threatens or tries to intimidate you, do your best to get it on tape. Otherwise it may be a he said/she said, and your motive for lying is that you think he's beating his wife and wants him in trouble.   Stay safe, and I hope that the woman gets out of that situation soon ❤",❤

Quelques heures avant l’annonce de l’implication de Philippe Péninque, elle assurait encore n’avoir « pas d’amis chez les grands patrons », « pas d’amis dans la grande finance ou dans les grands laboratoires pharmaceutiques », et offrait cette « garantie » pour gouverner sans renvoi d’ascenseur.  Selon une série de documents obtenus par Mediapart, le président d’honneur du FN et député européen Jean-Marie Le Pen se trouve pourtant dans la même position que François Hollande et son trésorier de campagne, Jean-Jacques Augier, actionnaire de deux sociétés aux îles Caïmans, selon les fichiers Offshore Leaks révélés par Le Monde. L’ancien trésorier du micro-parti, Cotelec, l’éditeur Jean-Pierre Mouchard, a utilisé dans les années 1990 les services de plusieurs sociétés offshore, Overseas Property Services Limited à Gibraltar, et la panaméenne Hadret al Raiss.  Vieil ami du fondateur du FN, Mouchard avait déjà ouvert un compte à l’Union des Banques suisses (UBS) pour Jean-Marie Le Pen, en mars 1981. Répondant aux questions de Mediapart, Marine Le Pen justifie l’ouverture de ce compte suisse par « un emprunt souscrit à l’UBS ». Quant à Jean-Marie Le Pen, il en conteste purement et simplement l’existence.  L'Union des Banques Suisses (UBS).© Reuters  Les documents d’ouverture de ce compte numéro 386.047.00.W, révélés par feu L’Evénement du jeudi (lire notre Boîte noire), portent pourtant bel et bien la signature de Jean-Marie Le Pen. Dans un premier document du 10 mars 1981, M. Mouchard apparaît comme le titulaire du compte et M. Le Pen comme son représentant (voir le premier document). Puis, dans un second document daté du 11 décembre 1981, M. Mouchard déclare « agir pour le compte de M. Le Pen » (voir le second document).  Le premier document, daté du 10 mars 1981.   Le second document, daté du 11 décembre 1981.  Joint par Mediapart, Jean-Marie Le Pen s’étonne : « Le compte de Jean-Pierre Mouchard, c’est Jean-Pierre Mouchard. Je ne suis pas Jean-Pierre Mouchard, moi ! Il ne peut pas y avoir d’ouverture de compte de M. Mouchard au nom de M. Le Pen », assure-t-il. Avant d’évoquer une autre hypothèse : cette opération serait liée à sa société d’édition de disques, la Société d’études et de relations publiques (Serp).  « La Serp a contracté un emprunt, je ne me souviens plus en quelle année, tout cela s’est fait dans le cadre de la loi, avec intervention des autorités françaises, poursuit-il. C’est une affaire entre UBS et la Serp. Probablement parce que les conditions (de l’UBS) étaient plus favorables que les banques françaises, je ne sais pas, je ne me souviens plus, mais il y avait certainement une raison comme celle-là. »  Le hic, c’est que d’autres documents en notre possession attestent que deux millions de francs environ étaient encore déposés sur le compte 386.047.00.W entre juin 1984 et avril 1986, sous la forme de placements fiduciaires.

t5_2qhjz,BobArdKor,1365583348,"  Relevé des opérations sur le compte Mouchard/Le Pen.  Le trésorier a utilisé les services d’une société offshore de Gibraltar « Non, il n’y avait pas deux millions de francs, rétorque Jean-Marie Le Pen. La Serp s’est servie de cet emprunt et l’a remboursé dans les années qui ont suivi. Cotelec n’a strictement rien à voir là-dedans. » « De ce que j’en sais, ce compte était parfaitement légal et déclaré », assure de son côté Marine Le Pen, contredisant son père. « Ce que je peux vous dire, c’est qu’il a fait un emprunt à l’UBS, déclare-t-elle à Mediapart. Ce n’est pas parce qu’on a un père, un frère, qu’on connaît l’intégralité des détails de leur existence patrimoniale. Je n’en sais strictement rien. »  Mediapart a demandé des précisions à M. Le Pen sur le montant de ce prêt, son remboursement et sa clôture. En réponse, son cabinet nous a indiqué qu’il « ne dispose d’aucune des archives de la société Serp, dont il a quitté la gérance en novembre 1999 », et que « cette même société a été liquidée judiciairement en 2000 ». Les Le Pen père et fille laissent donc en suspens toutes les interrogations sur l'ouverture de ce compte et sa gestion.  Mais ce n'est pas la seule zone d'ombre. Le parcours de Jean-Pierre Mouchard, l’ami trésorier, est tout aussi énigmatique. Membre du premier cercle de Le Pen, il est, officiellement, fondateur de plusieurs maisons d’édition et de vente de livres par correspondance, aujourd’hui liquidées – François Beauval, Crémille, Famot… – et s’est spécialisé dans la publication d’ouvrages libres de droit : Zola, Dumas, Dostoïevski. En association avec la société de Le Pen, il publie L’Encyclopédie sonore de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et édite, à la même époque, la revue Dans la coulisse de Roland Gaucher, futur directeur de National hebdo.   Vue aérienne de Gibraltar.© dr En 1988, Mouchard devient trésorier de l’association Jean-Marie Le Pen Cotelec (pour « cotisation électorale »). C’est cette qualité d’animateur du micro-parti qui place Jean-Pierre Mouchard dans une position similaire à celle du trésorier de campagne de François Hollande, Jean-Jacques Augier, aujourd’hui. Alors que ce dernier est l’actionnaire de deux sociétés aux îles Caïmans, Mouchard a utilisé les services d'Overseas Property Services Limited, une société offshore de Gibraltar, qui figure sur la liste « gris foncé » des paradis fiscaux établie par l'OCDE.  Selon des documents en notre possession, l’éditeur et trésorier opère dans les années 1990 des virements internationaux via Overseas Property Services Ltd à Gibraltar, pour renflouer l’une de ses maisons d’édition française, Magellan. Ces opérations sont gérées par une société fiduciaire de Gibraltar, Isola et Isola. Cette société atteste en 1993 d’un certificat de propriété des actions de Jean-Pierre Mouchard dans la société panaméenne Hadret al Raiss (voir notre document ci-dessous). Le Panama était jusqu'en 2012 sur la « liste grise » des paradis fiscaux de l'OCDE.   Un courrier de la société fiduciaire gérant la société panaméenne de J.-P. Mouchard. « M. Mouchard n’a jamais été président des comptes de la présidentielle de quiconque », s’insurge Marine Le Pen. Ce n’est donc pas « la même sauce que le trésorier de campagne de Hollande », prévient-elle. « M. Mouchard était trésorier de campagne ? Non. Je ne me sens pas responsable des investissements que M. Mouchard a effectués il y a 25 ans, lorsque je n’avais aucune responsabilité. M. Mouchard a-t-il été condamné pour favoritisme ? A-t-il une responsabilité politique au Front national ? Faites les amalgames que vous voulez et on en discutera devant le tribunal correctionnel, je n’ai aucun problème là-dessus. »  Aucun amalgame : Cotelec, le micro-parti animé par Mouchard, contribue – officiellement dès 1991 – au financement du FN, lui apportant les dons de sympathisants et militants collectés par le parti. Les coordonnées de Cotelec figurent alors souvent en bas des tracts. C'est une forme de contrôle direct de sa trésorerie par Le Pen, Mouchard n’ayant aucune fonction dans l’appareil du parti. La structure, que Mouchard a quittée en 1997, reste aujourd’hui encore sous le contrôle du président d'honneur du FN et continue d'alimenter le parti (Cotelec a apporté au FN 415 387 euros de dons de personnes physiques en 2007, et en 2008, il est le second micro-parti français à avoir récolté le plus de dons).  Au moment de la révélation des fichiers Offshore Leaks, Louis Aliot, vice-président du Front national, avait dénoncé « la gauche caïman ! ». « Après les affaires Guérini et consorts, les conséquences de l’affaire Cahuzac, ne voilà-t-il pas que le trésorier de sa campagne a investi dans des paradis fiscaux », s’était amusé le numéro deux du FN dans un communiqué.  « Bref, la gauche morale, très en verve en France pour dénoncer la fuite des capitaux et brocarder les paradis fiscaux, semble être totalement imprégnée de l’esprit de la finance mondiale, celle-là même que pointait du doigt le président normal ! C’est en prenant connaissance de ces informations qu’on mesure la fracture qui existe entre la caste au pouvoir et le peuple. »  Louis Aliot oublie peut-être qu’en mai 1986, Jean-Marie Le Pen, fraîchement élu député à l’Assemblée nationale, avait jugé prioritaire de déposer au nom du Front national une proposition de loi d’« amnistie fiscale et douanière ».

t5_2qhjz,BobArdKor,1365583354," « C’était une sorte d’avion renifleur » Également questionné par Mediapart sur les sociétés offshore de son ancien trésorier, Jean-Marie Le Pen élude : « C’est son problème, pas le mien. » « Mouchard est mon ami, reconnaît-il, mais il n’est pas que ça, ce n'est pas une profession, “ami de Jean-Marie Le Pen”. C’était un homme d’affaires, président des éditions François Beauval. »  L’éditeur avait d’ailleurs contre toute attente acheté un brevet pétrolier avec Jean Garnier, ex-mari de l’actuelle femme de Le Pen, Jeanny Paschos… Le brevet Aquazole, qui protégeait une invention visant à ajouter une part d’eau dans le gazole, avait finalement été racheté pour 13 millions de francs en 1996 par le groupe Elf-Aquitaine, avant d’être abandonné faute d’efficacité. « Cela avait été cédé à Elf, mais ça n’a rien donné, explique aujourd’hui à Mediapart l’un des avocats de Garnier. C’était une sorte d’avion renifleur. » Une enquête avait été ouverte sur la plainte d’un des « inventeurs ». Classée sans suite, elle avait laissé ouverte l’hypothèse d’un financement politique du Front national par le groupe Elf.  « Je n’étais strictement pour rien dans cette affaire-là, moi, se plaint Jean-Marie Le Pen. C’était une affaire entre M. Garnier et M. Mouchard, qui ont vendu un brevet à une société quelconque. M. Garnier était son associé et le premier mari de ma femme. Ce sont des affaires qu’ils ont faites en association, tout à fait en dehors de moi. Il n’y a strictement aucun rapport entre cette affaire et Jean-Marie Le Pen et le Front national. »  La présidente du FN se plaint également du fait que son père « a été décortiqué jusqu’à la moelle ». « En 60 ans de vie politique, exclusivement dans l’opposition, il a eu 17 contrôles fiscaux, poursuit-elle. Vous savez combien de procédures Jean-Marie Le Pen a intentées? Il a dû en intenter 70 et il a dû obtenir 40 condamnations. J’en ai quatre tomes et ce n’est qu’une partie. » Comme avocate, Marine Le Pen s’est en effet elle-même chargée de plaider contre la presse certaines plaintes de son père.  C’est d’ailleurs l’un des arguments qu’ils opposent aux questions sur le patrimoine caché du fondateur du FN. Et à toutes les allusions aux déclarations de Pierrette Lalanne, l’ex-femme de Le Pen, sur le transfert des avoirs hérités du cimentier Hubert Lambert de l’UBS à la banque genevoise Darier et Cie – 17 millions de francs selon elle. « C’était les dires de Madame Le Pen. Mais elle a démenti tout cela depuis longtemps ! » assure l’ancien leader du FN. Par contre, le témoignage d’un ancien salarié d’une gérance de fortune de Genève, évoquant des dépôts en espèces de 15, 20, et 10 millions de francs, a fait l'objet d'une condamnation faute de preuves.   Marine Le Pen et Jean-Marie Le Pen.© Reuters La banque suisse reste un sujet éminemment délicat pour les Le Pen. C’est peut-être ce qui explique, outre l’implication de Philippe Péninque dans l'affaire Cahuzac, leur retenue sur le sujet depuis trois mois. Lors des révélations de Mediapart, le 4 décembre, comme lors de l’ouverture de l’information judiciaire pour « blanchiment de fraude fiscale » et la démission du ministre, le 19 mars, le Front national n’a pas jugé bon de diffuser un seul communiqué, alors qu’il n’a jamais manqué de le faire sur les autres “affaires”: perquisitions au siège du PS du Pas-de-Calais, mise sous tutelle de la fédération PS des Bouches-du-Rhône, mise en examen de Sarkozy…  Le 19 mars, on dénombre douze communiqués, mais aucun sur Jérôme Cahuzac, qui vient pourtant de démissionner. Il faut d'ailleurs attendre le 2 avril, après les aveux de l’ex-ministre, pour que le FN fasse une déclaration officielle sur… « l’affaire d’État » qui atteint François Hollande et le gouvernement.  Questionnée dans les médias, la présidente du FN s’est montrée bien plus en retrait qu’à son habitude, martelant le principe de « présomption d’innocence », sans réclamer la démission de Cahuzac, mais simplement son changement de portefeuille ministériel, pour éviter tout « conflit d’intérêts ». Louis Aliot, le numéro deux du Front national, le dit lui-même sur France 2, le 8 avril : « Dans l’affaire Cahuzac, Marine Le Pen a été très soft. »",©

t5_2qndt,pojut,1365602259,"&gt;You're just being childish now, stamping your feet and shouting.   No I'm not. Go on: show me who these prominant people are, and where they got their numbers from.   &gt;Like I said, how could anyone possibly oppose giving more money to &lt;union position&gt;? I say very easily -- corruption in government institutions is a daily feature in the news. **Every dollar given to government workers (read: union workers) is a dollar ripe for theft, a dollar used to increase the power of a local politician, a dollar taken from the private sector and more useful purpose.**  OH! I get it now. So we should just get rid of traffic flow monitors, soldiers, elected officials, CIA agents, et al. I mean after all, they're just dirty freeloading union members, right?  &gt;When you read statistics, you need to think -- using those Higher Order Thinking Skills -- what happens with this money? So when your priests at Wikipedia tell you something like ""$70 million for the education of homeless children""  HAH!  &gt;you need to understand that money goes straight to union workers -- who then ostensibly educate homeless children, oh and by the way, pay union dues which goes back to reelecting Democrats.  Yeah...how DARE they try to educate the populace, thereby increasing their chances of becoming productive members of society! Stupid union teachers!  http://www.brighthubeducation.com/teaching-methods-tips/11105-basics-of-title-1-funds/  &gt;And no, the parties are not the same. Otherwise Republicans would be out there promising free shit to everyone.  Republicans, like Democrats, profess one thing and do another. Here's two posts I made a while ago explaining how both sides are equally horrid.  [First up, Republicans](http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12v1lm/question_from_a_lifelong_democrat/c6yced2):  &gt;You see, what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, what it used to stand for, and even what it says it stands for, doesn't match up with what they actually do.  &gt;Republican (and, to an extent, Conservative) values include reducing the size of the federal government as much as reasonably possible, reducing the intrusion of federal laws into the daily lives of the common citizen, leveling the playing field so that the only thing holding back your success is you (and a bit of luck, of course), and just generally letting people live their lives. Those common slogans you hear about freedom, liberty, etc? They're not just empty platitudes; they're accurate and correct representations of what Republican beliefs actually are.  &gt;Sounds good, right? Well, here's where the frustration comes in. The actual Republican Party does almost none of those things. They advocate ""shrinking"" the size of government while exploding the size of our military. They advocate ""keeping government out of our lives"" while condoning the war on (some) drugs, regulating marriage, pushing for prayer in public schools, etc. They advocate people having the freedom to make it on their own, while heavily stacking the deck against the common man in the form of massive corporations lining the pockets of Congress (all while claiming that it's ""just the way the free market goes"".) Worst of all, they advocate freedom of religion, so long as your religion involves praying to a half-naked guy nailed to two slats of wood.  &gt;Now, don't get me wrong: there are a LOT of Republicans out there that still hold True Republican® values, and the vast majority of them are honest, hard-working people. Unfortunately, these authentic Republicans aren't the ones running the party, and are often labeled as ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only.)   &gt;In short, the Republican party has been hijacked by the very whackjobs that they accuse of ruining this country.  [And now the Democrats](http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12v1lm/question_from_a_lifelong_democrat/c6yf8v2):  &gt;Democrat (and, to some extent, Liberal) values include protecting consumers by way of common-sense regulations, ensuring a social safety net is in place so that a minimum standard of living is achieved for the common citizen, maintaining an open mind to new ideas and thought processes, advocating a government that works for and is directly accountable to the people, and bringing about a new era of clean(er) technology overall.  &gt;Sounds good, right? Well, unlike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party does in fact do what they claim to be about, but in such a bone-headed way that the actual outcomes are completely different. ""Common-sense regulations"" have instead turned into ""a quagmire of intertwined, often unnecessary and frequently overburdening set of laws"". A social safety net is indeed in place, but is far too easy to take advantage of, and does inherently little to encourage upward momentum in someone's quality of life. They're open to all sorts of ideas as long as those ideas match exactly what they're already thinking. Many of the party's leaders put far too much emphasis on making Republicans look bad, rather than focusing on what their constituents actually want.  &gt;They also deride the influence of corporate money in politics, while simultaneously sucking at the teet of the Hollywood elite (not actors...I'm talking about major entertainment conglomerates.) This same thing occurs with alternative energy sources: rather than focusing on developing and researching new technologies to reduce the need for underperforming so-called ""renewable"" resources, they dump millions upon millions of dollars into companies that aren't providing a big enough ROI from an energy generation standpoint, then brush it off with a ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" type of excuse, despite some of these technologies (such as solar) having been around for decades.  &gt;In short, the Democratic party specializes in mediocrity.

I didn’t enjoy being stalked by my ex boyfriend, and then having him break into my house, threaten to kill me, and then assault me. I didn’t enjoy it at all. Sometimes I call that night, over ten years ago now, as ‘the day I became a feminist’.  I was already a feminist. My Mum and her Mum were feminists. I was born into it. So I never really had to think too much until he stood over me, his hands round my neck, squeezing, telling me what a ‘bitch’ I was.  I never had to think what ‘being a woman’ or ‘being a feminist’ means.  I will give him that. He and his violence really got me thinking.  After my assault, and my lonely journey through the legal procedure that followed, I naively thought I might be able to share some sisterhood and solidarity with other women who’d suffered violent attacks, including domestic violence and rape. But when I have tried to connect with women who campaign on violence against women, I repeatedly  get told  that because I have not been raped, I have no right to talk on this issue or to try and empathize with women who have.  Rape seems to hold a special symbolic position in the minds of these feminists and is treated as worse—but also somehow better—than all other violent crimes.  ♦◊♦  The term used to demonstrate the privileged position rape holds in feminist discourse is ‘rape culture.’ According to Melissa McEwan:      Rape culture is the myriad ways in which rape is tacitly and overtly abetted and encouraged having saturated every corner of our culture so thoroughly that people can’t easily wrap their heads around what the rape culture actually is. (My emphasis.)  Far more important than my own feeling of exclusion from feminist campaigns and groupings around gender violence is the countless number of other people who get attacked and killed in our society, who are not acknowledged by the concept of ‘rape culture’. Have you ever heard a feminist say that we live in ‘transphobic assault’ culture? Or ‘murder of young black men’ culture? Or ‘homophobia’ culture? Or even ‘domestic violence’ culture?  I haven’t. Incidentally domestic violence is far more common than rape, and can also include rape. But it just doesn’t seem to impress the feminists who believe in rape culture. They are welcome to their victim top trumps, but I am not playing anymore.  When I say rape is ‘privileged’ in feminist discourse, I don’t mean that it benefits anybody. I believe that by focusing on the centrality of rape in our culture, feminists are actually making it more difficult for all of us to campaign against all forms of gendered violence in society.  Trying to work out ‘why’ these feminists do this is difficult.  My instinct is, that holding onto ‘special victim’ status has some pay offs for feminists. They can continue to present gender politics as a binary opposition between ‘men’ (potential rapists) and ‘women’ (perpetual potential victims of rape). Basically, the concept of ‘rape culture’ is misandrist, and it does not allow for the fact that women are sometimes perpetrators of sexual assault, and men are sometimes on the receiving end.  ♦◊♦  I’d like to quote somebody who left a comment on a previous essay of mine about this topic. This woman is a survivor of rape, so the rad-fems won’t be able to dismiss her critique of rape culture the way they do mine:      This mythologizing of rape is still rooted in the whole “pedestal” complex, IMHO, and thus rapists are EVIL and women who get raped are spiritually/psychologically disfigured for LIFE and blah blah blah. The “rape culture” paradigm, while clearly meant as helpful critique and containing valuable cultural insight, seems to carry on that tradition.  The term ‘rapist’ is one I am not comfortable with using at all, if I can help it. I know I am in a tiny minority, as I see the word splashed across the newspapers on a regular basis, and I hear it being used widely in conversations about rape. The reason I don’t like the word ‘rapist’ is that I think it serves to undermine our attempts to tackle rape and sexual violence. This is because it pathologizes people who commit rape, portraying them in our culture as ‘monsters’ and ‘hate figures.’ This leads to a situation where we place rapists pretty near the top of a hierarchy of evil characters (maybe just behind ‘pedophiles’), so that in fact, it is actually very difficult to prosecute for rape. If ‘rapists’ are these inhuman monstrous characters, it is not surprising that courts up and down the country are reluctant to convict the thousands of people who commit rape each year.  I have received criticism for my view, particularly from feminists who argue that survivors of sexual violence need the term ‘rapist’ to enable them to name their attacker, proceed with seeking justice, and ultimately to get over their ordeal. But I believe that just as we have changed our terminology from talking about ‘victims’ to ‘survivors’ of rape, we also need to change how we label perpetrators. When I hear the word ‘rapist’ I think of a man, and not a man who is capable of change, of reflection. We have to speak about and talk to men who commit sexual assault as if they are able to change, and we also must acknowledge men are not the only perpetrators, if we want to reduce sexual and intimate partner violence in society.  Rape Culture is a myth. I reject it outright. ",♦

t5_2qh1i,macblastoff,1365621988,"*Caution:  Deep enough into the weeds here to editorialize and not detract from the thread--wall o' text follows.*  But see, that's the point--the thing that my wife categorically states as being the main force pulling her to live in America is the concept of possibility.  She felt so out of place in Germany because there is much less aspiration to greatness in the middle class.  Her own parents were an example--their advice: Study, get 1's, go to university, get a good job, retire on your pension.  In America, there is a much higher awareness in the middle class that the path to economic (and thus, personal) freedom is through business ownership.  What does that create?  Usually, jobs.  And not for nothing, but many, many of the presidents, CEOs, and upper management of large, successful companies got there because of forfeited weekends, long hours, and risk taking.  It's too easy to lump all of them, including the .01%, conveniently into the same pile of entitled, born into wealth takers, of which I personally believe there are very few, never having been to the Hamptons during summer myself.  On the contrary, I believe there are many who use their wealth for good, for social change, and yet still get vilified for nothing more than jealousy.  This opportunity isn't a panacea, and needs to be taken to exist in the first place--otherwise it's as valuable as paper gain on an invesment.  There are *so* many things that would be better in America if a little *Ordnung* were brought to bear.  Problem is, as my wife is sooo fond of hearing me chuckle when she says it, ""When I'm Queen of America, things'll run better!""  Gross generalization alert here, but just as no one wants to be a waiter/waitress in Germany (euphemism for want to be served, not make money doing the serving), Americans are soooooo enamored of their hard earned constitutional freedoms (sarcasm alert--we're well over 200 years from the War of Independence, so todays generations haven't felt a pinch, except those being legitimately denied equal protection under the Constitution) that they resist any organizational construct for fear of having their precious free toes trod upon.  Most people *want* to work because no other option was presented them and the discomfort level of getting up to drive/take the bus to work is less than that of starting a business.  There really isn't much difference between Germany's and American middle class other than the Americans know better and *still* do the same ole shit.  That being said, I heartily agree racism is still a present issue, and more insidious, as for the most part, racists have gone underground in open conversation.  As for the jobs that are available, they pay *exactly* enough, by definition.  If someone is willing to do that job, for that pay, then it is enough--enough to get someone to discomfort themselves every day, get dressed, leave their home/family, not go to the beach/park/library/bar but to an office, or a restaurant, or a school, etc.  There is no rule that says an employer cannot pay more for a set of skills someone brings to the table--and in fact, that is a common tactic used for work force retention, compared to the cost of retraining and lack of productivity during replacement.  That lifestyle is perfectly fine for ~~many~~ most, just don't ascribe any sinister plot that ""the ~~man~~ .01% is keeping me down!""  That is universal to the middle class of most 1st world countries, and worse yet, the white population of America does it to themselves voluntarily without few of the hurdles that realistically impact minorities.  In the interest of full-disclosure, there is nothing wrong with wanting a handout--I don't fault those who either a) legitimately need assistance, have been negatively impacted in their lives through no fault of their own, or b) have paid into an Unemployment Insurance/retirement/pension system and are withdrawing that investment legitimately while actively seeking work/living their retired lives.  The problem is when it becomes expected, and no desire to either find a job or start a business is present.  The easier it is to take a handout than find a job, the more likely that entitlements will increase.  That's why investment rather than divestment in foreign countries to help control foreign policy is abhorrent to some, yet financially prudent--increasing foreign aid and threatening to withdraw it has always been much more fiscally responsible than waging war, let alone more humanitarian to the civilians and soldiers.  There's no denying that many financial companies were ""let off the hook"" in the last few years, not to mention the last couple of centuries.  But I ask who is to decide what is right and wrong in such clusterfucks?  The Queen of America?  There isn't a clear cut right and wrong in this case, much the same way most Americans can barely spell Bosnia-Herzogovina, let alone follow the legacy between the areas' factions over the centuries.  If it's not black and white (but in Technicolor ®), fit's into 42 mins 30 secs, and has a to be continued, it doesn't maintain our attention.  Much like an idea for a business.  Business is *hard*, whether here, or worse yet, legislated to death in ~~California~~ Germany.",®

t5_2qh5j,barsoap,1365622390,"I... agree, though for completeness' sake I have to add that scrutinising and agitation can have negative effects, in certain cases. In Germany e.g. there's female hackers being seriously pissed at some feminists because before those raised awareness from the outside, they were just hackers among other hackers, even if a minority, and now they're raw eggs. That is, while the initial objective was laudable (care about the seriously low percentage of women in IT) the diagnosis was, generally speaking, dead wrong (assuming cultural misgony *within the local hacker culture* instead of considering that the numbers might have other causes) and the result was fallout (instead of increasing the number of women in IT, splitting the culture into different sub-groups along gender lines).  In general, radical feminism (now in your definition) seems to have a problem with people who say ""thanks but no thanks, I'm fine, I don't want you to 'liberate' me, fuck off"".  In the end, though, all I wanted to slam was the notion that ""women can't be sexist"" is feminist consensus. It's everything but, in particular, it hinges on denying or perverting intersectionality, bending the definitions of terms such that patriarchy is The One And Only Evil In The World™.",™

t5_2s7tt,Tekless,1365633104,"USA TODAY  Dec 26, 2012,  p. A.8   Copyright © Dec 26, 2012 USA Today Information Network. All rights reserved. Reprinted with permission.    Guns in Schools Can Save Lives  By John R Lott, Jr.       Has anyone noticed that these mass shootings at public schools increased after the 1995 Gun-Free School Zone Act? Passed with good intentions, banning guns would supposedly make schools safer.   But law abiding citizens, not criminals, obey these bans. Instead of making places safer, disarming law abiding citizens left them sitting ducks.   Killers go where victims can't defend themselves. In the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting, out of seven theaters showing the Batman movie premiere within 20 minutes of the suspect's apartment, only one banned permitted concealed handguns. The suspect didn't go to the closest nor the largest, but to the one that banned self-defense. Time after time the story is the same.   With just one exception, every public mass shooting in the USA since at least 1950 has taken place where citizens are banned from carrying guns. Despite strict gun regulations, Europe has had three of the worst six school shootings.   Sometimes, permit holders save lives. Joel Myrick, an assistant high school principal in Pearl, Miss., used to carry his permitted handgun at school, but stopped after the 1995 act passed. When his school was attacked in October 1997, he ran a mile to get his gun stored off school property, and still stopped the attack 11 minutes before police arrived. Before 1996, he could have stopped it sooner.   More than 8.5 million Americans can legally carry concealed handguns. They are next to us in restaurants, movie theaters and stores. Permit holders are law abiding, committing firearms violations at a rate of hundredths of 1%.   Before the 1995 act, states allowing concealed carry let permit holders carry guns in schools. In four states, they still can. No problems ever reported.   As a compromise, over the past 15 years more than 12,000 former military members have gone into public schools teaching through ""Troops to Teachers."" Let them carry.   Still in doubt? Ask yourself: Would you feel safer with a sign on your house saying ""this house is a gun-free zone""? But if you wouldn't put these signs on your home, why put them elsewhere?  John R. Lott Jr. is a former chief economist for the U.S. Sentencing Commission and the author of More Guns, Less Crime.  TL;DR: if you are pro gun control go fuck yourself youre doing more harm than good.

This story is exactly like the stories you get in tribal oral tradition, where materialism is discussed (good), then saying God is more important than materialism (hmm...)  Obviously I don't agree with the moral of the story (duh), but an example of an alternative with the same (more moral) format would be:  ------------------  One day, a rich father took his son on a trip. He wanted to show him how poor someone can be.  They spent time on the farm of a poor family.  On the way home, father asked, did you see how poor they are? What did you learn? The son said...we have a pool, they have rivers. We have lanterns at night, they have stars.  Our cooks make our food, they grow theirs as a family. We have walls to protect us, they have friends. We have encyclopedias, they have Attenborough and the internet.   Then he added: thanks Dad for showing me how poor we are.  *Lesson: It's not simply money that makes us wealthy, it's about putting love and loving first.*  If each exmoose does the macarena and likes it on Youtube, in a few seconds 50 million will have done the macarena and it may calm Kim Jong Un's anger ☺",☺

t5_2qh6c,Raven_skies,1365645337,"Get your downvote buttons ready, because this one is going to be unpopular on what is a decidedly pro premarital sex thread... Exodus 22:16 New International Version (©2011) ""If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.  While this is old Testiment law, we can extrapolate a concept here that states that as far as morality is concerned, marriage and sex are intrinsically linked. Notice he did not rape the girl, but seduced her (rape is covered elsewhere, but that passage is beyond the scope of my point). The people who are impacted by this verse may be in a caring relationship and hot for each other. Also, if a man seduces a girl who is not a virgin, she is either A) married, and he is sleeping with another man's wife, or B) unmarried technically, but should be married according to the law to whomever did sleep with her first.  This is likely the cultural norm that existed in Jesus' day, and we would be right in assuming that this law would be the benchmark for the Jewish understanding of premarital sex. Also, as Paul was an elite Jew himself, we can also assume with confidence that he would observe this concept that you can't ahem... get the milk for free if you don't buy the cow.  As this is the 21st century, let's modernize the verse: If anyone seduces a virgin to whom they are not pledged to be married and sleeps with him/her, he or she must marry the one who was seduced.  Edit: added the word 'may be'",©

t5_2qk1b,StarTrackFan,1365646463,"Haha, here is OP's brilliant analysis of DPRK that got them banned from r/communism:  &gt;Why do we continue to defend these monarchist fools! They do not represent the ideals of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels!  That's the entire comment. This kind of tripe is unneeded, useless and it's not some brave attack -- it's just baseless insults and dogmatic adherence to what they think Marx/Engels ""ideals"" were. It shows no understanding at all of what they attack. And yes, you're right that people in r/communism don't ""defend"" DPRK as some perfect society or even as having Marxist leadership -- they simply think North Korea should have self-determination and that invasion or external meddling by imperialists is not just bad -- but a big part of the problems they face (obviously this is my opinion of the general trend -- r/communism isn't one entity, but I've never seen anyone ""support"" it like KingHenrik seems to think). People like OP have been taught to mindlessly hate DPRK so any analysis that isn't mindless denunciation seems like full support or love for it.  And would you like to see OP's brilliant attack on the ""crimes Stalin committed"" in /r/communism101?  &gt;Under Josef Stalin, I believe that through his counter revolutionary movement and his purges he made it less socialistic and more fascistic.  Again, simple insults with no explanation, no histmat analysis etc -- nothing of value added at all, no knowledge or understanding displayed.   OP sucks. They were not making serious or thoughtful comments at all, it's basically spam. It's comical that they seem to think they're some insightful martyr for whatever they think ""True Marxism™"" is. I'm very glad they're banned and can't spam garbage in those subs anymore.",™

t5_2rfxx,irelia_of_ionia,1365673259,"""  First off, you’ve deserved a response to this thread for a long time, and I’m sorry we haven’t been able to give you one until now. We’ve been well aware of how the Dominion and TT communities have felt left behind and ignored, but we wanted to make sure we had a plan that we were confident in and committed to before commenting, because we don’t want to make any more empty promises.  Dominion’s fun (it’s fast). So is Twisted Treeline. But they both share one key problem – League of Legends is competitively balanced for Classic gameplay on Summoner’s Rift. Our original goal was to create rulesets that would result in balanced experiences across all game modes with the same champion stats. We’ve experimented with itemization, game pacing, map features, and other design elements. While we’ve had limited success here, there’s still room for improvement, so we’re going to take the plunge: in the near future™, we’re going to be implementing map-specific balance changes for individual champions.  This is going to take a few patches to implement, but we’re actively working on the tech, and we’re already got a bunch of specific balance changes in mind that we’re iterating on. We’re sure there will be lots of questions regarding the initiative, so we’ll announce more specifics when the time comes. I’ll actually be joining the live design team to head up map-specific balance for TT and Dominion. Remember that this is just the foundation for support - we’ve got some other tentative plans that we’re exploring to enhance both maps farther down the line! """,™

You are just that great of a human being.  My bf says that I have perked up a lot since finding everyone here, and it's true. I never thought making friends this way would be the same as meeting friends IRL but it is, and it's allowed me to meet people like you who I would have never found otherwise. I appreciate you so much and I just...I hope you realise just how loved you are. &lt;3  ( ˘ ³˘)♥ Thanks for everything, Sushi. You are honey in human form.",♥

Fans of the Star Wars™ films will surely remember these on Tatooine in A New Hope. What are the macrobinoculars and what can players do with them? This new system allows players to scan and analyze objects far out in the distance, uncovering hidden objects and revealing interesting details about them. There may even be a reward for finding certain hidden objects!    &gt;A brand new storyline will come with this new system, as players use the macrobinoculars to track down a dangerous new enemy known only as the Shroud. Players will return to previously explored planets and discover new threats, as they seek more information on the Shroud’s intricate plan. What is the Shroud up to? How will it affect the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire? Be prepared to put on your thinking cap, as the Shroud is a mastermind when it comes to protecting his plans. Players will need to overcome obstacles in their path, and we don’t just mean new and tough enemies.

I know _s does everything The Wordpress Way™, but for me the template files get a bit confusing and over complicated.  I also like that Bones has SASS all set up, along with a pretty good media query system with IE8 and below specific styles  Bones also has quite a few nice functions tweaks like cleaning up the &lt;head&gt; section of all the generated nonsense that nobody really uses anymore, stripping &lt;p&gt; tags form images (why the hell WP still does this by default is beyond me), cleaning up the dashboard screens, registering menus, default custom post type setup, etc.  For me Bones is ""just right"", while _s is a bit bare. I tried the Roots theme and it was at the other end, with too may assumptions made and too much baked into it for my liking.  It all comes down to personal preference, of course.

So, what's wrong with doing it that way, according to the commenters:  **It's insecure because you can't see the code before running it because it's piped.**      Well, that makes it exactly as insecure as every unsigned binary you ever downloaded. Or, let's be honest, every shell script, python script, perl script etc you have ever downloaded. Or you audit them?  Who exactly is being prevented from auditing it by having it presented this way? Is the intersection of ""people who can audit this script"" and ""pople who don't understand pipes"" not empty?  For those who can audit, this makes no difference. For those who can't audit, this makes no difference.  **It would be better if I provided a hash of the file to know it's not tampered**       And how would you know the hash is not tampered? What you want, really is a digital signature of the script.  If you trust google (and usually, people do), then you know that:  a. The script was uploaded by me (check the history of the file).          b. The script has not been tampered from the repo (since it's a secure connection and yes, there is a hash of the revision)  If you don't trust google, then you don't know who uploaded it, and if you don't trust me, you don't care who uploaded it, even if it's signed (because it's signed by someone you don't trust).  **How does the user know it's not malware?**       He doesn't. Life is like that.  **Why should the user trust you?**     He shouldn't. OTOH, were he so inclined, he can check who wrote it, and that I am a real person, with a long history of sharing code online and no claims of ever pushing malware.  **This is more insecure because it downloads on every run**      You don't need to run malware more than once, anyway. So, not much of a difference.  **This propagates bad habits.**       So does Dunkin' Donuts, and noone posts about it at reddit. But in any case, sure, it's a bad habit. Big deal.         So, is it secure? Hell no! Is it significantly less secure than installing a random PPA you see mentioned in a forum? Maybe slightly. Is it less secure than running random unsigned binaries? Hell no. Is it less secure than downloading and running it? No. Is it less secure than building a random thing from source? Hell no.  But is it less secure than the other realistic ways in which I can give you a 100+ line chunk of python code that works as a web browser? I don't think so.  In the context of ""here's the code for it, it can do this"", this is not significantly insecure. It's more or less as insecure as the alternatives. With the advantage that, if you want, you can audit it. It's 128 lines of code (assuming you trust Qt and PyQt and Python, etc)  So there.  ← Previous post    Contents © 2000-2013 Roberto Alsina Share on moreShare  -------------  Edit:     Why would you downvote me for adding sourced information that's clearly relevant to the discussion and helps it and helps people follow the issues?

These are made from a tough brand of denim &gt;in a rub test conducted by CORDURA® (Martindale Abrasion BS EN ISO 12947-2:1999 Standard Woolen Abrasion with 12KPa weight), regular 100% cotton denim held up to between 75'000 to 25'000 rubs (depending on number of times the denim was washed) compared to the same weight CORDURA® denim where they stopped the tests at 250'000 rubs on all samples because the denim was just not wearing through.  Jeans made from these in a utility cut start at $40 from other vendors. If they're adding some stretch, a better cut and other reinforcements then the price starts to make sense.  ",®

t5_2sjdn,sailthetethys,1365725518,"Hi ♥      First and foremost, you're right. There *is* only so much you can do, and it sounds like you're doing it by supporting him during his transition. I'm sure you know that suicidal thoughts are pretty common among transgender folks, so any sort of acceptance/support from loved ones he gets goes a long way. However, it can only go so far, and the decision is ultimately up to him to get help.       I know you feel that you're being selfish by asking him to stay alive, but you have to consider your own mental health and well-being as well. Severe depression tends to inhibit your ability to realize anything beyond your own misery, which can lead to unintentional self-centered behavior. By refusing to see a therapist (especially a gender therapist, who'd specialize in what he's going through) and refusing to take steps to treat his depression, he's not considering  the people who love him and need him in their lives. Can you talk to a few members of his family that he has a close relationship with? Maybe really sit down, on one of his better days, and let him know how much he means to you and how devastated you'd be if you lost him. Let him know how much this guilt and fear is hurting you. Ask him to see a counselor, not for himself, but for you - or offer to go to one together. And please talk to a counselor yourself, or call a hotline and ask for advice (I did the same thing when my best friend threatened to commit suicide). This type of thing is too big for you to handle alone, you need support too!",♥

t5_2u489,trixx1,1365727268,"&gt;Revelation 3:14 ""And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‘The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation."" The word ""beginning"" does not actually mean Jesus had a beginning or a moment of creation. This is a misinterpretation of the English translation. The Greek word arche means ""first in position"" or ""leader"". It can also be translated as ""origin"" or ""cause"". Jesus is not saying he had a beginning, but that he is the Creator of all creation, that he has authority over all creation since he is Beginning (Revelation 22:13). This verse actually supports the deity of Jesus!   To me this interpetation is forced. One person who prefers this idea is the noted Greek scholar Henry Alford. Nevertheless, in his work The Greek Testament, Alford concedes: “The mere word arkhé would admit the meaning that Christ is the first created being: see Genesis 49:3; Deut. 21:17; and Prov. 8 22. And so the Arians here take it, and some who have followed them”  According to The Expositor’s Greek Testament, to understand Revelation 3:14 as meaning that Jesus is “the active source” of creation, rather than the first created person, one must interpret arkhé “as in Greek philosophy and [non-Biblical] Jewish wisdom-literature,=aitía or origin.” The inspired Bible writers, however, never borrowed ideas from Greek philosophy.  But how could Jesus be a creature if “in him all things were created”? At times the Bible uses the word “all” in a way that allows for exceptions. For example, we read at 1 Corinthians 15:27: “But when it says, ‘All things are put in subjection under him [Jesus Christ],’ it is plain that he [God] is excepted who put all things under him.” As a further illustration the Bible states that “through one man,” Adam, “death spread to all men.” (Rom. 5:12) Though Adam was not part of the “all men” to whom death “spread” (since previous to Adam there was no human who could have spread death to him), he was nonetheless a man. Similarly, though Jesus was not part of the “all things” that came into existence through him, he was, nevertheless, a created person, the very first creature of God. The Greek word panta in certain contexts means “all other,” as in 1 Corinthians 15:24 and 6:18. (See An American Translation, Moffatt, Common Bible.) Hence, the New World Translation reads: “by means of him all other things were created . . . he is before all other things.”—Col. 1:16, 17.  &gt;The JW think the English translation ""firstborn"" literally means that Jesus was the first being created. This is a misinterpretation. Again, looking into the original language will illuminate the true meaning. The Greek word, prōtotokos is not a noun, but an adjective. The word ""firstborn"" in this verse does not refer to a physical birth, but refers to Jesus' position to inherit the creation.  Before Colossians 1:15, the expression “the firstborn of” occurs upwards of 30 times in the Bible, and in each instance that it is applied to living creatures the same meaning applies—the firstborn is part of the group. “The firstborn of Israel” is one of the sons of Israel; “the firstborn of Pharaoh” is one of Pharaoh’s family; “the firstborn of beast” are themselves animals. What, then, causes you to ascribe a different meaning to it at Colossians 1:15? Since this is the only one of the 30 whose meaning you want to change, I have to conclude you're doing it in order to support a a belief you hold. The Bible is clear, Jesus is the first born of all creation.If the Trinity doctrine is true, why are the Father and the holy spirit not also said to be the firstborn of all creation? But the Bible applies this expression only to the Son.   &gt;Again the JW's like to take things out of context because the very next verse (18) contradicts Jesus as a created being. ""18 And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent."" We also get a definition of ""firstborn"" when the verse says ""that in everything he might be preeminent"", meaning that he is first place in everything.  I don't know how that proves Jesus wasn't created. Preiminent as defined by dictionary.com - ""eminent above or before others; superior; surpassing"". It says nothing about Jesus not being created.   &gt;Proverbs 8:22-31 ""“The Lord possessed[b] me at the beginning of his work"" ... Notice how his version, which is no doubt the New World Translation, says ""produced"", rather than ""possessed"". One implies that Jesus was created, the other simply supports what the rest of the Bible says -- that Jesus created the universe! My version is from the English Standard Version, which is one of the most accurate translations to date. Here is a prime example of the use of deception by the JW's.   Notice that you are calling the translation in the NWT deceptive without even discussing the original Hebrew word. I have some more translations you could add to your list of ""deceptive translations:  New International Version (©2011) ""The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old;  New Living Translation (©2007) ""The LORD formed me from the beginning, before he created anything else.  Holman Christian Standard Bible (©2009) The LORD made me at the beginning of His creation, before His works of long ago.  International Standard Version (©2012) ""The LORD made me as he began his planning, before his ancient activity commenced.  NET Bible (©2006) The LORD created me as the beginning of his works, before his deeds of long ago.  Aramaic Bible in Plain English (©2010) “Lord Jehovah created me at the beginning of his creation and from before all of his works.”   There's many more but that should sufficiently demonstrate my point. But let me return to Prov 8 and this time I will use your favorite translation - ESV:  Ages ago **I was set up**,     at the first, before the beginning of the earth. 24 When there were no depths **I was brought forth**,     when there were no springs abounding with water. 25 Before the mountains had been shaped,     before the hills, **I was brought forth**, 26 before he had made the earth with its fields,     or the first of the dust of the world.  This scripture also supports what's expressed in Col 1: 15-17. While Jesus was created, he was the very first created being that had a key role as the ""master worker"" of creation. No doubt, he's the very person Jehovah spoke to in Genesis when he said, ""let us make man in our image"".",©

t5_2r4w1,Zi1djian,1365735136,"Where?  As far as I can tell nothing has changed on the page you have linked with this ad. Or if you have changed it, it still isn't clear enough. It should state, as the first thing on that page, that your beta client isn't available yet. Even an ETA is better than *soon™*. There is still nothing on that page about the commission you take--you're essentially tricking people into signing up for a service without giving them a full description of what they're getting into. I still think 20% is far too high for testing purposes. You should seriously reconsider lowering that until you have a finalized product that is proven to be stable and work. It's a huge turn-off to see that number after you've registered.  When you have a beta test, you want your users to be very inclined to use your product and actually do some testing. Instead, this looks like you've constructed a system to crowd-source bitcoin mining via your program and cash out by taking an enormous commission. Ease of use is nice and all, but most people who are taking an interest in bitcoin mining, and *actually want to start doing it* have enough technical know-how to get it working with the systems already in place. Are you trying to appeal to a market of consumers who don't fully understand how bitcoin works? If so, why?   I can guarantee that you are losing sign-ups and interest on these premises alone. I was gung-ho when I saw this the first time, and now even if it were to release tomorrow, I'd be skeptical about using it. You all need to be completely transparent with your testing base. It takes practically nothing these days for the internet to destroy a company's reputation for shady business practices. ",™

t5_2qh1i,Bacon4EVER,1365742050,"**Desiderata**   Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.   As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.   Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.   Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.   But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.     Be yourself.   Especially, do not feign affection.   Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.      Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.   Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.   Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.   Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.     **You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.   And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.**   Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be,   and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.   With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful.   Strive to be happy.     © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2qhc8,Merad,1365743929,"Ok, I'll bite.  The following is *in my opinion* based on experience owning a Glock 19 and Springfield Range Officer 1911 (plus my infallible knowledge as a certified internet commentator™).  * **Accuracy: 1911** Mechanically both guns are accurate enough that roughly 99.5% of shooters can't use them to their full potential.  The 1911 has a better trigger without a doubt, and because of that most people are probably going to shoot it better. * **Recoil: Tie** I mean honestly, I can't tell a significant difference between my 1911 and G19.  I suppose followup shots are faster/easier on the Glock but the difference is not huge. * **Reliability: Glock**  [Glock torture test](http://theprepared.com/content/view/90//administrator/), 'nuff said.  Certainly 1911's can be reliable (look at the wars they've gone through), but any random 1911 has to be regarded as a question mark IMO, while any random Glock is very likely to function fine even if dirty, lacking lube, etc. * **Durability: Tie** Like most other guns of reasonable quality either should easily outlive its owner. * **Takedown: Glock** The 1911 isn't exactly hard, but any idiot can field strip a Glock in 2 seconds after seeing it done once.  I'd feel reasonably comfortable trying to detail strip a Glock for repairs, because it's just so simple inside.  The 1911 isn't very complex compared to some guns, but it's more than I'd tackle without help. * **Size: Glock**  The Glock is thicker, lighter, and smaller, the 1911 is thinner, heavier, and larger.  Of course, this is comparing a full size 1911 against a compact Glock. * **Capacity: Glock** 16 9mm vs 8 .45.  You do the math.  Overall I feel like the 1911 is a fine design, but its age shows.  It's plenty of fun and certainly is useful to some people, but for me the Glock has more advantages.  YMMV, get whichever you prefer.",™

t5_2s7tt,justagirl90210,1365752767,"I know this site is full of dumb kids, and I'm getting sick of explaining it, but here we go again:  1. Famous people are just like regular people; most of them are boring.  2. Consciously or subconsciously, your perception of celebrities is an amalgam of the person and the person's work. You don't perceive Morgan Freeman. You perceive Morgan Freeman and the guy in Shawshank and the guy in Se7en all rolled into one identity. All the interesting things about their work get mixed up with the actual person. This is dangerous thinking because it leads to misconceptions. People are NOT their work.  3. Celebrities such as Morgan Freeman don't like you. They don't want to communicate with you. If they're here in any form whatsoever, they're shilling something. The Jeopardy guy doing an AMA? Oh. He was trying to sell his book. Woody doing an AMA? Oh. He was trying to sell his movie. What a shocker. Morgan Freeman has a new movie coming out. I didn't see that one coming. You mean he didn't just drop in because he wanted to chat with you? You're so awesome to chat with on the internet that I can't imagine he'd need any other reason to hang out here. What I found hilarious about this advertisement was that they didn't even try to hide it. His (supposedly) account name WAS THE NAME OF THE FUCKING MOVIE. They didn't even PRETEND this was anything other than an advertisement.  4. Relatively speaking, very few humans are actually technologically savvy. Morgan Freeman can't play video games. He doesn't understand them. They don't make sense to him. He doesn't understand internet memes. He's not a competent typist, so he can't quickly respond to questions with in-depth answers. He has no interest in this. He doesn't get it. You can't expect the quality of his output here to be anything but poor.  5. All these ""real world"" celebrities are out of their element here. Think about it. What's Morgan Freeman's most appealing characteristic? His voice. This is a PURE TEXT forum. This is NOT playing to his strengths. It doesn't play to most ""real world"" celebrities' strengths, either, because they tend to be nothing more than GOOD LOOKING AND BORING. They have nothing interesting to say. They're not particularly intelligent. They're not insightful. You know who excels on the internet? Someone like John Carmack. He has NO charisma, an annoying voice with a speech impediment, and guess GODDAMNIT WHAT? Interesting things flood out of his keyboard like a tidal wave. Putting Morgan Freeman on Reddit is like asking John Carmack to host the Oscars. It's a joke.  6. Because they DON'T get it, they treat the internet like just another one of their PR tour stops. Have you ever noticed that virtually EVERY AMA response from a celebrity is generic bullshit that anyone could have pulled off Wikipedia? It's because by-the-numbers-bullshit™ is how celebrities treat PR in traditional mediums. These shills tell every talk show host the same stories, and they nod their heads and keep repeating the same crap. It's a farce, because even though repeating the same bullshit might work on a controlled, rehearsed TV program like Jay Leno's, it doesn't fucking fly on the internet.  7. The truly intelligent shills have identified the best way to milk the internet. It's the kinder, gentler approach. You purposely go out of your way to pretend like you're NOT trying to sell something. You do AMAs when you DON'T have a product to sell. You act like everyone's friend. You even give some stuff away for free to make it seem like you're just in it for the love of the game. In the long haul, this builds customer loyalty and you end up making even more money than you do with the Woody Harrelson approach. Smart shills like Gabe Newell at Valve figured out that PR on the internet is nothing like traditional PR, and that's why everyone thinks that Gaben is a benevolent Jesus while EA is a blood-sucking vampire. This is in spite of the fact that Valve is just as dirty and evil as EA. They love you so much, yet they took advantage of your enthusiasm for Half-Life 2 as a means to force Steam, their shitty online DRM product, on you. Half-Life 2 wasn't a game--you know that, right? It was a Trojan horse for Steam.  8. If the majority of people on this site had any self respect, none of these blatant ADVERTISEMENTS (because that's all they are) would ever get upvoted. These shills should all get run off the internet.  Don't you assholes fucking get it? TV is locked down and owned by large corporate interests. We have no say in it. The internet is a different animal because WE directly create the majority of the content on it. It's in our control. The internet is supposed to be about people communicating on a global network. PEOPLE. Not Hollywood shills. It isn't supposed to be ANOTHER FUCKING BUS STOP on Morgan fucking Freeman's movie PR tour. Why are you tolerating this? FUCK Morgan Freeman and Hollywood.  DON'T pollute my internet with this HORSESHIT, ACTUALLY.",™

A few tips for a beginner—from someone who's only *really* been playing the game for two and half months… after a 6 year hiatus:  * Follow the hitch-hiker's guide philosophy: [**don't panic!**](http://f.cl.ly/items/1t1E2S1O3a0r2G3W2541/sfw%20animated%20monkey%20astronaut%20freakout.gif)  [(And always carry a towel.)](http://f.cl.ly/items/2b0G3O1P1n1B220z1p2s/sfw%20fighter%20jet%20plane%20missiles%20shitshit%20extra%20plexmobile%20eve.jpg)  EVE protects you in a number of subtle ways when undocking, warping, or jumping through gates… and sometimes doing nothing at all can save your life.  Even then, [death is part of the EVE experience.](http://f.cl.ly/items/2X2t460e2P0M0g2G0v2e/sfw%20captioned%20demotivational%20%22star%20wars%22%20stormtrooper.jpg)  If you undock it, it will explode gloriously, and conversely don't undock anything you can't afford to lose or replace.  (Often nice people will help you replace your losses if you post a killmail and ask nicely.) * This will contradict the next point, but early on try out everything.  Initially you won't be the best at anything, but you should be able to get a feel for the different roles.  Try out mining, read up on manufacture to see if that could be your thing, try out combat and support roles—healers are always welcome and don't take that long to get started with—even play around with the market.  (Just remember: buy low, sell high!)  As Hail Sagan mentioned, a great way to learn is to try out different fits and get blown up.  *A lot.* * Find the one thing you are most interested in after the above… and specialize.  Do you like to fly in there, balls-to-the-wall, tackling enemies to prevent them from escaping the vengeance of the horde?  Love getting right in the middle of everything, blasting away?  Or at 200KM range?  Like keeping your newfound friends alive?  Enjoy frustrating your enemies when they can't lock or hit anything?  Love undercutting your enemies on the market and making huge ISKies?  Specialization will get you bootstrapped into a single, specific role more quickly and you may quickly find yourself indespensible! * **Get on comms.**  Don't be intimidated by some of the more exuberant people talking there, There Is No Mumble Elite™, and everyone is welcome.  I spent several hours straight last night just answering questions, and *many* of us enjoy helping new users learn the ropes.  (Note that there are certain channels, such as fleet channels, where questions in the heat of battle would be… less appreciated, however.)  Have a great time, and always remember to have fun!  (It's not about ISK efficiency / kill:death ratios, it's about fun per hour!)  Let's fly dangerous!  — *Dark Wing* Draleth",™

t5_2r0gj,Will_Power,1365785164,"As others like /u/JosefTheFritzl have pointed out, your comparison with the Catholic Church may not be completely appropriate because that church rose to prominence before the age of reason, and is experiencing its own exodus now.  Personally, I think the LDS church will be around for a good while to come; however, that doesn't mean that All Will Be Well in Zion™.  There are lots of organizations that grow, plateau, then contract.  Consider the corporate world as an example.  Corporations bloom under early visionaries, grow to the point where functionaries run the show, then eventually decline.  HP, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, are all examples from just one sector to illustrate that point.  The only thing the LDS church has going for it now is momentum.  What's interesting to note is how organizations deal with decline.  They never say, ""Oh!  It looks like we are losing more [customers, believers, citizens, etc.] than we are gaining.  Time to close up shop!""  They redouble their efforts, then redouble them again, but always have a fallback state.

Any use of the Android name must include footer attribution in your communications: ""Android is a trademark of Google Inc.""  However if you wanted to call your device an Android device, you would have to follow the guidelines of the Compatibility Definition Document by the Open Handset Alliance to the button, and that would mean shipping the product with Android.

I just wanted to say that you shouldn't feel shame about medication. Depression is a real illness. Mental health are real issues and sometimes the best way to treat those issues is through medication. There's no reason to feel shame about it.   I've been depressed myself for a really long time (and it actually began around the same time as you, 5-6th grade) and it wasn't until I was 23 that I finally had enough and decided to try medication and although I was only on it for a few months, it really helped me get out of what was the 'deepest' part of my depression. I saw a professional and talked with them once a week and it really helped me get a better grasp on this issue I have.   It's okay if you can't fix it alone. It's even okay if you can't fix it with religion and God. Even if you believe God performs medical miracles, you cannot fix everything this way...   Please just be open to receive help if you need it. Don't feel ashamed.   Sometimes depression goes in cycles. If you feel depressed again, please do not think it's because you don't believe in God strongly enough. Turn to professional help. :)   Be well. Take care of yourself ♥",♥

t5_2qi0a,pjmlp,1365789003,"MSIL is **never** executed, it just used as an intermediate format for the binaries.  The only .NET version that interprets MSIL instead of doing native code compilation is the Micro Framework.  If you cared to read at all the Wikipedia link, you would know that JIT means compilation on the fly to native code.  On Microsoft's case, code is always fully JITted, there is no interpretation phase like in many Java VM, which actually also allow for full JIT like .NET does.   &gt; Before you can run Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), it must be compiled against the common language runtime to native code for the target machine architecture.   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5532s8a%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#compiling_msil_to_native_code   Additionally you can compile to native code at installation time by making use of NGEN, if you install your assemblies signed into the GAC.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf%28v=vs.110%29.aspx  .NET applications for Windows Phone 8 are compiled to native code when uploaded to the Windows Store,  http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Mani-Ramaswamy-and-Peter-Sollich-Inside-Compiler-in-the-Cloud-and-MDIL  http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-005  Additionally Microsoft's research operating system Singularity provides a native code compiler for .NET named Bartok,  &gt; Moreover, Bartok translates from Microsoft® intermediate language (MSIL) into highly optimized x86 code. It performs interprocedural optimization to eliminate redundant run-time safety tests, reducing the cost of language safety.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163603.aspx  If you are targeting iOS with Mono you also get to compile to native code,  http://xamarin.com/how-it-works  There are also alternative OS like CosmOS that have a C# native compiler  http://cosmos.codeplex.com/  So, spend some time learning about how compilers work, and that languages and implementations are two different things.",®

t5_2qh4r,VinceFish,1365793392,"This is indeed a fair hypothesis and somewhat 'convinced' me back when I started reading into this and I was young and impressionable.   But that paper doesn't find evidence of a thermite reaction, or thermite in itself, rather the components of thermite. Comparable to finding some wires, and a clock, and assuming a bomb had been found.   http://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Equip/AlRefDataSheet.htm &gt;Aluminum readily extracts oxygen from other metal oxides to form aluminum oxide  http://www.chymist.com/Thermite%20reaction.pdf &gt;Fe2O3 + 2 Al → **Al2O3** + 2 Fe   There is no evidence of aluminium oxide in the samples (41%), clearly a reactant of an exothermic combustion, as we can see above.   Barium nitrate is another compound that would be found in thermite at 29% (http://www.dodtechmatch.com/DOD/Patent/PatentDetail.aspx?type=description&amp;id=6766744), but the paper doesn't find any evidence of this either.  The paper also makes a point of stating that what they found in the sample followed along and that he found these ""uncommon chemical elements in abundance"" in his samples.  The first point he makes is correct, but his claim that the chemicals were 'uncommon' is not. Iron, sulphur, aluminium, potassium, maganese, fluorine and titanium were said chemicals.  Iron is ridiculously abundant, used in paint and electronic devices and a huge amount of other things.  Sulphur was an abundant ingredient of the drywall that protected the three buildings.  Potassium exists in concrete (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/chem1/)  Manganese exists in the high strength manganese vanadium steel of the WTCs along with paint and batteries and numerous other things. (http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/chronic_rels/pdf/mangnREL.pdf)  Flourine is a component of Freon which was used in the air conditioning of the WTC (http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/wtc/analysis/asse_groundzero1.htm) &gt;Approximately 200,000 pounds of Freon® 22 refrigerant for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system  Titanium exists in paper and paint and is a component of the planes that hit the WTCs, along with WTC7 being cladded with the stuff.   So it's fair to say that this stuff was likely to be around in the dust of the WTCs, right?   The samples, also, weren't even collected from the sites of the WTC buildings either, instead from dust people had stored across the US, collected many years after the event, so contaminants are another cause of what the paper found.   Bentham science also isn't a very well regarded paper, people have submitted bullshit made up papers in the past and had them passed and 'peer reviewed' (http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal.html)   Even their wikipedia page kind of embarrasingly rips them apart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentham_Science_Publishers  So we can't be sure if this paper was even peer reviewed by other scientists at all.   I found all these links from just googling the claims made in this paper. Really wasn't that hard to fact check.",®

[citation needed] They give two citations, but they're both even weaker sauce than this. The first had a sample size &lt;10, excluded anyone receiving treatment, excluded anyone with suicidal ideation, was semi-blind only on the patient end, and appears to have been tested against simple talk therapy. It also wasn't about PTSD - that was one of nine different things they were testing with 10 patients.  The other they cite had a sample size of 5 with literally no controls.  This one goes through the motions of controls, but they're not very clear on how they enforced them, and they were rather incomplete:  &gt; Other issues, such as **injuries**, **nutrition**, **finances**, and religion, were not investigated.  They either didn't look at that, or they did and rejected it because it invalidated their pre-determined conclusions. If you doubt the conclusions were determined from the outset:   &gt; The study was approved by the institutional review board at the MUM Research Institute.  MUM = Maharishi University of Management. They also have ""studies"" showing that yogic fliers TMing in the area reduce the [crime rate](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1006978911496) of whole cities.  &gt; During the recruiting process—before instruction in TM—the randomization was broken... With randomization broken, the authors matched the 21 TM participants... with 21 of the 51 participants randomized to the delayed-start group.  Non-randomized. Test and control matching was done by the researchers.  &gt; Some test administrators, however, helped with other activities, and became familiar with some of the TM participants by the 30-day posttest and with most participants by the 90-day posttest.  Not successfully blinded. This introduced obvious reporting pressure on the part of the test group. The authors acknowledge the possibility of experiment demand effects, but rather unconvincingly handwave it away.  There's also the fact that, as Carl Sagan put it, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" They're claiming a 36 point reduction on the PCL-C in 30 days. It's much more likely that something is funky with the study than that they've found a treatment more effective in a month than long-term exposure therapy.  ^^^Why ^^^do ^^^I ^^^do ^^^this ^^^to ^^^myself?",®

I worked there for four years, and then got fired due to the old director hating my guts and looking desperately for a reason to fire me...and I overslept one day and was crazy late...and he fired me because of it.  But he got fired last July, and by the end of August, I had my job back.  I guess if I just had to pick one animal I'd pick an octopus as my favorite.  They're smart, colorful, and REALLY FREAKING COOL.  As far as breeds...hmm...Newfoundland dogs...and solid black cats.  :3    Favorite story from my time at the shelter...that's really tough.  Most of my happy ones are boring, just like...a couple weekends ago we had two REALLY CUTE chihuahua puppies go up for adoption on a Saturday morning, and we had a huge line at the door when we opened...and they were there for older, way less adoptable dogs that I had just put up on Petfinder the previous day.  The puppies got adopted, but later in the day and not by people who had just spontaneously seen them and wanted them 'cuz they were cute.   A not-so-happy, but crazy one...I adopted a cat to an older gentleman who seemed totally normal, his application was fine, who later brought the cat back...because he had to go into a mental hospital for dementia.  He had apparently been attempting to walk the poor cat on a leash, and he couldn't understand why it wasn't working well...and when he left, he told us not to worry about him, because he was IRON MAN~!!  And he opened his button-up flannel shirt to show that he was wearing a pair of Iron Man pajamas underneath his clothes.    I adopted a cat to a certifiably insane man.  I was so freaked out about doing adoptions for the longest time after that.  Lately the crazies have been better about identifying themselves, though.  :)",♥

t5_2qh13,lushcrushn14,1365818973,"Springhill Care Group Korea Free Alzheimer’s Training Available in all 50 States to Support Family Caregivers Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal, progressive and degenerative disease that destroys brain cells. It is the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is not a normal part of aging. Symptoms include having difficulty remembering things, making decisions and performing everyday activities. These changes can affect the way a person feels and acts. There is currently no way to stop the disease, but research is improving the way provide care and will continue to search for a cure. Americans fear developing Alzheimer’s disease more than any other major life-threatening disease, including cancer, stroke, heart disease and diabetes according to OMAHA, Neb. – November 13, 2012 – Home Instead Senior Care®, the world’s leading provider of home care services for seniors, announced new survey results. More than 1,200 Americans was designed to gain perspective on the most pressing concerns associated with Alzheimer’s, including diagnosis and the difficulties of caring for a loved one with the disease, according to the survey of Marist Institute for Public Opinion. According to Jeff Huber, president and chief operating officer of Home Instead, Inc. “The survey confirmed what our franchise owners had been hearing from their clients and their families – the majority of Americans feel unprepared to care for a loved one diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. The need for support and education for these families is critical.”  Additional survey highlights include:  • Nearly two-thirds of Americans (63 percent) have had a personal experience with someone with Alzheimer’s and/or a serious memory loss problem.  • 61 percent of Americans feel unprepared to care for a loved one diagnosed with the disease.  • If diagnosed with the disease, Americans most fear the inability to care for oneself, and burdening   others (68 percent); followed by losing memory of life and loved ones (32 percent).  • A plurality of Americans – 44 percent – cites the illness as their most feared disease compared to 33 percent who cite cancer.  • More than other generations, a majority of Americans over 65 years of age (the silent/greatest generation) – 56 percent – fear an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.  • When asked if it would be harder to receive an Alzheimer’s diagnosis or care for someone with the disease, Americans are equally split down the middle, 50/50.

t5_2rzjk,Cap10Chaos,1365837607,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28technothriller_series%29  Daemon  Soon after the death of Matthew A. Sobol from brain cancer, a computer daemon is activated. Its first mission: to kill anyone and anything that stands in its way. Detective Peter Sebeck is called in to investigate the death of two programmers who worked for a computer game manufacturer, CyberStorm Entertainment.  During his investigation, Peter meets and befriends Jon Ross who is a technology consultant. Unfortunately, their traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon program. The Daemon anticipates every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere with its operation.  The program takes over thousands of companies and provides financial and computing resources for creating AutoM8s (computer controlled driverless cars, used as transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and other devices. Freedom™  The sequel picks up shortly after the end of Daemon. Sobol's distributed AI has already infiltrated the computer systems of companies and many governments. While the Daemon is a technological creation, much of the work is carried out by human beings - eagerly doing their part to change the world according to the vision of Matthew Sobol. Connected by the ""Darknet"", these human followers create their own ranking system and economy. Meanwhile, the American political and economic system is collapsing, with the price of fuel and the unemployment rates both skyrocketing, and steady reports of violent drug gangs crossing the border from Mexico. In battling the Daemon, the government is forced into a difficult alliance with private corporations, giving rise to many private armies, some of whom are actually responsible for the attacks. The government is unaware that some corporate interests actually want the Daemon to survive - at least to use it selectively as a weapon against their rivals.  Detective Sebeck, meanwhile, is sent on a ""quest"" by the avatar of the late Matthew Sobol, one in which he will have to determine the role of freedom to the human race.  ",™
t5_2cneq,snowball_in_hell,1365837937,"Discourse means you listen to what the other side has to say, investigate their claims, and offer a reasoned rebuttal.    The anti-gunner ""discourse"" consists of throwing up a bunch of strawmen, making emotionally-charged claims, and wishful thinking about the likelyhood of ""MORE LAWS"" succeeding where prior laws have not.   The current gun control dust-up is not about ""crime"" or ""violence"", **it is about control** by an ever-increasingly intrusive government.    History is on my side, and google is my holy oracle:  ♦In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1928, Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, approximately 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1935, China established gun control. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents were unable to defend themselves and were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1956, Cambodia established gun control. From 1975 to1977, one million ""educated"" people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1964, Guatemala established gun control. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  ♦In 1970, Uganda established gun control. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  That places total victims who lost their lives — because they were unable to defend their liberty — at approximately 56 million in just the 20th century.  ""It'll never happen here!"" you sputter, ""we're a civilized democracy"".  (Please return to the holy oracle and type in ""[Patriot Act](http://www.aclu.org/free-speech-national-security-technology-and-liberty/reform-patriot-act-myths-realities)"" before you drink that Kool Aid.)

t5_2qhm7,4fthawaiian,1365845459,I got a huge rush of nostalgia seeing this. Thanks so much for posting 😊,😊
t5_2qh6p,SithisTheDreadFather,1365847240,"You're forgetting about the police.  I have utter respect for law enforcement. But I want each and every police officer that talks to me terrified that I might, at any moment, shoot them dead. Why? Because they get to carry a gun around and shoot me dead if I start ""acting violent"" and I want them terrified that if they open fire on me for no reason (they likely won't) then I can dish it right back. Or at least, I want them concerned that that might be a possibility. Would you risk shooting and missing someone if they could immediately turn around and kill you? I wouldn't and I seriously doubt that any sane person would either. I don't want the police to use any more force than necessary or to even *think* about using more force than necessary without considering their own life.  I don't want some future politician to be able to order law enforcement to detain me or my family for whatever non-reason without the police seriously concerned that they might all be shot and killed while carrying out orders. The motivation to stay alive can deter people from doing stupid things including busting down a door with an AR-15 on the other side of it.  Also, remember that the Gestapo and the KGB were not military forces, but police forces. Who was more feared by the citizenry? The Red Army or The KGB? I'm not concerned about the military. The government has nothing to gain by nuking it's own citizens, and if that happens, there's fuck all I could do about it anyways.  President Obama **almost certainly** will not order the military or the police to start attacking citizens if these gun control measures are passed. But that doesn't mean he won't kick the ball rolling downhill for President 50 to start detaining dissenting citizens.   I don't want to be under a government where I am completely powerless. The second amendment guarantees that right. ""... the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, **shall not be infringed**."" As far as I'm concerned, limiting any access to firearms is infringing on our right to keep and [bear arms](http://www.dailyrebecca.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bustedtees.2d2b9839d17e3fb6fc859da14507a709.gif).  At the end of the day, I want to be able to buy a cool looking rifle and shoot shit with it. Just because one fucking guy used it to kill someone doesn't mean they should all be outlawed. Hundreds of thousands of people own and shoot AR-15's. One guy **stole** a rifle and killed some children and suddenly all law-abiding citizens must surrender theirs. Hundreds of thousands (possibly millions) that have not killed someone.  And then there's the whole argument that criminals don't follow the law anyway, so why would they follow more laws, but ya know. I mean, Sandy Hook was a Gun Free Zone™! How could a shooting possibly happen in a Gun Free Zone™? There are no guns allowed; didn't he read the sign? Yet somehow, magically, 26 kids died by a gun in a Gun Free Zone™. Those laws really worked hard to keep kids safe, huh? You know, they didn't so we should add more laws. Yeah! That'll work!",™

The [Paleo](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/) diet is like keto but more relaxed. Its great to transition to this once you have reached your goal with keto. I'm not too sure about the different types of creatine but I know Kre-Alkalyn which I am on is a pH balanced creatine. Here's an exert from a [website](http://exerciseandsportnutritionlab.com/krealkalynvscreatinemonohydrate)   *Creatine monohydrate (CrM) has been repeatedly shown to be a safe and effective form of creatine to use in dietary supplements. However, a number of new creatine formulations have been purported to be more efficacious and/or safer forms of creatine. Kre-Alkayn® (KA, All American Pharmaceutical, Billings, MT, USA) is a pH balanced form of creatine that is purported to promote greater creatine retention because it would theoretically reduce conversion to creatinine during the digestion process, decrease the need to ingest high doses of creatine to promote muscle creatine retention, and therefore have less side effects.*",®

t5_2r8ot,sketerpot,1365889908,"2.x, I presume? What was the type of the string? You may have been sending, say, a UTF-8 `str` instead of a `unicode` string. Python tries to convert this to a `unicode` object, but its default encoding is ASCII, which can't handle the multibyte-character start bytes in UTF-8.  So, for example, this may cause problems:      unicode(""☃"")  ... but this would work fine:      unicode(u""☃"")  Also, in the future, please tell the version of Python you're using, and try to post code for a minimal case that reproduces the error.

t5_2rc19,FighterOfFoo,1365912200,"It's all about Hawke in DA2. I *adore* humorous female Hawke. That voice. ♥  But Varric is cool, and Aveline has a nice story arc. Isabela's awesome, especially if you romance her. There's loads of inter-character dialogue, too. They'll speak to each other as you walk around, much like the elevator rides in ME1, only more often, as they'll trigger on certain sections of the map. Sometimes the entire party will have a conversation, and they're mostly quite funny, especially anything involving Isabela, the slattern.  The high points of that game, I found, were the DLC. Legacy is steeped in lore and Mark of the Assassin will probably lead in well to DA3. But there's some good humour in the dialogue, too.  I'd suggest giving DA2 another chance (I'm not sure if how much you've played of it), but definitely try DA:O. It's a bit off-putting going from ME and DA2 to DA:O and having an unvoiced protagonist, but once you get into it properly, it shouldn't bother you.",♥

Put a link to an email address somewhere at the bottom or make a contact me page. You never know when random work is going to show its head. Even if you are not interested in doing it as a living sometimes that spare cash is nice.  4. On the collections page I would suggest having the images work well together. When the title of a collection is as long as ""Orlando Calling Day 1"" and the image related to it is the same spacing size as the word ""Orlando"" you fill the screen up with a lot of white space and words which takes away from why people are on the site, your photography.  5. As someone stated less is more. Show your best top of the line photos those 1 in 10,000 shots because that is what you want people to see and employee you by. If you show everything you don't know what image will be the last the person looking at your work leaves your site with. If they see an ok image vs a great image remember they will compare that to the next image they see by the next photographer.

t5_2qhk3,Imnotmrabut,1365932905,"There is very revealing history concerning Rape in the USA and how it is presented by [W.A.S.P. feminists](http://www.flickr.com/photos/imnotmrabut/8347662664/) and how so many have dismissed the history to deny that prison rape exists ... or that men can even have a positive view of or role in addressing rape.  Rape has been made into a commodity to be traded and used - and marketed as an exclusively female market. It has been made into a tool and psychological Goad to bully and force people to react in certain emotional ways.   The term [Rape Culture](http://goo.gl/oTdhb) is the name of the 1974/5 film produced by Oscar winning Film makers Margaret Lazarus - Renner Wunderlich.   Many Supposed feminists do NOT want that simple fact recognised by the world as it destroys all of the false reality constructed over that last 40 or so years. It's shocking how many Gender Studies students will waffle on about Rape Culture but don'r even know basic history - it's not presented to them and that is [Milieu Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_control) - or as many others call it Brain washing and Cult Indoctrination.   There is no earlier known usage of The Term Rape Culture , even Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Sociology states -   &gt;""*Rape culture is a concept of unknown origin and of uncertain definition; yet it has made its way into everyday vocabulary and is assumed to be commonly understood.* **The award-winning documentary film Rape Culture made by Margaret Lazarus in 1975 takes credit for first defining the concept.**"" [Source](http://webcitation.org/6D7ujMZBN)*  The Film was inspired by and featured the work of two groups founded by Black African Americans. The first was ""Prisoners Against Rape inc"" - a not for profit set up (1972) by Prisoners at Lorton Reformatory Virgina and addressing the issues of rape both inside and outside of prison. They were supported by many.  The leader of Prisoners Against Rape (William Fuller)  is even [on record as giving evidence to Congress on rape back in the 1980's](http://goo.gl/s4ees) - and one wonders at the further 20 years delay in addressing prison rape and setting up the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003?   in 1972/3 Prisoners Against Rape started working with the DC Rape Criss Centre through Loretta Ross, Yulanda Ward and Nkenge Toure. The DC Rape Crisis centre was the first such centre in the USA and set up by Black African American women to address the needs of Black African American women and men.  Then when it came to making a film a whole load of white ladies wanted in on camera - Loretta Ross has described a great deal of the behaviour she witnessed as Cynical. She was even amused as how supposedly white lesbian feminist suddenly became straight ladies in the presence on Black male prisoners.   From there it was all down hill - men were pushed out of the Picture Literally, Black women also were made to magically vanish and rape was made into a political tool to advantage women and control men.  I have found feminism to be opportunistic, abusive and cynical in its exploitation of others. It uses racism, Disability Discrimination, Sexism and promotion of Human Rights Abuse to meet it's own ends - the ends justify the means.   It's a bigger and more dangerous cult than Scientology! Who would think that White Chicks could be so manipulative devious and nasty?   Some further Reading:  ""[Dear Prof Fuckwit, Try “Google For Dummies”! ..I am told Rape Culture, the film, is a fiction, because Some folks had not heard of it until I mentioned it via some web sites.](http://imnotamensrightsactivistbut.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/dear-prof-fuckwit-try-google-for-dummies-any-idea-why-the-evidence-is-missing/#)""  [Oh, I’ve forgotten to tell you about Prisoners Against Rape. - *ROSS: And then — oh, I’ve forgotten to tell you about Prisoners Against Rape.

Not only that, but if someone JUST wants a dog to love, there are millions of mixed breeds at the local ""pound"" or Humane Society, ASPCA (what have you), that, despite being in perfect ""purebred"" health, will be put down if someone decides they want a purebred just for it's own sake, even though there's no other difference between the two dogs.  If THAT'S reason enough to stop someone from saving an animal's life, then I firmly believe that's wrong.  If their lives weren't at stake (&amp;of course their health &amp; happiness matter as well), I would have no problem other than my first point in this post (about personal treatment of ones pet).

I do find in particular with students if they are either Unwilling to accept reality or having issues with reality - they get asked what is their view of Academic Fraud and how does it apply to the place they are studying. Most define it to include lecturers deliberately pushing and agenda and withholding facts for personal propaganda reasons.   I also ask about the Falsification of History and if they would deny the existence of the KKK, Hitler or even Mother Teresa? Then they get asked why they are willing to deny the lives of Black African American male prisoners dealing with prison rape - and being supported by Black African American Women who founded the first Rape Criss Centre?   It's funny how them denying post-feminists turn on the sisterhood when they are faced with reality of either racists cover-up and collusion with fraud - or believing reality! It tends to work on those who are at the Pigattian Developmental Psychology Preoperational stage: - ""Egocentrism begins strongly and then weakens. Children cannot conserve or use logical thinking.""  When you weaken the ego and oblige them to use reason and converse in a structured manor they can progress. Normally this stage of development is only seen between the ages of 2 and 7. Some just seem to be very late developers and they need a Structured learning environment to achieve even basic proficiency.   ",™

t5_2qhon,vonDread,1365952020,"I've played Heroes Unlimited in the past, which is the same system as Rifts.  Sorry, Rifts®.  If you know anything about Rifts®, you know how broken that system is.  Started M&amp;M with 1E, and I've been playing M&amp;M2E since it came out.  Haven't tried 3E yet, but I honestly don't know if I want to.  I've found amazing builds for all the major DC (and Marvel) characters, so I don't need DC's official game that uses the M&amp;M3E rules.  Once I find a system I like, I *never* see a need to upgrade to something else.  And I'm usually the DM (GM, whatever), so the choice of system is usually up to me.  I can do *everything* I want to do with M&amp;M2E, and the rules are fairly close to D&amp;D 3.5, the RPG system I know the best, so I've stuck with it.  And you're right about character building.  It can get completely nuts if you're not there, building the character with them every step of the way.  But I love that every player gets the same amount of points to buy *everything*, so it's pretty even and balanced.  Unless you've got a power-gaming min/maxer in the group.  Luckily, I currently don't.  But I've had to deal with that on occasion in M&amp;M.  Nothing ruins a DM's plans faster than a player who knows how to exploit the system.",®

t5_2rfz5,NigmaNoname,1365955523,"It depends how he dies.  I don't see why so many people are adverse to characters dying. Killing off a character can be a very positive thing from a writing point of view. I nearly threw a party when Ace died because it meant that Oda wrote an awesome and unpredictable Arc with real consequences. I mean, sure, One Piece is a Shōnen Manga which typically means predictable plot and nobody dies except in flashbacks™ is the norm, but I like to give Oda a lot more credit and have higher expectations of him because he's a great writer.  Ace dying was a huge milestone for One Piece because now we can't be sure who might die. Dying opened up as a *possibility*. Before Ace, most people were convinced that nobody ever dies- that meant that a lot of the situations that were supposed to be tense simply weren't. If you know nobody can die then where's the suspense? What's the worst that could happen? It makes you care about the plot less because the worst case scenario is not interesting or scary. This is the same reason I really loved the Sabaody Archipelago arc where Kuma completely trashed the crew and Luffy basically had his own adventure for a long time- because it showed us that Oda isn't afraid to break the crew dynamic, have them all be spread apart, etc. It really, really took me by surprise- I didn't think he'd go through with it, because it was really risky to simply remove so many vital characters from the story for a really really long time- I think Impel Down/Marineford was some of the ballsiest and awesome arcs ever.  If Luffy or Usopp died at the end, it would sure as hell make the ending more epic. Maybe it's because I'm more interested in seeing an epic story rather than seeing my favorite characters live, but I wouldn't mind tossing one into the fire to have an epic, emotional, intense and incredible ending. Of course, that isn't to say that killing a character will always be meaningful- you obviously have to make it meaningful else that's also just bad writing. Ace's death had a huuuuuge buildup, and had a lot of symbolic meaning attached to it, so in other words it was executed very well.  I'm not saying someone *has* to die at the end to make the ending better, but it definitely wouldn't hurt if it happened in a meaningful way. I mean, One Piece started with the greatest pirate of all time dying, it doesn't seem completely unlikely that another one would die at the end... The whole ""will of D"" thing and the way history in One Piece seems to like to repeat itself definitely suggest it's a possibility.",™

All this stuff is fiction. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0123R6vjIoE#t=2m09s  More to the point, Mormonism is far less 'Christian' the Christianity is Jewish.  They didn't just add 'another whole gospel'. They added several gospels and a crap load of new stuff.  They're polytheists. The universe is filled with gods. Their god is just one of an huge number of gods. He's got a holy harem of sister wives, girl gods who are literally his sister. They're all the literal childern of his daddy god and daddy's harem.

t5_2qhc8,Nemlet,1365961982,"Upvote for asking an important question.   I'll be speaking from experience here.   In the past three years, myself, as well as two of my hunting buddies have purchased four Remington firearms for hunting. These firearms were as follows: Three Remington 870 Expresses and one 887 Nitromag Waterfowl.   All of these guns have had the exact. same. problems. (except for the exterior of the 887.... it can't really rust.)  They're all rust machines. If you don't take these guns out of the safe at least twice a week and clean them, they'll have rust forming on them ***EVERYWHERE***. In the barrels, in the action, even in the magazine tube.   With our completely stock 870s, you'll be lucky to get 6 shots off without a jam of some kind.   My best so far is 41 shots without a jam. This is for every kind of ammo we feed them, too. Steel rimmed WWB, brass rimmed Remington game loads, Steel and brass rimmed buckshot of all sizes and manufacturers. Even Lightfield Sabot slugs jam these guns.  Now onto the 887. This gun wasn't terribly expensive, but it was a complete waste of money and time. They talk this firearm up on their website as if it is the shotgun to end all shotguns. It is the second worst shotgun I've ever had the misfortune of handling, with the exception of the Remington 870 Express.   Here's what their website says about the 887:   ""Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary new SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. That means enhanced confidence on the first shot and smoother, faster follow-ups.  ***Because the Model 887 Nitro Mag’s design is inspired by the strength and dependability of our Model 870, you can count on it to cycle flawlessly and stand up to abuse like no other.""***  This statement really stands out to me for some reason...    All in all, I would never recommend a Remington firearm to anybody again. I might even go so far as to say that good friends don't let other friends buy Remington firearms.   EDIT: These firearms were purchased over the past three years, not four years.  ",™

Concerns about potential damage from unforeseen consequences of GMO food production are far more complex than ""a variant of the naturalistic fallacy that implies that since it's 'artificial' it may be dangerous."" (Not to say that this couldn't be part of the concern for some people...).   Check out this article if you're interested in reading a bit more about why many people are ambivalent about GMOs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1083956/  This is not directed at you personally, but in general many skeptics that I've met and encountered in this forum seem to make extremely uncharitable assumptions about people who feel that current policy and practices aren't in the best interest of the public.

t5_2r65t,g2x222,1365974860,"I'd recommend first getting a suit and dress shirt that fit well, a pair of black oxfords, and a tie or two. Unless you *really* like watches, nix the watch and apply that to your clothes budget.   * [**Suit (sidebar guide)**](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/e96hr/psa_guide_to_suits/) - While I'd love to tell you to go with a made-to-measure service, you'd have to skimp on everything else. Jos A Bank makes decent quality suits for the (sale) price. Go with navy or dark grey, and [make sure it fits properly](http://redd.it/ehrtv). Pick something up as soon as you can so you can bring it to a tailor and get any adjustments made (sleeves, waist, etc) to get the fit closer to 100%. Just in case you want to go made-to-measure, check out [Thick as Thieves](http://thickasthievesla.com) and go with the traditional cut (one of many MTM options). * **Dress shirt** - I personally like Brooks Brothers. They have a few different fits (Traditional - Extra Slim, I  feel that Slim fits me best) and a variety of styles. [This is what I like](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Supima®-Cotton-Non-Iron-Slim-Fit-Ainsley-Collar-Dress-Shirt/116Q,default,pd.html?dwvar_116Q_Color=WHIT&amp;contentpos=1). I'd recommend going into the store so they can measure you and have you try on a few different fit shirts. * **Dress shoes** - [This is the style you want to go for](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF270_1_40000000001_-1). Check out your local DSW, Zappos, etc, and find something in that style. Make sure you have a matching black belt. If you see yourself wearing a suit and black shoes regularly for your job, you might want to consider picking up the Allen Edmond's.  * **Tie** - This really comes down to personal preference. For an interview, keep it simple and conservative. Colors like dark red tend to work well.  As for business casual wear... into what industry are you going? And at what kind of positions are you looking? Typically, business casual means chinos for pants; polos, button-up shirts, and sweaters on top, and leather shoes (and jeans if the workplace observes a casual Friday).  *However*, the category ""business casual"" has a huge range. I used to work at a major high-tech company doing engineering work, and people typically dressed more casual than business (e.g., shorts, jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers were really common, in addition to what I listed above).  I'd recommend picking up a couple staple items, and you can fill in the rest once you get a feel for your job -  * Slim, straight, Khaki chinos. Dockers seem to be an MFA favorite, but I like [the Gavin-fit from Banana Republic](http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=763621&amp;locale=en_US&amp;kwid=1&amp;sem=false&amp;sdReferer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CDUQFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.bananarepublic.com%252Fproducts%252Fgavin-fit-straight-chino-P763621.jsp%26ei%3DNxlrUeSeLYa49QTGhoDgCQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNFzGLh7xgY_lQyh86ewHfnvtDou-Q%26sig2%3DjTuW7E1sPstnfrWMqZTBMw%26bvm%3Dbv.45175338%2Cd.eWU).  * A couple of Oxford cloth shirts. I got a couple of [these from Brooks Brothers] recently, and I love 'em. Brooks Brothers does 3 for $225, so you can get these along with the aforementioned dress shirt (or some other combination) and save a little bit. If you want to wear the shirt untucked, you can get it hemmed. * A polo or two. [Many options (sidebar guide)](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17i88u/polo_guide_v2/). * Brown leather shoes. This also depends on your workplace and budget. [More casual](http://www.quoddy.com/blucher/) or [more formal](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF6105_1_40000000001_-1). Again, these are both well-made options that are made-in-the-USA that may or may not fit your budget. Personally, I don't mind investing in something I'll enjoy and use often. Again, get a belt in a similar shade to match.  As for the watch, I don't think it's necessary, but it's a personal preference. I don't wear a watch because it rubs against the desk/keyboard/computer when I type, and I'd rather not wear one than have to take it off.  Anyways, I hope this was useful. I didn't consider your budget when I picked items and instead chose the styles you should be looking for. However, if you get a pair of dress shoes under $100 and find some items on sale, you should come in close based on what I listed.  Good luck with the job search!  edit: While kkfl gives solid advice, I wouldn't get more than one suit (or go overboard with any of these items) until you get a better feel for your job.",®

The Bible isn't even meant to be God's Instructions for the Church, as though Jesus should have had something to say about that.  &gt;Jesus himself is God's Word. Jesus himself is God's revelation to humanity. Jesus himself is the most important thing God has given to humanity.  &gt;Jesus gathered disciples and began a gathering of followers, a Church.

That some of his followers and their followers wrote about Jesus and the Church of their day is a wonderful (and frankly surprising, when compared to the other Apostles) gift, which God has chosen to use in a very special way.""  Christianity does not worship a book. If it did it would not be called ""*Christ*ianity"".  As for ""Don't be worldly,"" he meant that we should not be of the societal world (a.k.a. involving ourselves in sin just to fit in).",™

So no, it's not better, it's wrong. I don't really care that you're a virgin. I care that you don't wrongfully take advantage of someone in your efforts to rid yourself of your 'V-Card'.  So not disclosing the fact that your a virgin is the same as rape. LOL.   &gt;[–]♀tunamuffin 4 points 2 hours ago Exactly. I am not just turning down virgins because I'm a bitch and I can, I'm turning them down because I will likely really hurt them. Not intentionally, but I'm honestly not looking for anything serious. And I really don't want that sort of pressure. Sure, maybe you'll be cool with a casual relationship as a virgin, but personal experience tells me you won't and I'm just trying to make reasonable choices that are most likely to benefit both of us.  More rationalization.    &gt;[–]♀lalimalina 1 point 2 hours ago I know that you can't help the way you feel. If you feel personally rejected, that's how you feel, and you're entitled to your emotions. You just need to realize that your feelings do not reflect reality. And if you're not willing to try again after rejection... that sucks, but it's your decision. You'd only be hurting yourself. Having sex with someone without disclosing your virginity is absolutely having sex under false pretenses. After a certain (fuzzy) age, it is generally assumed that people are sexually experienced. Just like if you meet a woman and go back to her place for some wild crazy sex, it would be generally assumed that she has the body of a woman. But no, you're nailing her nailing her from behind and oh, whoops, out pops her penis! But she never told you she had a vagina, you just assumed... See the problem? The fact is, having sex with you is not going to be like having sex with someone experienced. The woman you sleep with has a right to decide for herself if she's up for it or not. Think of it in terms of informed consent vs consent. When you do get around to actively trying, the way you go about things is going to have a huge impact on whether or not you succeed. If you act bumbling and nervous and treat your virginity like it's a big deal or get upset when people think twice about it rather than glossing it over, it's going to be a big deal. If you're casual and adult about it and take things in stride, it might be an issue for some people but for someone else it's going to be no big thing.",♀

t5_2fwo,kamatsu,1365984068,"&gt; we can actually return multiple values from a function, not just tuples. And thanks to row polymorphism, we have a uniform way to compose functions of different types, so the flow of data in our programs doesn’t get obscured, as it were, by the plumbing.  There is no semantic difference between the two. It's easy to write exactly the same row-polymorphic program in Haskell and you end up with code that looks almost identical, with spaces replaced with the `(.)` operator.  &gt; This is impossible to do with any other type of language. With concatenative programming, a parallel compiler is a plain old map-reduce!  He's quite wrong about this. For starters, usually we want data parallelism, which this does not provide at all (the composition of functions is not an expensive operation). Secondly, it's not difficult to rewrite an applicative program into concatenative form, and vice versa, so there's no benefit gained from concatenative languages in terms of parallelism or compiler implementation (these days anyway).  &gt; It is considered good functional programming style to write functions in point-free form, omitting the unnecessary mention of variables (points) on which the function operates. For example, “f x y = x + y” can be written as “f = (+)”.  &gt; point-free style is generally considered a Good Thing™.  No functional programmer really believes that. Even in Haskell, which uses pointfree style a lot more than some other FP languages, it's good for some things, and really, really bad at a lot of others.   &gt; No matter what, you need different combinators to compose functions of different types, because Haskell doesn’t have row polymorphism for function arguments, and it inherently can’t.  This is not true. Implement your primitives with simple row-polymorphic types like (for filter) `(a -&gt; Bool,([a],b)) -&gt; ([a],b)` and it's trivial to write ""concatenative"" programs in haskell.  See [this very simple example](https://github.com/leonidas/codeblog/blob/master/2012/2012-02-17-concatenative-haskell.md).  His ""quotations"" are just first class functions, which exist even in Java.  &gt; . To do so exposes all of the underlying complexity of the expression that we’re accustomed to deferring to a compiler. Factor gets around this by introducing a facility for lexically scoped local variables.   Ah, so to solve the problems with concatenative programming, you simply don't use it.        ",™

t5_2sc5r,fakenamefakenumber,1365987397," Wow this got pretty lengthy, so heres a Pre-post summary:  **I seek out my happiness because without happiness I quickly become unhappy. I have no neutral state that I can remember. While there is no philosophical reason to prefer one state to the other, it appears that there is a physical one and as such I follow it and dedicate most of my energy to self-amusement. I don’t know why any one thing in particular makes me happy but I’ve come up with a list of things that do and do not and I try to live with them in mind.**   Perhaps I should rephrase my statement somewhat. While the philosophy I cognitively believe in states that everything is meaningless, as a physical human being there seems to be an underlying imperative to survive and avoid discomfort. As it is easier to follow this imperative than to try and go against it, I follow it even though I ascribe it no actual logical meaning. Sort of a “path of least resistance” play I guess.  No, breathing doesn’t make me happy but it allows me to live which allows me to do things that make me happy. I can’t say that I am always happy but I can say that I am never neutral. This may seem strange but if I am not doing something that makes me happy (not necessarily ecstatic, merely above a neutral feeling) I very quickly become intolerably depressed or antsy.    Logically, suicide then becomes a good option (hypothetically, don’t worry I’m fine ☺) because I end up without any feelings positive or negative in nature, a sort of risk avoidance protocol. I don’t commit suicide though because again that innate physical imperative to live comes up and makes me consider other non-life ending ways to avoid the feeling. In my case, from a young age I’ve adapted to almost consistently be doing new things that keep me engaged and stop the negative feelings (I try to always have a new book, a puzzle, and my smartphone on me plus I will strike up random conversations with people, anything to avoid the intense and intolerant feeling of boredom, plus I end up learning a ton of stuff)    I feel as if I don’t so much know that I am happy in a positive sense, but I recognize that I have lost the gnawing feeling that generally occurs when I am not doing things that make me happy and that in and of itself feels positive.   Perhaps if I had more familiarity with a neutral feeling this need for happiness would dissipate but as I haven’t really experienced anything but “happy” and “very unhappy” I can’t comment. I can however say that when I am in my “happy” mood, which is the vast majority of the time, I don’t come across the same as others around me when they claim to be “happy”. I can easily mimic their displays (smiling/laughing, increased physical contact, open body posture etc) but I sincerely can’t recall any moment in my life where something in my normal day-to-day life has made me naturally act this way. My “happy” is almost indistinguishable from other peoples “normal” It’s entirely possible they are faking it as much as I, but they assure me otherwise. In fact, I only act in the way that others seem to understand as happy with the most stimulating events, for example fighting, cliff diving, sex (depending on the partner)  **To answer your question as specifically as possible, things that make me happy (which seems equivalent to “normal” in most others) include:**   Self-improvement (learning new things, gaining new skills, generally increasing my competence in getting what I want)  Videogames (especially RPGs)  Exercise  Good food  Good conversation/intelligent debate  A good book   **Things that I’ve noticed spike me above my “happy” state and as such I try to do as much as possible:**  Novel experiences, especially things that pump up my adrenaline (I love rock climbing, driving quickly, fighting in tournaments)  My job (I work in the medical field)  Sex	  Fireworks   **Things that don’t make me happy that seem to make others happy include:**  Spending time doing nothing in the presence of friends (“chilling”)  Family  Charity Work   ---I can and have enjoyed these things in the past, however I don’t enjoy them specifically so much as I sometimes get satisfaction from the fact that in doing them I know that I’m getting people to trust me more which is a useful thing.--- ",☺

t5_2s9nt,Neverdied,1366007290,"IANAL but this is called derivative work and is legal and you do not need a license for it. It is part of Fair Use...as long as you are not selling them commercially ie thousands of those in packaging. What you are making is an art piece based on some © material, but the art piece itself is not a copy. Also since you are not a commercial entity that is also ok.  For example if you wanted to sell Mario posters commercially you would need a license. But since you are making what is called ""derivative work"" you are ok under the © law as long as your creation is new and original. Beads art is obviously not what Nintendo is doing and thus is covered under derivative work.  What these conventions want to make sure is that you are not for example taking the first Spiderman commic book and making a scan of it and selling 100s of it. That is © infringement. Making new art based on previous art is ok. Just like what Roy lichtenstein was doing, taking comic book cells and making them in large paintings with his style.  Of course there are example of artists that have been sued and lost due to not having enough money to defend themselves but in essence as long as your art material (beads) is original there is really nothing that you should be worried about imo",©

Your ninja edit:  &gt; Further comments expand on uncomfortability with OP actively seeking out really young women in his mid* 20s, and distinguish that from a romance that happens to bloom with an incidental age gap.  What you originally said:  &gt; I've only heard the 18/30 double standard as you'be described brought up by men. While I imagine it's happened, I can't recall a time when a female feminist brought it up as such.  These are clear examples of the old/young double standard being brought up by women. They do not take into consideration that younger women may, gasp, actually prefer older men. They see it as some kind of predatory act: the older male bamboozling the young innocent co-ed. The older man is ""taking advantage of their immaturity"" and being ""skeezy"".  Also, as you can see by the number of upvotes, a number of women (and men, to be fair) share the same sentiments. However, as this is /r/AskWomen, we can be quite certain that the majority of the readership is female.",♀

t5_2ryq7,EltonJohnsBallbag,1366018492,"**PROS**  ♥ 15 goals in 30 games for a relegation-threatened side devoid of any real creative force. With only the (admittedly promising) Andy Weimann ever playing alongside him for support  ♥ Can create goals out of nothing. See, for example, any of his strikes against Liverpool this season.  ♥ Excellent hold-up play. The man is a fucking tank, and has that magnet-like quality to his frame, where 50/50's seem to gravitate towards him. Reminiscent of an in-form Heskey (don't laugh) or even Drogba (IN THIS ONE CATEGORY. RELAX). The same goes for attacking headers and aerial presence going forwards.  ♥ Is young. Now I hate how some people completely overstate the importance of youth here, but it does have its merits. He has time to grow on an intellectual level, and he is not too stuck in his ways to adapt to a new system/team/environment. Will hopefully still have the desire and drive that youth brings.  ♥ Will, most likely, be relatively cheap. The fact is, he's not a huge name playing for a glamourous team in an exotic league (e.g. Falcao, Damião) so will naturally not have as overinflated a price (fingers crossed).  ♥ Would fit Spurs' system nicely. Whilst Villa are in the shit, they do play some nice attacking football (it's not Benteke's fault they can't defend). He's perfect for long-ball hold-up play, tiki-taka involvement with the more creative midfielders, and can be a presence when tracking back due to his size and relative speed. He doesn't need another striker alongside him and if he's getting this many goals with Weimann as trequartista then imagine what Bale would do to his game.  **CONS**  卐 Is relatively unproven. Yes, it's true, one great season in the PL does not a world-beater make. It has big potential to backfire.  卐 He could cost us. I know I argued the other way on this point before, but it's true. On this here other hand, we could be held to ransom as young players who do well in the PL can be costly (see Andy Carroll, Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing. Hah, Liverpool).  卐 I...I'm all out on this one. Sorry. I've attempted an objective view for us all here, but due to the great season he's had and the stark contrast he provides to his shitbag teammates I just don't think I can say anything else against him. I was skeptical before, but he's won me over with his sheer consistency. I would like this signing to happen.  EDIT: 卐 Poor pass completion rate, as veridical kindly pointed out. Whether this is down to the quality of the balls played to him/the movement and ability of teammates around him remains to be seen. Certainly an interesting concern though. ",♥

t5_2qnan,Forgery,1366044064,We converted from iSCSI to NFS on our NetApp.  One advantage is that NFS offers per-file IO (compared to per-LUN IO for iSCSI).  This means that you can have one big volume with all of your VMs and you don't suffer a performance hit due to IO queues.  Combine this with NetApp's per-volume deduplication and you can see some real space savings.  Check out NetApp's Whitepaper that compares protocols:  [Performance Report: Multiprotocol Performance Test of VMware® ESX 3.5 on NetApp Storage Systems](http://media.netapp.com/documents/tr-3697.pdf)  Note that one big disadvantage of NFS is that there is no multipathing.  ,®

These games broke open a genre before anyone really knew how to powergame, before internet strategies took off and before people had an idea of what they ""should"" be doing in an MMO. An era before the linear MMO.  It's hard for me to get excited about an MMO any longer. The things I loved about early generation MMOs are just not available any longer. Things like skill based progression, non-linear progression, deep crafting economies and the social aspect of small groups. Today's MMOs are all about forced instanced PVP, no drop-no repair items for life from raids, linear progression and forced exploration (if any).  I'm looking forward to /r/camelotunchained. I'm a backer, and am hoping that this project will at least satiate my want for crafting, tri-realm RVR, small group combat and personal interactions. The last few MMOs that I have played that I have truly enjoyed have been Vanguard and DDO, and then it dates back to the UO, DaoC and AC days.  There can never been another first kiss in the MMO genre. It's well explored. It's nothing new. ",™

t5_2sokd,Abe_Vigoda,1366055845,"""It's not real"".  Most people can mentally justify violence in media because it's usually not real and in the back of your mind, your brain is telling you that the images on the screen are just squibs or cgi or latex and special effects.  Counter that to beauty, which people don't recognize as much for being fake. We know violence isn't real. Beauty on the other hand is something that the media makes feel real because it perpetuates their goals which is to encourage shopping and advertising.  They don't show real violence on tv anymore because real violence isn't 'fun'. They claim it's to protect the children. All it's doing is keeping children ignorant, dehumanized, entertained.  In the 70's, the US had to give up on Vietnam because people were getting real news about real people who were really getting killed.  Reporters could report about the true harshness of war complete with images of napalm covered children, or shell shocked soldiers getting hooked on heroin as a way to combat their PTSD.  The military lost because the antiwar resistance got strong and the military lost the will of the people.  When the US invaded Grenada, they banned the press and used military personal as field reporters. The trouble though, is they got busted lying and had to let the press back in.  When the US invaded Iraq in 91, they knew they had to control the press to avoid another Vietnam, so they used embedded journalists.  These were real reporters for the major networks assigned to ground troops. The problem with that however, is that stories wer heavily censored and proofed first to give the military a more positive image.  If you wrote a negative story, they'd kick you off the front lines, and you'd spend the rest of the war covering it from the hotel bar.  The media never complained. They went along with it becaue by this time, there was cable tv and the networks were getting great ratings.  CNN turned the war into a sporting event. They were criticized for sensationaling it but like they give a damn. It's more money for them.  They sanitized their coverage and didn't really portray the event unbiased or from a neutral point. They just pumped out the flashy graphics, showed lots of big explosions and brought soldiers out to say hi to their folks back home.  Following 911, when the US invaded Afghanistan then Iraq, the coverage switched again when Geraldo Rivera drew a map in the sand. The military deemed it national security and kicked out all the embedded journalists.  Instead of having reporters in the field, the networks brought in military spokespeople and 'expert' talking heads who relayed events rather than showed them. They'd narrate the situation while the networks would flash gratuitous stock footage of big guns being fired, jets taking off, big explosions, and it's more like a commercial for war than actual coverage of real events.  When the military banned photos of troop caskets, that was purely to avoid a negative image being laced into their perception of war™.  They don't show stuff [like this](http://youtu.be/igpU90aXsJs) because it's way too real and sobering and people wouldn't stand for it.  In movies, they always have to have the good guy have a reason to shoot the bad guy. Han shot first. The entire argument is the context. On one side, he's the good guy, and not just a cold blooded killer.  A commom cliche is the bad guy gets beaten up, then is just about to shoot the good guy in the back, who then turns around and shoots because there's a moral justification.  Call of Duty, fun game, but it's also massively dehumanizing and a great promotional tool for the gun industry who licenses virtual depictions of their weapons to improve the 'realism', as well supporting the military's propaganda lines.  There's more stuff like how violence is targeted towards males while beauty is aimed towards women predominantly. With men, we're supposed to emulate these hard ass commando badass stereotypes. They make them cool looking on purpose to rile up our blood lust and make us willing to go Chuck Norris on bad guys.  It's all psychological shaping really.",™

t5_2s8bl,OliveBranchMLP,1366059890,"You oversimplified and exaggerated my argument.  First of all, I did not say that *everyone* who dislikes DRB is self-entitled. Just the ""most misbehaved of the brony fandom"".  Second of all, I did not say that you are not allowed to dislike DRB or to feel that it did not live up to the hype. A lot of people have very good reasons for disliking it. I'm just pointing out that there are also some really *dumb* reasons for disliking it, and that a great many bronies dislike it for those dumb reasons: because it's not ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, because it fails to meet the ridiculous standard of quality set by the show, because JanAnimations or Spirit and Lion do two-minute shorts better than an entire 30 minute episode, etc.  I myself am not very fond of DRB, simply because, as you said, ""other fan works show better understanding of pacing, story, framing, comedic timing, etc."" and that tends to be the substance of what I find entertaining. But I'm not going to deny that DRB is an extraordinary technical achievement for a project of such humble origins, and deserves to be lauded on those merits as much it is criticized for its other failings. Aesthetics are as much a creative endeavor as storytelling, and to ignore the former does the entire field of animation a terrible injustice. For that reason alone, while DRB on a whole is not the Best Thing Ever™, it certainly ranks high.   ""Just pretty"" is actually a very big deal, simply because, while we have a deluge of talented writers in this fandom, we have an extreme shortage of talented animators.

t5_2qm4e,illperipheral,1366062351,"I am not a lawyer by any means, but that document says that Mr. Bowman knowingly planted seeds containing Monsanto's roundup-ready technology, and that even though Mr. Bowman did not purchase these seeds from Monsanto directly, he purposefully isolated them by spraying with Roundup and replanting the resulting surviving seeds multiple years.  From the summary (immediately before the Conclusion paragraph on the last page): &gt; Bowman  planted Roundup Ready® seeds with actual notice that  Monsanto considered this activity to infringe its patents.  Because Bowman received actual notice under § 287(a) as  of June 11, 1999, the court need not reach the issue of  constructive notice through marking. Accordingly, Monsanto may recover damages under § 287.  Or did you mean that this is another example of a patent infringement case involving Monsanto that was ruled in favour of the patent holder?  I am 100 % completely sure that Monsanto is very much aware of the negative perception the general public has of them. Do you really think that they will go around indiscriminantly suing people that legitimately did not intend to plant crops containing their patented gene? That PDF that you linked describes how Monsanto, after finding out that Mr. Bowman was re-planting the roundup-ready seed, served him with a cease-and-desist notification. Mr. Bowman thought that since he bought the seed from somewhere other than Monsanto he could legally continue to do so. This court decided that he could not, and that's why he was found liable.  edit: please excuse the tone of my reply, it seems I misread your post somewhat  &gt; my point is that this is not a black and white issue, as the strict opponents and proponents make it out to be. There are complexities and nuances, and the economic and ethical questions are not insignificant  Oh I absolutely agree, don't get me wrong. Any development in science should have its benefits carefully weighed against its risks. It's just that many of the arguments a lot of people use against genetic modification technology are complete nonsense.  There are lots of people that do have the necessary background knowledge to be able to provide useful comments on this issue. The risks of horizontal gene transfer, for example, are not nil. It's always a matter of risk assessment -- is it better to entertain the risk of producing roundup-resistant weeds or to continue to use herbicides that are both more harmful to humans and the environment? That's not a trivial question to answer.  The problem I have is when people who do not have the general scientific knowledge that would qualify them to have an *informed* opinion on the matter try to shove their ignorant personal opinions down everyone's throats. See also: Jenny McCarthy and her anti-vaccination movement; intelligent design creationists; etc. (note that I'm not including you here, don't get me wrong)",®

t5_2qh1i,eightNote,1366077079,"Has it already been two weeks since I went to the Olive Garden? Hard to believe. But the good news is that the team of gastrointestinologists monitoring my condition ‘round the clock has informed me that the meal is well on its way to being digested. So that’s cool. Hold on while I try to remember what happened that night.  What happened that night was a bunch of internet weirdos walked into a Springfield Olive Garden. The aroma of irony surrounding them nearly overpowered the garlic fumes, which are typically strong enough to make the wood veneer bubble and sproing off its plane like the table was popping a boner. Those internet guys may have strolled into that Olive Garden with recklessness in their hearts. They may have been packing a titanic thirst for self abuse. They may have been fucking idiots. But I will tell you right now, what they were NOT, was fucking POOR. I was prepared. I went to the ATM and everything. I had fifteen sawbucks burning a whole in my pocket, and there were authentic Italian slaves in that building who would see to it my money was converted into fifteen pounds of pasta burning a whole in my stomach.  We probably flashed this cash around more than would be construed as decent, if we were in a place where decency wasn’t Italian for “physically assault me in the restroom, please.” (“Decencissimo, per favore. Sì grazie!”) The wad of hard collateral weighed down the table the whole time we were there, and I made good and sure the waitress could see it up front so she knew we meant business. The waitress was trained in a dialect I think OG Corporate calls Family-CasuAffable, which primarily involves pretending that strange internet people actually belong in public, and every inscrutable in-joke they blurt out is totally hilarious. She would be rewarded heavily for her role in this charade, oh yes. Primarily through self-administered alcohol and pain medication after hours, one can only hope.  While in my wallet, the one hundred and fifty dollars had naturally sopped up much of my soul’s heady puissance, and hot rainbow lasers were rioting from the eyeballs of seven and a half psychedelic Andrew Jacksons all night long. This fierce little militia of technicolor A-Jax sitting there on the table served a real purpose, and not just to remind everybody other than me how shabby and unremarkable their souls were. It reminded us of the steep hill we had to climb that evening, to somehow burn through a buck fifty at an Olive Garden, an establishment notorious for its bargains. This is a corporation which manages to turn a PROFIT by hemorrhaging tornadoes of free bread and salad by some dark fiscal entropy yet uncharted by economists. Their shit is priced to mother fucking move, you know? And here we are toting madd-staxx, sashaying like the Rockefellers into the eye of this pitiless food geyser, derricked to the earth by salmon stuccoed drywall and stock gondola music. If someone put a gun to your head, do you think you could unload just shy of eight Andy J-Bombs at an OG on ANYTHING? And by “put a gun to your head,” I mean for the purpose of this hypothetical, and not during the ordeal one naturally expects to face when entering the OG men’s room. Yeah, we weren’t so sure we could do it either. I mean, they were already putting like five upended plastic lampshades full of breadsticks on the table before we could even crack a menu and make a battleplan for carving up this soul money. Soul money which I remind you I HAD to spend. See, there really was a guy with a gun to my head. His name was THE INTERNET.  So you’ll understand when I tell you I pored over the menu in a state of critical anguish over the rock-bottom prices, crunching figures on my iPhone calculator and swearing louder than babies were crying. I was worried the Internet was too rich for my britches, and we’d never manage to pack away 7.5 iridescent American fucking Lions worth of gutbusting Familinguini®. But just as the harsh presidential scowls of those 15 Xander Hambones and their scorn for my weakness could reduce me to ash, that’s when common sense finally set the fuck in. We could just drink the money away. Hell, we already had a head start on that plan before diagnosing it as the master stroke it was. So with a flourish of my limp wrist, I made a gesture probably deeply offensive to Italians beckoning the waitress, and demanded two of the most expensive bottles of wine in the house. Soon, two complex, full bodied little numbers were brought to us, each cradled in white linens like a newborn king, and just like that we were already another $7.90 in the hole.   The plan. It was working PERFECTLY.  The Olive Garden is good for two things only. It is good for grand marshaling a harrowing parade of internet-driven baloney, as you can plainly see. And it is good for getting hammered in. I honestly don’t know why you would go there to do anything other than get wasted. The only other reason to go would be if you’re a police officer replying to a 911 call furtively pocket-dialed from the restroom. Or if you’re a health inspector, scooting by to pick up your bribe wedged under the dumpster out back. That’s it. Ryan and I would take turns ordering drinks; one guy would be designated to name the drink to the waitress, while the other would follow with a snappy ultimatum, “Make it a double.” Among the first rounds she brought us were a pair of Venetian Sunsets, which we agreed to consume after a little convincing it wasn’t slang for some kind of STD. It was one of those pink drinks that gradates to something not as pink, and you aren’t supposed to drink it if you’re a man. But that’s a trick stipulation, because a real man wouldn’t give a fuck. Any guy who balks at tossing back a Venetian Sunset or a Parisian Ticklefight or a Chattanooga Handjob is in actuality a blue ribbon pony’s meticulously primped vagina. (I’m quoting Ryan’s GPS device verbatim there, FYI.) Jeffrey got some crazy drink that had so much booze in it, the glass it came in couldn’t even hold all the booze, and the rest came in this odd, graceful little vial carefully placed next to it. I don’t know what that was supposed to be and neither did he. It looked like some tiny flute of nectar you’d give to an elf to make it stop playing tricks on you.   Clearly a lot of alcohol was going to be taken in that evening. So we had a choice. We could either be treated for alcohol poisoning, taking advantage of the OG’s convenient bi-hourly shuttle service to the Springfield hospital. Or we could eat some of the atrocious bargain fare being carted to the table at impossibly frequent intervals, to absorb some of the booze. This was really the genius of the plan, here. Using the OG’s own cruel contraband, the free breadsticks, to stave off poisoning. The breadsticks are really bad, and that’s not just me going, ha ha, here are some more jokes. They’re straightup nastyloaves. Imagine one of those little Nerf footballs. Imagine it’s stripped of paint and elongated a bit. Now soak it in bleach for a week. Then, once it is white as chalk, bake it at 800 degrees for 10 minutes. Then brush the loaf in a thin but powerful adhesive solution, and completely submerge it in a vat of salt. Put five of these loves into a basket, and put five of these baskets on to the table every five minutes until the party leaves, or is otherwise removed from the restaurant.

t5_2t1sc,eightNote,1366077725,"Has it already been two weeks since I went to the Olive Garden? Hard to believe. But the good news is that the team of gastrointestinologists monitoring my condition ‘round the clock has informed me that the meal is well on its way to being digested. So that’s cool. Hold on while I try to remember what happened that night.  What happened that night was a bunch of internet weirdos walked into a Springfield Olive Garden. The aroma of irony surrounding them nearly overpowered the garlic fumes, which are typically strong enough to make the wood veneer bubble and sproing off its plane like the table was popping a boner. Those internet guys may have strolled into that Olive Garden with recklessness in their hearts. They may have been packing a titanic thirst for self abuse. They may have been fucking idiots. But I will tell you right now, what they were NOT, was fucking POOR. I was prepared. I went to the ATM and everything. I had fifteen sawbucks burning a whole in my pocket, and there were authentic Italian slaves in that building who would see to it my money was converted into fifteen pounds of pasta burning a whole in my stomach.  We probably flashed this cash around more than would be construed as decent, if we were in a place where decency wasn’t Italian for “physically assault me in the restroom, please.” (“Decencissimo, per favore. Sì grazie!”) The wad of hard collateral weighed down the table the whole time we were there, and I made good and sure the waitress could see it up front so she knew we meant business. The waitress was trained in a dialect I think OG Corporate calls Family-CasuAffable, which primarily involves pretending that strange internet people actually belong in public, and every inscrutable in-joke they blurt out is totally hilarious. She would be rewarded heavily for her role in this charade, oh yes. Primarily through self-administered alcohol and pain medication after hours, one can only hope.  While in my wallet, the one hundred and fifty dollars had naturally sopped up much of my soul’s heady puissance, and hot rainbow lasers were rioting from the eyeballs of seven and a half psychedelic Andrew Jacksons all night long. This fierce little militia of technicolor A-Jax sitting there on the table served a real purpose, and not just to remind everybody other than me how shabby and unremarkable their souls were. It reminded us of the steep hill we had to climb that evening, to somehow burn through a buck fifty at an Olive Garden, an establishment notorious for its bargains. This is a corporation which manages to turn a PROFIT by hemorrhaging tornadoes of free bread and salad by some dark fiscal entropy yet uncharted by economists. Their shit is priced to mother fucking move, you know? And here we are toting madd-staxx, sashaying like the Rockefellers into the eye of this pitiless food geyser, derricked to the earth by salmon stuccoed drywall and stock gondola music. If someone put a gun to your head, do you think you could unload just shy of eight Andy J-Bombs at an OG on ANYTHING? And by “put a gun to your head,” I mean for the purpose of this hypothetical, and not during the ordeal one naturally expects to face when entering the OG men’s room. Yeah, we weren’t so sure we could do it either. I mean, they were already putting like five upended plastic lampshades full of breadsticks on the table before we could even crack a menu and make a battleplan for carving up this soul money. Soul money which I remind you I HAD to spend. See, there really was a guy with a gun to my head. His name was THE INTERNET.  So you’ll understand when I tell you I pored over the menu in a state of critical anguish over the rock-bottom prices, crunching figures on my iPhone calculator and swearing louder than babies were crying. I was worried the Internet was too rich for my britches, and we’d never manage to pack away 7.5 iridescent American fucking Lions worth of gutbusting Familinguini®. But just as the harsh presidential scowls of those 15 Xander Hambones and their scorn for my weakness could reduce me to ash, that’s when common sense finally set the fuck in. We could just drink the money away. Hell, we already had a head start on that plan before diagnosing it as the master stroke it was. So with a flourish of my limp wrist, I made a gesture probably deeply offensive to Italians beckoning the waitress, and demanded two of the most expensive bottles of wine in the house. Soon, two complex, full bodied little numbers were brought to us, each cradled in white linens like a newborn king, and just like that we were already another $7.90 in the hole.   The plan.

t5_2qm4e,illperipheral,1366085741,"A summary from the [Center for Environmental Risk Assessment](http://www.cera-gmc.org/?action=gm_crop_database&amp;mode=ShowProd&amp;data=GTS%2040-3-2):  Background info: &gt; In plants, the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (abbreviated EPSPS) plays a key role in the biochemical pathway that results in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. This enzyme is only present in plants and microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, and is not present in animals and humans (Levin &amp; Sprinson 1964; Steinrucken &amp; Amrhein 1980; Franz et al. 1997). In the early 1970s, it was discovered that the simple amino acid analogue, glyphosate, could selectively inhibit the activity of the EPSPS enzyme, thus shutting off aromatic amino acid synthesis. Because these amino acids are needed for protein synthesis, which is required for plant growth and maintenance, the application of glyphosate quickly results in plant death (Kishore &amp; Shah 1988). Monsanto, the company which first produced glyphosate, began commercially marketing this herbicide in 1974 under the trade name Roundup®.  ...  &gt; Roundup Ready soybean event 40-3-2 was produced by introduction of the glyphosate-tolerant cp4 epsps coding sequence derived from the common soil bacterium Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 into the soybean genome using particle-acceleration transformation. The CP4 EPSPS protein is a member of the class of EPSPS proteins found ubiquitously in plants and microorganisms.  So basically they observed that, while all plants possess varieties of the EPSPS enzyme that are sensitive to glyphosate (an amino acid analogue -- its shape is very similar to amino acids, but in such a way that it blocks the activity of the enzyme), some fungi and bacteria that possess this enzyme are less susceptible. Monsanto found a soil bacterium that had a variety of the EPSPS gene that was highly resistant to glyphosate. They took this bacterial plasmid, attached it to microscopic beads (think ""shotgun pellets""), and introduced it to the soybean plant by microparticle bombardment -- essentially, they shot it like a shotgun and, after repeating the process enough times, it was finally incorporated into the genome of the seeds of one of the plants. Plants grown from these seeds are also resistant to the effects of the glyphosate, but weeds don't naturally possess this enzyme and are unable to synthesize aromatic amino acids. This is somewhat of a simplification, but that's essentially what they did. It's pretty damn cool, in my opinion, and I think that Monsanto absolutely deserves to make money off of it.",®

He has since been detained incommunicado in conditions which possibly amount to enforced disappearance and may be held at the Military Intelligence branch in Homs. He may have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated.   Mohammad Atfah, aged 20, has been volunteering with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, part of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, for the past two years. According to a local contact, he was on his way home with a friend when they were stopped at a government-operated check point in the Insha'at neighbourhood of Homs at around 9pm by persons believed to be members of the Military Intelligence. It is unclear where he was taken after the arrest as, according to a local contact, his family has not received any information concerning Mohammad Atfah’s arrest and subsequent detention. Another contact claims that former detainees at the Military Intelligence branch © Private in Homs who were released in late February said that they saw Mohammad Atfah there with bruises on his face and body as well as other wounds. He was apparently also unable to focus and was unresponsive when spoken to.  28 March 2013  Deadly mortar strike on Damascus University – indiscriminate attacks must end    A Syrian university located in a government-controlled area has been hit with mortar rockets, reportedly killing up to 15 and injuring many more in what Amnesty International branded a serious violation of the laws of war.  The attack on the Architecture Faculty of Damascus University came amid escalating fighting in the area in recent days.  “Those who endure the worst atrocities in this brutal conflict are civilians. All sides must abide by international humanitarian law and avoid attacks which indiscriminately kill and injure civilians,” said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.   “It’s not yet clear who was responsible for firing the mortars in this attack, which landed in a government-controlled area, but one thing is obvious, they are being fired into areas with a large civilian population. Mortars are completely inappropriate for use in civilian areas. Even if the intended target was a military objective, the choice of mortars to attack a target in proximity to civilians displays a callous disregard for their fate and the rules of international humanitarian law.”  “Although an armed opposition group in recent days has reportedly warned civilians to evacuate some areas in Damascus ahead of planned attacks that does not absolve them from their responsibility to minimize harm to civilians. If it appears that an attack is likely to be indiscriminate or disproportionate, it must be cancelled immediately.”  Global pressure must be applied to all parties in the Syrian conflict to abide by international humanitarian and human rights law, Amnesty International said as the League of Arab States gathered in Qatar for a summit and BRICS nations met at a separate event in South Africa.  The Arab League gathering – where the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has been given Syria’s seat after the suspension of the Syrian government in November 2011 – should see a tough message emerge against abuses perpetrated by armed groups.  “The opposition must not waver - it has both a duty and an opportunity to denounce abuses carried out by armed opposition groups and stand in line with international humanitarian law - paying lip service to it is not enough” said Ann Harrison, Amnesty International’s Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director.  While it is clear that the vast majority of war crimes and other gross violations continue to be committed by government forces, Amnesty International’s research points to an escalation in abuses by armed opposition groups, which have increasingly resorted to hostage taking and to the torture and summary killing of soldiers, pro-government militias and civilians.  In a recent briefing, Summary Killings and other abuses by armed opposition groups, the organization documented dozens of such cases.

Press Release    Document - Syria: Enforced disappearance of three Syrian men     UA: 63/13 Index: MDE 24/010/2013 Syria Date: 15 March 2013   URGENT ACTION   ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE OF THREE SYRIAN MEN   There are fears for three Syrian opposition activists held in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance for nearly six months after being arrested in Damascus.   On 20 September 2012, Abd al-Aziz al-Khayyir, Head of the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change (NCB) Foreign Affairs Office and a previous long-term prisoner of conscience; Iyas Ayash, and Maher Tahan were arrested at an Air Force Intelligence (AFI) checkpoint after arriving at Damascus Airport following a visit to China. The three men are members of the NCB, a mostly secular coalition of political groups and activists including leftists and Arab nationalists that advocates a peaceful transition of power.   The three men were in one of two cars that left the airport carrying individuals linked to the NCB. The first car proceeded past the AFI checkpoint; however, those in the second car (the three men) were taken away. Local sources indicate that the men were taken to the AFI detention centre at al-Mezzeh, Damascus, and that three weeks ago they were transferred to an unknown location. On 22 September 2012 the state news agency of the Ministry of Information, SANA, stated that the three men had been kidnapped by “members of a terrorist group”. The Syrian authorities continue to deny holding the men. As such, they are held in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance and are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment and other grave violations. The men were due to participate in a rare conference held in Damascus on 23 September 2012, which called for an end to the fighting and for a peaceful transition “to a pluralistic democratic system”. In a statement condemning the arrests before the conference on 21 September 2012, an NCB spokesman said both the Chinese and Russian authorities had assured NCB members that they would protect the conference.

t5_2stl8,LolaRuns,1366108706,"Love these. I've been thinking for a while how pets/familiars could be done in Smite. A skill dedicated to controlling the pet's aggro is a great idea. I still think path finding is gonna be the biggest obstacles to pets. You could mitigate it probably by having the pet be a flier, but even then there is the chance that it for example could get stuck inside fg's lair or have problems following when you back. So it would probably teleport directly too you after a while.   More physics engine stuff would always be great because to me that's one of the biggest neat advantages of Smite.   I like the idea of more charging (Neith I think is the only one who has that). What you describe with controlling the ability after it launches =&gt; maybe a bit like the HeBo wave only that you can move a bit while you are in it? Maybe a bit like the Vamana dash which you also control, but only that it's optional whether you want to control it depending on whether you charge. Hmmm, lots of interesting strategy here.   The idea of Sky Traps is great, again, using the verticality of Smite more. Always found it sad that the Artemis traps seemed so limited in use. I've been playing Sangue Froid lately, a game centered around traps. They also had a trap that goes off if too many people stand on it. (in Smite the trap would have to run out after a certain time period, but you would for example have it cover quite a bit of ground and place it into FG or GF and people would either have to trigger it (maybe even using enchanted minions) or wait till the trap has expired before they can safely put people there) Another thing they had was a fire that prevents neutrals from attacking till it runs out. (Could be used during the laning phase to draw minion aggro away from the tower while you back, maybe even as a consumable)   And the rainbow skybridge is just love I hope they do that, whether as an ability or as a part of a map.  ❤ ❤ ❤",❤

t5_2cneq,firemylasers,1366131545,"&gt;Dumbest post of the day. What do you think breeding does?  So now you're against reproduction as a whole? I guess you can't grow anything.  &gt;http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_food_safety/002294.html  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/business/study-raises-doubt-about-allergy-to-genetic-corn.html  &gt;In the test, the subject was given StarLink corn, other corn and a placebo on different days, without him or the doctors knowing which was which. There was no sign of an allergic reaction on any day.  http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/section-3/3-5-starlink/  &gt;1.  The Bt in Starlink corn has never been shown to be allergen and careful analysis of the Starlink event yields the conclusion that the Bt protein in Starlink, Cry9c, is mostly likely not an allergen. Contrary to Smith’s claims, most food-allergy experts believed that there was almost no chance that Starlink contained an allergen, while the EPA advisory panel apparently felt there was some very small but real chance it could become an allergen (CDC 2001, Lemaux 2008, Hefle and Taylor 2001). The problem observed with Cry9C is that it digests slowly in the simulated gastric fluid assay.  This doesn’t mean it is an allergen since indigestible proteins are not necessarily allergens.  At the time of the Starlink episode, known expert scientific opinion was backing away from an earlier proposition that protein indigestibility was an indicator of potential allergenicity.   More recently, some experts say that we should move away from the digestion assay completely because it is not predictive of allergenicity (Goodman and others 2008).  The EPA and EPA expert panels placed too much emphasis on the digestion assay.  They treated poor digestibility as an indicator of allergencity and did not sufficiently weight other data such as the fact that no Cry protein has ever caused human allergy or that the Bt protein in question, Cry9c, does not possess any structural resemblance to any known allergen.  It may be that EPA was too precautionary in their approach and sought 100 percent certainty that Cry9C was not an allergen.  &gt;3.  People were scared by the recall and many attributed their illnesses to Starlink. It is an unfortunate and well-documented fact that when scares like Starlink are announced and people then become ill, they will naturally attribute their illness to whatever is being recalled.  Think about it. If you ate a taco, became ill a couple of hours later, and then heard that taco shells were being recalled by the government, wouldn’t it enter your mind that maybe your illness was due to the taco you just ate?  Consumers can’t be criticized for thinking that if something is being recalled it must be dangerous.  In fact, dozens of claimed Starlink-related illnesses were carefully investigated and not a single subject had an IgE antibody that reacted with Cry9C—the Gold Standard test required to show allergenicity (Hefle and Taylor 2001).  There is no evidence that a single consumer was actually hurt by Starlink.  http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/summary.htm  &gt;On October 25, 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in investigating adverse event reports (AERs) of human illnesses that were potentially associated with consumption of genetically modified corn products. Prior to these reports, a protein named Cry9c had been inserted into genetically modified StarLink™ corn; it subsequently and inadvertently was introduced into the human food supply. CDC conducted an epidemiological investigation that included (1) reviewing the AERs, (2) administering questionnaires to all people who experienced adverse health effects and manifested signs and symptoms consistent with allergic reaction, (3) obtaining relevant medical records, and (4) collecting serum samples for temporary banking. The investigation concluded that 28 people had experienced apparent allergic reactions. These people had also reported eating corn products that may have contained Cry9c protein. With the endorsement of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Scientific Advisory Panel which convened on November 28, 2000, CDC recommended that the banked serum samples be evaluated to see if they contained evidence of an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;An FDA laboratory developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect antibodies to the Cry9c protein. CDC sent coded serum samples to FDA for analysis, including serum samples from the affected people and historically banked serum samples collected before Cry9c entered the food supply. CDC also sent serum samples from people identified as being highly sensitive to a variety of allergens. The ELISA method found that none of the CDC-submitted samples reacted in a manner consistent with an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;These findings do not provide any evidence that the reactions that the affected people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Cry9c protein.

If you're looking for quick and easy, try stuff you can eat raw for a snack, like bell peppers, carrots, celery, or cucumber.

t5_2r9vp,Masterray4,1366137129,"why dont you google it? ""In the United States, one in six teenagers has driven under the influence of marijuana. Driving under the influence of marijuana and alcohol is equally prevalent, despite the fact that marijuana use is less common than alcohol use. Much of the research examining the effects of marijuana on driving performance was conducted in the 1970s and led to equivocal findings. During that time, few studies included women and driving simulators were rudimentary. Further, the potency of marijuana commonly used recreationally has increased. This study examined sex differences in the acute effects of marijuana on driving performance using a realistic, validated driving simulator. Eighty-five subjects (n = 50 males, 35 females) participated in this between-subjects, double-blind, placebo controlled study. In addition to an uneventful, baseline segment of driving, participants were challenged with collision avoidance and distracted driving scenarios. Under the influence of marijuana, participants decreased their speed and failed to show expected practice effects during a distracted drive. No differences were found during the baseline driving segment or collision avoidance scenarios. No differences attributable to sex were observed. This study enhances the current literature by identifying distracted driving and the integration of prior experience as particularly problematic under the influence of marijuana."" So male or female no differences where found BUT STILL SHOWED IMPAIRED DRIVING HABITS WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE. Here is a more recent one with exact numbers on dosage  ""Medicinal Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol) impairs on-the-road driving performance of occasional and heavy cannabis users but is not detected in Standard Field Sobriety Tests. Bosker WM, Kuypers KP, Theunissen EL, Surinx A, Blankespoor RJ, Skopp G, Jeffery WK, Walls HC, van Leeuwen CJ, Ramaekers JG. Source  Department of Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology, Faculty Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands. Abstract AIMS:  The acute and chronic effects of dronabinol [medicinal Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)] on actual driving performance and the Standard Field Sobriety Test (SFST) were assessed. It was hypothesized that occasional users would be impaired on these tests and that heavy users would show less impairment due to tolerance. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:  Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-way cross-over study. Twelve occasional and 12 heavy cannabis users (14 males/10 females) received single doses of placebo, 10 and 20 mg dronabinol. MEASUREMENTS:  Standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP; i.e. weaving) is the primary measure of road-tracking control. Time to speed adaptation (TSA) is the primary reaction-time measure in the car-following test. Percentage of impaired individuals on the SFST and subjective high on a visual analogue scale were secondary measures. FINDINGS:  Superiority tests showed that SDLP (P = 0.008) and TSA (P = 0.011) increased after dronabinol in occasional users. Equivalence tests demonstrated that dronabinol-induced increments in SDLP were bigger than impairment associated with BAC of 0.5 mg/ml in occasional and heavy users, although the magnitude of driving impairment was generally less in heavy users. The SFST did not discriminate between conditions. Levels of subjective high were comparable in occasional and heavy users. CONCLUSIONS:  Dronabinol (medicinal tetrahydrocannabinol) impairs driving performance in occasional and heavy users in a dose-dependent way, but to a lesser degree in heavy users due possibly to tolerance. The Standard Field Sobriety Test is not sensitive to clinically relevant driving impairment caused by oral tetrahydrocannabinol.  © 2012 The Authors.

It is second nature to me. I have never had an accident or even a ticket, just 1 warning for running a stop sign. How ever it still impairs my thinking, I'm slower to react but can function.

Only unused runes will show up on the list of runes to combine. As there are no tier 4 runes, only two tier 3 runes can be sacrificed. Runes of different tier cannot be combined.   The Rune Combiner can produce runes of which you already own 9 (thus making the new rune useless unless used for another rune combination)   Certain runes do not appear to be available via the rune combiner (armor penetration, magic penetration, hybrid penetration and perhaps others). As these are some of the most valuable of the runes, and in IP terms most expensive, the expected value of runes given by the combiner is quite low, as the probability is quite higher of receiving secondary runes and other runes of questionable value. In addition, some reports indicate that certain runes are considerably more likely to appear than others, though this has not been verified (seals of armor, marks of scaling attack damage, etc.).

Yes, that may seem like a lot if you're making $9 an hour, but it's a *massive* pay cut for someone like him. You're not going to find many people with his level of experience and knowledge that would be willing to work for that salary, especially when you consider the gigantic shitshow that he's walking into.   The majority of protests and complaints I've read about Orr and Jones Day seem to be made by people with little understanding of how a law firm operates. It's borderline obnoxious to believe that a massive firm would take anything that might constitute a legitimate conflict of interest.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1366175992,"&gt;Also for people who are not familiar with the Old Testament, if we were still living in the old law, we would all be going to hell,  I've got some very bad news for your friend.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

t5_2rd2l,eightNote,1366179853,"Has it already been two weeks since I went to the Olive Garden? Hard to believe. But the good news is that the team of gastrointestinologists monitoring my condition ‘round the clock has informed me that the meal is well on its way to being digested. So that’s cool. Hold on while I try to remember what happened that night.  What happened that night was a bunch of internet weirdos walked into a Springfield Olive Garden. The aroma of irony surrounding them nearly overpowered the garlic fumes, which are typically strong enough to make the wood veneer bubble and sproing off its plane like the table was popping a boner. Those internet guys may have strolled into that Olive Garden with recklessness in their hearts. They may have been packing a titanic thirst for self abuse. They may have been fucking idiots. But I will tell you right now, what they were NOT, was fucking POOR. I was prepared. I went to the ATM and everything. I had fifteen sawbucks burning a whole in my pocket, and there were authentic Italian slaves in that building who would see to it my money was converted into fifteen pounds of pasta burning a whole in my stomach.  We probably flashed this cash around more than would be construed as decent, if we were in a place where decency wasn’t Italian for “physically assault me in the restroom, please.” (“Decencissimo, per favore. Sì grazie!”) The wad of hard collateral weighed down the table the whole time we were there, and I made good and sure the waitress could see it up front so she knew we meant business. The waitress was trained in a dialect I think OG Corporate calls Family-CasuAffable, which primarily involves pretending that strange internet people actually belong in public, and every inscrutable in-joke they blurt out is totally hilarious. She would be rewarded heavily for her role in this charade, oh yes. Primarily through self-administered alcohol and pain medication after hours, one can only hope.  While in my wallet, the one hundred and fifty dollars had naturally sopped up much of my soul’s heady puissance, and hot rainbow lasers were rioting from the eyeballs of seven and a half psychedelic Andrew Jacksons all night long. This fierce little militia of technicolor A-Jax sitting there on the table served a real purpose, and not just to remind everybody other than me how shabby and unremarkable their souls were. It reminded us of the steep hill we had to climb that evening, to somehow burn through a buck fifty at an Olive Garden, an establishment notorious for its bargains. This is a corporation which manages to turn a PROFIT by hemorrhaging tornadoes of free bread and salad by some dark fiscal entropy yet uncharted by economists. Their shit is priced to mother fucking move, you know? And here we are toting madd-staxx, sashaying like the Rockefellers into the eye of this pitiless food geyser, derricked to the earth by salmon stuccoed drywall and stock gondola music. If someone put a gun to your head, do you think you could unload just shy of eight Andy J-Bombs at an OG on ANYTHING? And by “put a gun to your head,” I mean for the purpose of this hypothetical, and not during the ordeal one naturally expects to face when entering the OG men’s room. Yeah, we weren’t so sure we could do it either. I mean, they were already putting like five upended plastic lampshades full of breadsticks on the table before we could even crack a menu and make a battleplan for carving up this soul money. Soul money which I remind you I HAD to spend. See, there really was a guy with a gun to my head. His name was THE INTERNET.  So you’ll understand when I tell you I pored over the menu in a state of critical anguish over the rock-bottom prices, crunching figures on my iPhone calculator and swearing louder than babies were crying. I was worried the Internet was too rich for my britches, and we’d never manage to pack away 7.5 iridescent American fucking Lions worth of gutbusting Familinguini®. But just as the harsh presidential scowls of those 15 Xander Hambones and their scorn for my weakness could reduce me to ash, that’s when common sense finally set the fuck in. We could just drink the money away. Hell, we already had a head start on that plan before diagnosing it as the master stroke it was. So with a flourish of my limp wrist, I made a gesture probably deeply offensive to Italians beckoning the waitress, and demanded two of the most expensive bottles of wine in the house. Soon, two complex, full bodied little numbers were brought to us, each cradled in white linens like a newborn king, and just like that we were already another $7.90 in the hole.   The plan. It was working PERFECTLY.  The Olive Garden is good for two things only. It is good for grand marshaling a harrowing parade of internet-driven baloney, as you can plainly see. And it is good for getting hammered in. I honestly don’t know why you would go there to do anything other than get wasted. The only other reason to go would be if you’re a police officer replying to a 911 call furtively pocket-dialed from the restroom. Or if you’re a health inspector, scooting by to pick up your bribe wedged under the dumpster out back. That’s it. Ryan and I would take turns ordering drinks; one guy would be designated to name the drink to the waitress, while the other would follow with a snappy ultimatum, “Make it a double.” Among the first rounds she brought us were a pair of Venetian Sunsets, which we agreed to consume after a little convincing it wasn’t slang for some kind of STD. It was one of those pink drinks that gradates to something not as pink, and you aren’t supposed to drink it if you’re a man. But that’s a trick stipulation, because a real man wouldn’t give a fuck. Any guy who balks at tossing back a Venetian Sunset or a Parisian Ticklefight or a Chattanooga Handjob is in actuality a blue ribbon pony’s meticulously primped vagina. (I’m quoting Ryan’s GPS device verbatim there, FYI.) Jeffrey got some crazy drink that had so much booze in it, the glass it came in couldn’t even hold all the booze, and the rest came in this odd, graceful little vial carefully placed next to it. I don’t know what that was supposed to be and neither did he. It looked like some tiny flute of nectar you’d give to an elf to make it stop playing tricks on you.   Clearly a lot of alcohol was going to be taken in that evening. So we had a choice. We could either be treated for alcohol poisoning, taking advantage of the OG’s convenient bi-hourly shuttle service to the Springfield hospital. Or we could eat some of the atrocious bargain fare being carted to the table at impossibly frequent intervals, to absorb some of the booze. This was really the genius of the plan, here. Using the OG’s own cruel contraband, the free breadsticks, to stave off poisoning. The breadsticks are really bad, and that’s not just me going, ha ha, here are some more jokes. They’re straightup nastyloaves. Imagine one of those little Nerf footballs. Imagine it’s stripped of paint and elongated a bit. Now soak it in bleach for a week. Then, once it is white as chalk, bake it at 800 degrees for 10 minutes. Then brush the loaf in a thin but powerful adhesive solution, and completely submerge it in a vat of salt. Put five of these loves into a basket, and put five of these baskets on to the table every five minutes until the party leaves, or is otherwise removed from the restaurant.   Is that enough of this story? I’m gonna say yeah. The bottom line is, the plan was a huge success, in that we’re all basically still alive somehow. ",®

t5_2saqe,eur0pa,1366184193,"So um, you train six times a week, right? Then, you have one rest day. I remember doing that years ago, it felt great. Anyway. C'mere, tell ya a secret — *LG/IF works because of rest days*.  Meal timing? Underfeeding and overfeeding windows? Carb cycling? That's the unimportant stuff; what counts is your -20 or -30 rest day. Calories, that's what counts. If you plan on working out six times a week it means that you will be at a surplus (+20 in your case) six times a week. Let's do some math:  * **TDEE** = 2300kcal/die → 16100kcal/wk | ±20% = 1840, 2760 * **Weekly**: (2760 × 6) + 1840 = 18400kcal/wk → 2628kcal/die * **≈** (18400 - 16100) = +2300kcal/wk ≈ **0.66lb/wk gain**  There really is no way around it. Of course most of your surplus will be used to repair and build your lean mass, but you will gain weight nonetheless. That's to be expected if running a surplus.  My 2¢? LG is not made for you, as it's not made for me when I'm packing on mass during the winter. I'll have my breakfast, my four or five meals a day, my lavish amount of calories and my five/six workouts a week. I wouldn't even go on a deficit on sunday, because it would be meaningless. You know what, just eat at a constant +10↔+15 on your TDEE and lift heavy shit, see in some months what you'd like to do — when your objective is *cutting* you'll come back and settle for a 3 days/wk training and a -10/-30 cut.  Best of luck mate.",↔

t5_mouw,SerMyLady,1366207907,"The article gives the percentage of migraine patients with a history of colic (72.6%), the percentage of patients without migraine with a history of colic (26.5%) as well as the total number of each group: 208 patients with migraines, 471 patients without migraines.  Using the power of Math™ we can then work out the following:  * 346 kids with no migraines, no history of colic * 125 kids with no migraines, history of colic * 57 kids with migraines, no history of colic * 151 kids with migraines, history of colic  Meaning the percentage of children with a history of colic that are migraine patients is 54.7%.  I have absolutely no idea how you were trying to work it out but it seems to me that you were finding 72.6% of 23% for kids with migraines with a history of colic, which will result in a high estimate (as acknowledge by you). But then it seems to me like you're treating the group ""has a history of colic"" (16%-20%, 20% for convenience) as ""no migraines, has a history of colic"" and and adding the migraines with a history of colic group to it (i.e. 0.2+(0.726·0.23)) to get a special version of the group ""has a history of colic"" (~36.7%). Then you're dividing the migraine/colicky group by the *special* (i.e. colicky + colicky/migrane) colicky group to get ~45%.  The problem with this is that the 16-20% group all the colicky group so already includes ""migraines with a history of colic"" so it's incorrect to add it again. Instead you could just divide your migraine&amp;colicky group (0.725·0.23) by the colicky group (0.2) to find the estimated percentage of colicky babies that develop migraines of 83.5%. Of course as you already acknowledge it's a very high estimate because you used the 23% migraine rate so it doesn't really say anything.",™

t5_2qhbe,valkyrie123,1366212493,"Checklist: What To Do When Someone Dies © by Newland &amp; Associates Prepared June 2002  What do I need to do now? That is the question I sometimes hear from clients after the death of a loved one. The following matters should be considered when a close friend or relative dies. Not all of the points will apply to all Decedents, but many of them will. I have tried to put them into a logical sequence, but as always, practical sense should prevail:  1. If a doctor is not present, notify a doctor or coroner in order to obtain a death certificate.  2. If the death occurs at home, you may need to contact a local police officer or coroner.  3. If the Decedent wished, a donation of body parts and tissues should be considered.  4. Notify family and friends. You may want to consider having family members contact others to save yourself some time on the phone during a stressful period.  5. Look for instructions which the Decedent may have left regarding preferences for funeral and burial arrangements.  6. Determine if the Decedent belonged to a burial or memorial society that may make special arrangements for the funeral, such as military honor guards.  7. Contact a funeral home concerning burial or cremation arrangements.  8. Complete funeral and burial arrangements.  9. Contact the Social Security Administration and any other government agencies or benefit program that may be making payments to the Decedent. (Note that the payment for the month of death will not be made by the Social Security Administration and others.)  10. Review the Decedents financial affairs and look for any estate planning documents, such as Wills and Trusts, along with any other relevant documents, including:   •	Funeral and Burial Plans;  •	Safe Deposit Agreements and keys;  •	Nuptial Agreements;  •	Life Insurance Policies;  •	Existence of Trust;  •	Pension-retirement benefits;  •	Old tax returns;  •	Prior Gift Tax returns;  •	Marriage, birth and death certificates;  •	Divorce documentation;  •	Computer records regarding books of a business or personal assets;  •	Bank statements, checkbooks, similar documents;  •	Notes receivable;  •	Titles to motor vehicles;  •	Leases;  •	Securities and list of securities;  •	Any documentation of business ownership or business interest;  •	Health Insurance, make claims for the final illness; and  •	Unpaid bills.  11. If there is a Will, take the Will to the appropriate County or City office to have it accepted for probate.  12. Administering the Will - If the Will is properly drawn, it will name a Personal Representative (also known as Executor or Executrix). The Personal Representative, who can be an individual, a group of individuals or one or more institutions, or a combination of the aforementioned, will be responsible for the administration of the Estate of the Decedent.  13. If there is no Will and there are sufficient assets to probate (typically, at least $15,000 in Virginia), then the Court will appoint an administrator and the assets of the Decedent will be distributed according to state law. This situation is referred to by some as having the state write a Will for you. All states have a set of laws relating to intestate succession (transfer of property after dying without a Will), and the states decide who gets which assets if someone dies without a Will.   14. If you are the Personal Representative or Successor Trustee of a Trust, try to make a list of the assets owned by the Decedent or the Trust, in order that they can be administered and distributed according to the wishes of the Decedent.  15. Open a bank account for the estate of the Decedent. This should be done early on and all receipts and disbursements should be recorded in that bank account, in order to account properly for the assets of the Decedent and the expenses of administration.  16. Probate is a process similar to that of accounting. The Personal Representative is responsible for collecting  the assets and reporting to the Court as to the amount of assets in the Estate of the Decedent. The Personal Representative then assembles the assets and, after paying debts, expenses and taxes, distributes the assets according to the wishes of the Decedent. If the Decedent left no Will, the process of administration is essentially the same, except that state law determines to whom the assets are distributed. If everything is done correctly, eventually, after the Personal Representative has accounted for and distributed the assets, the Personal Representative is discharged.  17. Make an inventory of household goods, personal belongings and the like, in order that they can be accounted for and properly distributed.  18. Look for insurance policies or annuities which may continue for other family members and other assets.  Contact the Insurer with respect to any current policies or annuities.  19. Try to assemble the deeds of the Decedent to see what real estate, if any, is owned by the Decedent.  If real estate is owned in more than one state, special proceedings, called ""ancillary administrations,"" may be needed in each state.  20. Determine if the Decedent owned any securities, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.  21. Retirement Plans, IRA accounts and similar retirement benefits involve important choices which need to be made by certain beneficiaries, particularly in regard to IRA accounts under recent IRS regulations. If there are annuities, pension and profit sharing plans and interest of that type, they may provide for joint payment to a surviving spouse or others.  22. If the Decedent controlled or was a principal person in a business, it may be necessary to check to see if there are Buy-Sell Agreements under which the interest of the Decedent would be purchased by the business entity or other business owners.  23. If, after the appointment of a Personal Representative, a bank account or safe deposit box is found, then the assets in the bank account or safe deposit box need to be distributed according to the wishes of the Decedent.  24. If the Decedent was indebted to anyone, then the creditor needs to be paid. If the creditors are not paid and they make a claim against the estate after all of the assets are distributed, the Personal Representative may be in trouble and held personally liable for the debt.  25. As part of the probate process, all family members within a certain degree of kinship must be contacted, whether or not they receive assets from the Estate of the Decedent.  26. In handling the affairs of a Decedent, do not be quick to make distributions to family members or friends of the Decedent. Important choices need to be made concerning such distributions and, of course, they need to be in compliance with the Will or other instructions left by the Decedent, not to mention any applicable tax laws.  27. The income taxes of the Decedent for the year of death need to be filed, and any tax due must be paid. If there is a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse and Decedent can file a joint return for the year of death.  28. If there is a Trust, particularly a Revocable Living Trust, it will become irrevocable at the time of death, if not before. A separate tax return, Form 1041, Fiduciary Income Tax Return, needs to be filed for the Trust or the Estate of the Decedent if income is received by the Estate or a Trust.   29. If there are minor children and the Will provides for a guardian, then the guardian needs to be informed and the children need to be placed in the care of the guardian. If there are minor children and no guardian is appointed, or if there is no Will, then the Court must appoint a guardian.  30. If there is real estate that is insured, the Personal Representative should make sure that the insurance policies on the properties of the Decedent are maintained.  31. Be deliberate and do not be hasty with decisions or distributions. The death of someone, particularly a family member or friend, is stressful and often if there are children of the Decedent around during the course of the final illness, there may be disputes regarding the treatment or other problems related to declining physical or mental abilities of the parent. Stated differently, it is a time of frazzled nerves and irritable people, so be very careful not to create schisms which can last for a very long time.  32. Watch out for people who prey upon families of Decedents. There are people who look for death notices and make unfounded claims against the Decedent. Some may also attempt to burglarize the home during the funeral service. Be cautious about such matters; have someone stay at the home during the funeral service and do not easily accept the claims of unknown individuals that lack documentation.  33. If there is a surviving spouse, make sure veterans benefits or other ""joint and survivor"" benefits are collected by the surviving spouse. If you need further assistance, call Dan Newland (800-553-6613). While this list is rather extensive, no list can be 100% complete, so there is bound to be some situation that has been overlooked or not adequately treated.  My condolences. Let your Grandmother know how much you love her. I lost my mother a couple years ago and this list came in very handy.   Edit: PS: I know it will be difficult but try to have a happy cake day. ",©

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1366223945,"&gt;###Developer Update: Jedi Knight Class Changes - 04.17.2013  &gt;Hello everyone. My name is Austin Peckenpaugh, and I’m a Senior Designer on Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, responsible for class design and combat systems. As such, I’m here to shed some light on the changes to the Jedi Knight class in Game Update 2.0.  &gt;We’ll be writing about recent class changes coming to The Old Republic, but this time we’re going a little more in depth and taking on one class (for both factions) at a time. If we haven’t covered your class yet, do not despair; it will be covered in the coming days.  &gt;##Combat Systems  &gt;**Alacrity Improvements:** One of the big changes to combat systems is the way that Alacrity works. Prior to this update, Alacrity came with a tradeoff for some classes, and it was nearly useless to other classes. The faster you attacked, the more resources you would spend, and that only worked if you had channeled abilities or abilities with activation times.  &gt;Now, Alacrity will increase the activation speed of all abilities, including instants. We haven’t just shortened the global cooldown, either. When activating any ability quicker, its animation will also play quicker. This makes some attacks look and sound very cool. Furthermore, Alacrity increases resource regeneration by the same rate, helping you to recuperate resources more quickly as you spend them more quickly. For Knights and Warriors specifically, attacking faster means generating resources faster. Now more Alacrity is strictly a good thing.  &gt;**DoT Improvements:** We’ve changed the way we evaluate damage over time effects, so it should now be less costly to keep your DoTs up and to spread them around.  &gt;**Shield Improvements**: We’ve changed the way shields work to allow them to absorb any incoming kinetic or energy damage regardless of the source (melee, ranged, Force, tech – doesn’t matter). This has significantly increased the importance of shields, and the game has been rebalanced to account for such a major adjustment.  &gt;**Accuracy Matters:** In 2.0, all Elite (gold star) and tougher enemies will have additional defense chances against Force and tech attacks. As a result, Accuracy Rating will play a pivotal role in optimizing your sustained damage in boss fights. Prior to 2.0, Accuracy Rating was valued very differently from class to class (or even spec to spec), and while it’s still different for each class or spec, that difference is now much smaller. In effect, all damage-dealing roles will find Accuracy Rating much more useful than before.  &gt;##Sentinel  &gt;**Twin Saber Throw (New ability):** This ability throws both sabers forward, dealing high damage to everything in their path. Upon striking a target, that target is additionally slowed by 50% for 6 seconds. 18-second cooldown.  &gt;Below are some additional details on changes made to the Sentinel’s skill trees. Many more skills than the ones mentioned here have changed; these are really just the highlights.  &gt;***Watchman***  &gt;Watchman has always had a strong rotation with good sustained damage and utility. We didn’t want to mess with the formula to Watchman’s success, so we just made them better at doing what they already do.  &gt;* **Weakening Wounds:** This new utility skill causes your burning targets to deal less damage. * **Zealous Ward:** This new utility skill causes you to heal for a percent of your maximum health when attacked while Saber Ward is active. * **Inexhaustible Zeal:** Increases the maximum stack size of Juyo Form and Merciless Slash by 1. With this skill, Juyo Form stacks up to 6 times and Merciless Slash stacks up to 4 times, ultimately giving Merciless Slash a 6-second cooldown. * **Burning Focus:** Burning Focus will help give you the Focus you need to fuel more Merciless Slashes. Your direct damage attacks that critically hit a target have a chance to build 1 Focus.  &gt;***Combat***  &gt;Combat has been criticized for being a little too simple to play. While they have lots of fun utility, their core rotation was a little boring. However, some players like a more relaxed playstyle, so it’s important to us that we don’t change things too much.  &gt;To that end, we’ve helped unlock Combat’s most fun utility (Transcendence, right?), and livened up their core rotational gameplay with a deadly new proc effect.  &gt;* **Saber Screen:** Sentinels in general have great survivability tools, but their passive survivability is very low. In large part, this is intentional, but Combat receives very few survivability boosts even for a Sentinel. With Saber Screen, each time your Ataru Form procs, you gain a stacking damage reduction buff. * **Contemplation:** With this new skill, whenever you use a “rest” ability (Introspection, Carbonite Chamber, etc), you generate Centering over the channel duration. This lets Combat front-load a Zen, Transcendence, or Inspiration without having to use Valorous Call! * **Hand of Justice:** When your Ataru Form triggers, you have a chance to gain Hand of Justice, which finishes the cooldown on Precision Slash and Dispatch and makes your next Dispatch free and usable on any target at any health level.  &gt;***Focus (Sentinel)***  &gt;Our intentions with Focus Sentinels in 2.0 are to continue to support their viable sustained damage, but to lessen the burst potential of Force Sweep. This isn’t solely about correcting issues though, so we’ve also added some gameplay improvements and better utility to Focus.  &gt;* **Changes to Force Sweep:** Force Sweep hits for significantly less in 2.0, reducing Focus’s on demand burst. However, Force Sweep is now responsible for less of Focus’s overall damage output, so these changes don’t negatively impact Focus’s sustained damage.     * **Singularity Acquisition:** Singularity is no longer acquired from Force Stasis. Now, stacks of Singularity are acquired from Zen (in Shii-Cho Form) and damage dealt by Force Exhaustion.     * **Focused Resonance:** Previously, this skill increased the critical damage of Force attacks by 30%. In 2.0, it increases the critical damage of all attacks by 15%. * **Redistributed Damage:** Damage has been redistributed from Force Sweep into other abilities, reducing Force Sweep’s contribution to your overall damage while increasing that of other key abilities.     * **Focused Resonance:** As previously mentioned, Focused Resonance now affects all abilities by a lesser amount.     * **Force Lash:** Slash deals additional energy damage as Force damage.     * **Heightened Power:** Increases all damage dealt by 9% (at 3 points) for 6 seconds after using Force Sweep. This does not apply to the Force Sweep that triggered this effect. * **New Utility:** Focus had previously been a one-trick pony, with the thought being that the burst it provided effectively served as its utility. With that way of thinking behind us, Focus has received some new and improved utility skills.     * **Second Wind and Jedi Enforcer:** Second Wind has been replaced by Jedi Enforcer, which increases the damage dealt by Rebuke and increases its duration.     * **Pulse:** Now reduces the cooldown of Force Stasis.     * **Incisor:** This new skill gives Force Leap and Zealous Leap a chance to slow the target by 50% for 6 seconds.     * **Agility Training:** This skill now makes Zealous Leap usable while immobilized.     * **Force Health:** Reduces the health spent by Guarded by the Force and causes Twin Saber Throw to generate Focus.",™

Many more skills than the ones mentioned here have changed; these are really just the highlights.  &gt;***Annihilation***  &gt;Annihilation has always had a strong rotation with good sustained damage and utility. We didn’t want to mess with the formula to Annihilation’s success, so we just made them better at doing what they already do.  &gt;* **Agonizing Sabers:** This new utility skill causes your bleeding targets to deal less damage. * **Blood Ward**: This new utility skill causes you to heal for a percent of your maximum health when attacked while Saber Ward is active. * **Indefatigable Onslaught:** Increases the maximum stack size of Juyo Form and Annihilate by 1. With this skill, Juyo Form stacks up to 6 times and Annihilate stacks up to 4 times, ultimately giving Annihilate a 6-second cooldown. * **Bloodlust:** Bloodlust will help give you the Rage you need to fuel more Annihilates. Your direct damage attacks that critically hit a target have a chance to build 1 Rage.  &gt;***Carnage*** Carnage has been criticized for being a little too simple to play. While they have lots of fun utility, their core rotation was a little boring. However, some players like a more relaxed playstyle, so it’s important to us that we don’t change things too much.  &gt;To that end, we’ve helped unlock Carnage’s most fun utility (Predation, right?), and livened up their core rotational gameplay with a deadly new proc effect.  &gt;* **Frenzied Sabers**: Marauders in general have great survivability tools, but their passive survivability is very low. In large part, this is intentional, but Carnage receives very few survivability boosts even for a Marauder. With Frenzied Sabers, each time your Ataru Form procs, you gain a stacking damage reduction buff. * **Brooding:** With this new skill, whenever you use a “rest” ability (Channel Hatred, Carbonite Chamber, etc), you generate Fury over the channel duration. This lets Carnage front-load a Berserk, Predation, or Bloodthirst without having to use Frenzy! * **Slaughter:** When your Ataru Form triggers, you have a chance to gain Slaughter, which finishes the cooldown on Gore and Vicious Throw and makes your next Vicious Throw free and usable on any target at any health level.  &gt; ***Rage (Marauder)***  &gt;Our intentions with Rage Marauders in 2.0 are to continue to support their viable sustained damage, but to lessen the burst potential of Smash. This isn’t solely about correcting issues though, so we’ve also added some gameplay improvements and better utility to Rage.  &gt;* **Changes to Smash:** Smash hits for significantly less in 2.0, reducing Rage’s on demand burst. However, Smash is now responsible for less of Rage’s overall damage output, so these changes don’t negatively impact Rage’s sustained damage.  &gt;    * **Shockwave Acquisition**: Shockwave is no longer acquired from Force Choke. Now, stacks of Shockwave are acquired from Berserk (in Shii-Cho Form) and damage dealt by Force Crush.     * **Dark Resonance:** Previously, this skill increased the critical damage of Force attacks by 30%. In 2.0, it increases the critical damage of all attacks by 15%.  &gt;* **Redistributed Damage:** Damage has been redistributed from Smash into other abilities, reducing Smash’s contribution to your overall damage while increasing that of other key abilities.     * **Dark Resonance:** As previously mentioned, Dark Resonance now affects all abilities by a lesser amount.     * **Force Lash:** Vicious Slash deals additional energy damage as Force damage.     * **Cascading Power:** Increases all damage dealt by 9% (at 3 points) for 6 seconds after using Smash. This does not apply to the Smash that triggered this effect.  &gt;* **New Utility:** Rage had previously been a one-trick pony, with the thought being that the burst it provided effectively served as its utility. With that way of thinking behind us, Rage has received some new and improved utility skills.     * **Payback and Cloak of Rage:** Payback has been replaced by Cloak of Rage, which increases the damage dealt by Cloak of Pain and increases its duration.     * **Strangulate:** Now reduces the cooldown of Force Choke.     * **Interceptor:** This skill has been moved and repurposed. It now gives Force Charge and Obliterate a chance to slow the target by 50% for 6 seconds.     * **Force Jump:** This new skill makes Obliterate usable while immobilized.     * **Force Vigor:** Reduces the health spent by Undying Rage and causes Dual Saber Throw to generate Rage.

We see hackathons as building a foundation for the startups of tomorrow; ideas and strong technical talent. That’s why we built the AngelHack Accelerator, so teams with a bigger vision can take their idea all the way from hack to start-up.  &gt;The AngelHack Competition rules below are the same around the world and allow everyone at every location an equal opportunity for success. If you follow the rules then you are eligible for the grand prize, acceptance into the AngelHack Accelerator. That said, if winning the competition is of no interest to you, then be a little honey badger ☺  &gt;1. Fresh Code We all start coding at the same time — 12pm (noon) local time. Prior to this time you may work on your design, logo, wireframes, idea validation, make digital mockups, you name it. But no coding can be done beforehand. This allows you to spend your time at AngelHack doing what you love best — HACKING :)  &gt;2. It’s okay to Hack! Feel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, frameworks, or workarounds you’ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. Use any language, hosting service, etc. you please  &gt;3. Ownership and IP  Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.  &gt;4. Submissions  Each hack will have a unique hackathon.io page and each team must submit their project by 1:30pm on Sunday.  &gt;5. Have fun  It’s a hackathon! Use whatever languages or hacks you have in your arsenal. Show us hardware. Show us new concepts. Show us anything you’d like. ",☺

t5_2rawz,stgrusty,1366232709,"I only can speak to US copyright fair-use: Although you did kind of apply the four-factor analysis to determine whether something is fair use, I do not believe your suggested use would legally likely automatically fall under ""fair use"" as defined at *17 USC § 107* - this is because your use which you define as ""communal enjoyment and sharing"" could not be reasonably be said to be for one of the allowable purposes of fair use:  &gt;  for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research  Although, without researching and currently binding case law, I may be wrong on this. Others please provide more info if available.                                                  --------------------------------   If you get songs exclusively from soundcloud then I have some good and bad news, mostly good:  I went through the soundcloud terms of use very quickly here: https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#grant-of-license  As far as I can tell the most relevant section is ""grant of license"" where it outlines:  &gt; This section explains how your content will be used on SoundCloud® and the permissions that you grant by uploading your content - for example, the right for other users to listen to your sounds.  From what I quickly read in the ""Grant of License"" section, users who upload songs can control exactly what rights they give to users of the ""platform"" (soundcloud) through the uploader personally selecting what other users are allowed to do in relation to THEIR music, such as only allowing the music to be played through the soundcloud platform or allowing for everyone to freely download the song in mp3 format.  -----------------   I come to the conclusion that you should be fine downloading songs **through the soundcloud platform** (as opposed to a download button not being available and digitally recording the song as it's being played) and playing them on your podcast. Just remember that this is assuming the uploaded music is not already infringing on someone else's copyright. *For the following reasons:*  * 1) When a user uploads his original work and makes it available for download, that uploader is granting all users [where ever you are in the world, rights are granted ""world-wide""] and soundcloud certain limited rights to:  &gt; By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, **licence to other users of the Platform**, and to operators and users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your Content has been shared or embedded using the Services (“Linked Services”), **to use, copy, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public**   *[emphasis added]* - Second paragraph of ""Grant of License""  * 2) As seen in the quote above, users of soundcloud have a *""royalty-free""* limited license to *""to use, copy, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public""* works that others have uploaded and made available for download/playback  * 3) Although you, as an user of soundcloud, have rights relating to all uploaded music on soundcloud, such as the relevant ""make available and otherwise communicate to the public,"" my reading suggests to me that if an uploader has not made the song available for download, technically, your license is effectively more ""limited"" in that to exercise any of the license privileges, you must only play the song DIRECTLY from the soundcloud platform. i.e. the uploader, by not allowing for direct download, has not granted other users of soundcloud the license to download the songs [and then ""use, copy, repost...""] and thus you, as an ""other user,"" must do things like ""publicly display"" the work directly from soundcloud.    Basically, if you are planning on using just soundcloud files, you should be fine to use them on your podcast without any notice to the owners, since the owners, by uploading, agreed to grant certain limited license privileges to other users of soundcloud.

t5_2qmlu,mudclub,1366234384,"I'm definitely interested - thanks!  My initial impressions:  &gt; Nicotine delivery per puff A 35 mL puff from the Ruyan® V8 delivers only 10% of the nicotine obtained from a similar puff of a Marlboro regular cigarette. Deeper 50 mL puffs from the Ruyan V8 delivers only slightly more nicotine.   I *assume* that is the amount of nicotine carried in the vapor of the puff rather than the amount of nicotine absorbed.  &gt; Nicotine dose (Figure 2) An e-cigarette user will need to take more puffs more often, and deeper puffs confer no advantage for V8 users. Six puffs every 5 minutes would deliver the same dose of nicotine delivered by shallow inhaling (10 puffs of 35 mL per puff) from one tobacco cigarette every hour, but would not achieve the high immediate nicotine boost which many smokers crave. Nicotine overdose is unlikely, even though nicotine delivery may vary between brands.  I assume they arrived at the ""6 puffs every 5 minutes"" based on the amount of nicotine contained in the vapor of each puff.  The number that shakes out of that is that ecig puffs (of 16 mg liquid, etc etc etc) delivers 1/7 as much nicotine as do real cigarettes.  Unfortunately, the graph on the first page shows that real cigarettes deliver between ~5 and 13 times as much nicotine per puff as a real cigarette.  Am I misreading that, or is the study internally inconsistent?  Goddammit, I had high hopes for this one...",®

t5_2sfg5,400921FB54442D18,1366237816,"Three things here.  One: *In addition* to ""PC"" being an acronym for ""Personal Computer"" and ""Mac"" being an abbreviation of ""Macintosh,"" they are *also* the widely-accepted terms for two of the largest *platforms* – a platform being a typical combination of hardware and software. You could, for example, buy an IBM (brand) PC, XT, or AT (model names) and load DR-DOS (operating system) on it, and say you had a ""DOS machine,"" and while that wouldn't specify a particular piece of hardware or software, it would give you a pretty good idea of the capabilities and level of sophistication of what you had. As it just so happens, these two platforms have been called ""PC"" and ""Mac"" by many of their adherents since the early 1990's (or maybe before), and as a result, asking someone if their computer is a ""PC"" or ""Mac"" is perfectly acceptable correct usage, just like it's acceptable to hand someone a box of Puffs™ Facial Tissues if they ask me for a ""Kleenex."" If you're a developer, think of them as overloaded identifiers. To say these terms are ""inane"" because they don't adhere their original dictionary definitions is like King Canute trying to order back the tides. Language grows; get used to it.  Secondly, there are enough clueless users out there who already have a hard enough time telling the difference between Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and any other software. How many times have you heard someone ask ""What's your web browser?"" and the user says ""Windows!""? Or someone asks ""What operating system are you running?"" and the user answers ""Firefox!""? We don't need to be confusing these people any more than they already are by asking them to understand the difference between ""Windows"" (a piece of software) in the sentence ""Have you installed Windows?"" and ""Windows"" (a platform including hardware) in the sentence ""Is it Windows or Mac?"" (Plus, technically, a Mac doesn't run any software with ""Mac"" or ""Macintosh"" in the name any longer, so saying ""is it Windows or Mac"" is actually *less* internally consistent than saying ""PC or Mac."") Calling the computers ""PCs"" and ""Macs"" is an extremely useful shorthand when dealing with consumer-grade users, and why would we get rid of a convention that *increases* comprehension in favor of one that *decreases* it?  Lastly, and least importantly, to say that modern Windows-running computers are ""only tenuously related"" to the IBM PC / AT / XT is like saying I'm only tenuously related to my great-grandfather. Sure, only 1/8th of my genes are from him, but when you can trace a direct line of descent (or inspiration, or technological evolution) from one thing to another, most people would not call that relation ""tenuous.""",™

t5_2u489,yurnotsoeviltwin,1366266583,"I would make a bit of a distinction between essential doctrine for Christianity and essential belief for a Christian. I agree with you that it is essential for Christian doctrine that the physical resurrection is true. If Christ hadn't risen, there would be no resurrection of the dead, and we would still be in our sins. **But** he *has* risen, and he has invited us to be in fellowship with him and serve him. That invitation is not an invitation to cognitive assent to a series of propositions. It precedes understanding.  I know you're imagining someone who can't let go of a reductionist paradigm, but imagine for a moment a person with a severe mental disability. This person is stuck in perpetual early childhood, to the point where they don't comprehend death, much less resurrection. Still, they know who Jesus is, and they know that He's the boss, not them. So they submit, as best they can, to his lordship—trying to act unselfishly, including rather than excluding, all that jazz. I think that person is very much a True Christian™, despite their lack of understanding.   What about the person who's fully mentally capable but just can't wrap their head around life after death? If they come before God with a humble and submissive heart... I think God can work with that. It's not the end of the journey by any means, but it's enough to start the journey toward sanctification.",™

All it's saying is you can digest protein better if you take aminogen, a commercial digestive aid, without reading the full article i cant comment on the exact numbers, but that study (the only real science referenced) was not investigating how much protein can be maximally absorbed (I.e. by a person whose body is in a state where they require much protein:  &gt;None of the participants were following any particular protein-rich dietary regime, muscle-toning or bodybuilding program during the study.

t5_2wqgc,BovingdonBug,1366295481,"Before anyone complains that this isn't technically a Game Tale™, I'd like to think one of the principles of this place is to encourage and help people to try out obscure, or not easily accessible games that they may not have previously considered.  I would suggest that this sort of post is fine, as long as:  * They don't start to outnumber actual stories * The stories are all clearly labelled with the game name, so people can avoid non-story posts.  (Maybe we should decide on a label for non-stories?)  If anyone has strong feelings to the contrary, and would rather only allow stories here, I'm more than willing to listen to your arguments.",™

t5_2snuc,culpepper,1366304232,"""The unicorn is a legendary animal from European folklore that resembles a white horse with a large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead, and sometimes a goat's beard and cloven hooves.""Should I have mentioned the beard??? 😊My whole comment was more in line with the slight playfulness of u/icanseestars' comment.As far as a unicorn isn't just a horse with a horn... Supernatural abilities aside, I think that if an paleontologist dug up a horse with horn coming out of it's head, people would call it a unicorn, regardless of whether some myth says it should cure poisonous water or whatever.Fairies are just another entity that some people bring up to challenge someone's agnosticism. I didn't intentionally mean to avoid them, I thought my meaning and intent was clear given the context. Sorry for any miscommunication. 😊",😊

t5_2qqqf,vicariouslyeye,1366312658,"&gt;It's a shame people have defensively downvoted you. We shouldn't discourage debate.  I really anticipated as much, and I am actually somewhat delighted that it didn't go worse. I understand the downvotes, and almost think I half deserve the defensive response as I stand from a point of bias--I haven't been through what several others have been through, and assuming the true nature of their situation comes off poorly by default. Like you said, it can be a chemical thing. But I also think that most of the chemical occurrences were symbiotic in origin. The indoctrination is such a massive part of how people consider things legitimate! Again, I just couldn't help but post this because of how necessary of a conversation I truly think it is. I have noticed that as generations become more and more raised by technology and outside stimulation, they are less and less aware of how to independently stimulate themselves and more hinged on the idea that their life will become what is on the screen without any effort (as the stimulation itself also never required effort). Many hope that the programming of their life will be remanaged like the programming on the screen, without their own help. I even find myself with this mentality at times, hence my ability to believe it is actually a common problem of perspective.   &gt;We are often scared to break away from the architecture of our society.  Amen! Paradigm attachment is (IMHO) the single most paramount cause of information stagnation and overall poor physical and mental health globally. It is this sort of thing that causes us to spend decades thinking that cigarettes are nutritious, or that 20s coca cola eases you just cuz its such a darn good drink.  I do think that most versions of ""growing up"" involve losing parts of your soul...indeed sometimes retaining the soul means enduring your being ostrasized and ridiculed...becoming a renegade who thrives on true interaction and self-satisfcation, the ability to find contentment in an absurd journey.   The thoughts were very coherent and appreciated ♥",♥

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1366312936,"&gt;###Developer Update: Bounty Hunter Class Changes - 04.18.2013  &gt;Hello everyone. My name is Austin Peckenpaugh, and I’m a Senior Designer on Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, responsible for class design and combat systems. As such, I’m here to shed some light on the changes to the Bounty Hunter class in Game Update 2.0.  &gt;We’ll be writing about recent class changes coming to The Old Republic, but this time we’re going a little more in depth and taking on one class (for both factions) at a time. If we haven’t covered your class yet, do not despair; it will be covered in the coming days.  &gt;##Combat Systems  &gt;**Alacrity Improvements:** One of the big changes to combat systems is the way that Alacrity works. Prior to this update, Alacrity came with a tradeoff for some classes, and it was nearly useless to other classes. The faster you attacked, the more resources you would spend, and that only worked if you had channeled abilities or abilities with activation times.  &gt;Now, Alacrity will increase the activation speed of all abilities, including instants. We haven’t just shortened the global cooldown, either. When activating any ability quicker, its animation will also play quicker. This makes some attacks look and sound very cool. Furthermore, Alacrity increases resource regeneration by the same rate, helping you to recuperate resources more quickly as you spend them more quickly. Now more Alacrity is strictly a good thing.  &gt;**DoT Improvements:** We’ve changed the way we evaluate damage over time effects, so it should now be less costly to keep your DoTs up and to spread them around.  &gt;**Shield Improvements:** We’ve changed the way shields work to allow them to absorb any incoming kinetic or energy damage regardless of the source (melee, ranged, Force, tech – doesn’t matter). This has significantly increased the importance of shields, and the game has been rebalanced to account for such a major adjustment.  &gt;**Accuracy Matters:** In 2.0, all Elite (gold star) and tougher enemies will have additional defense chances against Force and tech attacks. As a result, Accuracy Rating will play a pivotal role in optimizing your sustained damage in boss fights. Prior to 2.0, Accuracy Rating was valued very differently from class to class (or even spec to spec), and while it’s still different for each class or spec, that difference is now much smaller. In effect, all damage-dealing roles will find Accuracy Rating much more useful than before.  &gt;##Bounty Hunter  &gt;* **Hydraulic Overrides for Everyone!:** Hydraulic Overrides is now trainable at level 26 for all Bounty Hunters. This ability grants immunity to slows, immobilizes, and knockbacks and increases movement speed by 30%. Lasts 6 seconds. * **Chaff Flare for Everyone!:** Chaff Flare is now trainable at level 30 for all Bounty Hunters. This ability reduces the Bounty Hunter’s threat to all enemies that he or she is currently engaged in combat with. * **New Kolto Overload:** Kolto Overload has been redesigned. We want this ability to be a powerful survivability tool and give Bounty Hunters something totally unique. The previous Kolto Overload just wasn’t doing it, so we’ve changed it. Now when you use this ability, you gain a Health Monitor for 1 minute. While Health Monitor is active, when your health is reduced to 30% or less, Health Monitor is replaced by Kolto Overload, which rapidly heals you up to 30% health but will not heal you above 30% health. Once Kolto Overload is triggered, you become very difficult to kill for its duration. The Kolto Overload healing effect lasts 8 seconds once triggered.  &gt;##Mercenary  &gt;We have a few simple goals for Mercenaries in 2.0. From a PVE perspective, we want to ensure their rotations are fun and effective. Beyond rotations, we want Mercenaries to have better group support and self survivability. These goals translate into PVP as well, where we also want Mercenaries to be more mobile and have better utility. In short, we’ve heard your complaints, and there are a lot of new goodies in store for Mercenaries.  &gt;* **Kolto Missile for All Mercenaries!:** This ability is now trainable for all Mercenaries at level 20. Kolto Missile is no longer restricted to the Bodyguard skill tree (although Bodyguards can improve it with unique skills). * **Missile Salvo:** This is a new passive ability gained at level 10 upon becoming a Mercenary. When Mercenaries fire Missile Blast, two missiles are fired for a combined increase in damage. This increase in damage is not enough to make Missile Blast alter anyone’s rotation, but it will now serve as a much more effective on-the-run utility skill. Also, double knockdown against weak and standard enemies is neat. * **Power Shot:** This ability now has a 1.5-second activation speed. * **High Velocity Gas Cylinder:** Now additionally increases Alacrity by 3% while active. * **Combustible Gas Cylinder:** Now deals less damage but has a higher chance to be triggered. * **Electro Net (New ability):** Electro Net is a powerful new ability that slows and shocks the target for energy damage over time. Additionally, Electro Net grows more powerful over time. Player targets can avoid Electro Net’s increasing damage by holding still and refraining from movement (although it’s still safe to attack without triggering this effect). Finally, Electro Net applies a brand new debuff effect to the target called Hindered. While Hindered, the target cannot use high mobility actions and escapes such as charges, vanishes, and speed boosts. Capturing a target in an Electro Net effectively turns it into a sitting duck.  &gt;Below are some additional details on changes made to the Mercenary’s skill trees. Many more skills than the ones mentioned here have changed; these are really just the highlights.  &gt;***Bodyguard***  &gt;Our intentions with the Bodyguard skill tree fall in-line with our overarching goals for the Mercenary. Bodyguards get cool new utility, a better arsenal of healing abilities for different situations, and some improvements to existing abilities.  &gt;* **Kolto Pods:** This new skill causes your Kolto Missile to deploy a pool of kolto over the target area, healing allies that remain within. * **Kolto Jets:** This new skill causes your Jet Boost to also heal yourself and all affected allies within range when triggered. * **Bodyguard:** This new skill greatly improves Kolto Shell by increasing the amount it heals, increasing its max number of charges, and reducing the rate limit by which it can heal the target.  &gt;***Arsenal***  &gt;In addition to great new baseline abilities, Arsenal now has less reliance on setup, better mobility, and better on-the-run utility.  &gt;* **Tracer Missile:** This ability now has a 1.5-second activation speed. Furthermore, the Heat Signature applied by Tracer Missile no longer stacks, reducing the target’s armor by 20% all at once. Also now lasts 45 seconds. * **Heatseeker Missiles:** This ability now packs an even bigger punch than before. Damage has been increased by approximately 15%. In addition, Heatseeker Missile now simply deals 25% additional damage when striking a target affected by your Heat Signature. Heatseeker Missiles’s projectile speed has been slowed slightly to ensure that it properly benefits from your Heat Signature if fired immediately after a Tracer Missile. * **Torque Boosters:** This new utility skill increases the duration of Hydraulic Overrides by 4 seconds, giving it a total duration of 10 seconds. * **Decoy:** With this new utility skill, your Chaff Flares intercept and completely absorbs the next immediate incoming Force or tech attack. Lasts 6 seconds. * **Power Overrides:** This skill now reduces the cooldown of Power Surge and Concussion Missile. In addition, Power Surge now makes your next two abilities activate instantly. * **Energy Rebounder:** This skill has been moved into the Arsenal skill tree from the Pyrotech skill tree. Now this skill reduces the active cooldown of Energy Shield when taking damage. In addition, when taking damage, you have a chance to deploy an Energy Redoubt, which absorbs a small amount of incoming damage. Lasts 6 seconds and cannot occur more than once every 10 seconds. * **Power Launcher:** This new skill increases the damage dealt by Rail Shot, Tracer Missile, Heatseeker Missiles, and  Electro Net.  &gt;***Pyrotech (Mercenary)***  &gt;* **Thermal Detonator:** Now when Thermal Detonator explodes, the target is set on fire for the next 12 seconds. * **Firebug:** This skill now increases the critical damage dealt by Combustible Gas Cylinder, Rail Shot, Power Shot, Incendiary Missile, and Thermal Detonator. * **Pyro Shield:** With this new utility skill, activating your Energy Shield additionally deploys a Pyro Shield. When attacked, Pyro Shield retaliates by lashing attackers with a significant amount of elemental damage. * **Volatile Warhead:** Reduces the cost of Missile Blast and makes your second Missile Blast in your Missile Salvo trigger your Combustible Gas Cylinder. * **Suit FOE:** With this new utility skill, activating Cure triggers an onboard Foreign Object Excisor, which reduces all periodic damage taken by 30% for the next 6 seconds. This effect only triggers when activating Cure on yourself. * **Jet Rebounder:** With this new utility skill, getting attacked reduces the active cooldown of Jet Boost.

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1366313299,"&gt;###Developer Update: Trooper Class Changes - 04.18.2013   &gt;Hello everyone. My name is Austin Peckenpaugh, and I’m a Senior Designer on Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, responsible for class design and combat systems. As such, I’m here to shed some light on the changes to the Trooper class in Game Update 2.0.  &gt;We’ll be writing about recent class changes coming to The Old Republic, but this time we’re going a little more in depth and taking on one class (for both factions) at a time. If we haven’t covered your class yet, do not despair; it will be covered in the coming days.  &gt;##Combat Systems  &gt;**Alacrity Improvements**: One of the big changes to combat systems is the way that Alacrity works. Prior to this update, Alacrity came with a tradeoff for some classes, and it was nearly useless to other classes. The faster you attacked, the more resources you would spend, and that only worked if you had channeled abilities or abilities with activation times.  &gt;Now, Alacrity will increase the activation speed of all abilities, including instants. We haven’t just shortened the global cooldown, either. When activating any ability quicker, its animation will also play quicker. This makes some attacks look and sound very cool. Furthermore, Alacrity increases resource regeneration by the same rate, helping you to recuperate resources more quickly as you spend them more quickly. Now more Alacrity is strictly a good thing.  &gt;**DoT Improvements**: We’ve changed the way we evaluate damage over time effects, so it should now be less costly to keep your DoTs up and to spread them around.  &gt;**Shield Improvements**: We’ve changed the way shields work to allow them to absorb any incoming kinetic or energy damage regardless of the source (melee, ranged, Force, tech – doesn’t matter). This has significantly increased the importance of shields, and the game has been rebalanced to account for such a major adjustment.  &gt;Accuracy Matters: In 2.0, all Elite (gold star) and tougher enemies will have additional defense chances against Force and tech attacks. As a result, Accuracy Rating will play a pivotal role in optimizing your sustained damage in boss fights. Prior to 2.0, Accuracy Rating was valued very differently from class to class (or even spec to spec), and while it’s still different for each class or spec, that difference is now much smaller. In effect, all damage-dealing roles will find Accuracy Rating much more useful than before.  &gt;##Trooper  &gt;A big “behind the scenes” change for Troopers in 2.0 is the new resource system, which effectively puts Troopers on the same “energy system” as Bounty Hunters. Prior to 2.0, the Trooper’s resources functioned similarly to and effectively emulated the Bounty Hunter’s heat, mechanically speaking, but they were functionally quite different. Now in 2.0, the Trooper’s energy cells are on a 100-point scale instead of a 12-point scale. You will notice that your abilities have new, higher costs, but do not despair – they are proportionately the same as before!  &gt;What this new system has done (aside from making development on the Trooper a lot simpler for us) is to finally put the Trooper and Bounty Hunter on the same scale, affording both classes the same level of granularity. Hopefully you won’t notice a difference as players, but the new system will require Trooper players to think of their resource costs on a different scale.  &gt;* **Hold the Line for Everyone!:** Hold the Line is now trainable at level 26 for all Troopers. This ability grants immunity to slows, immobilizes, and knockbacks and increases movement speed by 30%. Lasts 6 seconds. * **Diversion for Everyone!:** Diversion is now trainable at level 30 for all Troopers. This ability reduces the Trooper’s threat to all enemies that he or she is currently engaged in combat with. * **New Adrenaline Rush:** Adrenaline Rush has been redesigned. We want this ability to be a powerful survivability tool and give Troopers something totally unique. The previous Adrenaline Rush just wasn’t doing it, so we’ve changed it. Now when you use this ability, you get Fired Up for 1 minute. While Fired Up is active, when your health is reduced to 30% or less, Fired Up is replaced by Adrenaline Rush, which rapidly heals you up to 30% health but will not heal you above 30% health. Once Adrenaline Rush is triggered, you become very difficult to kill for its duration. The Adrenaline Rush healing effect lasts 8 seconds once triggered.  &gt;##Commando  &gt;We have a few simple goals for Commandos in 2.0. From a PVE perspective, we want to ensure their rotations are fun and effective. Beyond rotations, we want Commandos to have better group support and self survivability. These goals translate into PVP as well, where we also want Commandos to be more mobile and have better utility. In short, we’ve heard your complaints, and there are a lot of new goodies in store for Commandos.  &gt;* **Kolto Bomb for All Commandos!:** This ability is now trainable for all Commandos at level 20. Kolto Bomb is no longer restricted to the Combat Medic skill tree (although Combat Medics can improve it with unique skills). * **Mortar Salvo:** This is a new passive ability gained at level 10 upon becoming a Commando. When Commandos fire Explosive Round, two rounds are fired for a combined increase in damage. This increase in damage is not enough to make Explosive Round alter anyone’s rotation, but it will now serve as a much more effective on-the-run utility skill. Also, double knockdown against weak and standard enemies is neat. * **Charged Bolts:** This ability now has a 1.5-second activation speed. * **Armor Piercing Cell:** Now additionally increases Alacrity by 3% while active. * **Plasma Cell:** Now deals less damage but has a higher chance to be triggered. * **Electro Net (New ability):** Electro Net is a powerful new ability that slows and shocks the target for energy damage over time. Additionally, Electro Net grows more powerful over time. Player targets can avoid Electro Net’s increasing damage by holding still and refraining from movement (although it’s still safe to attack without triggering this effect). Finally, Electro Net applies a brand new debuff effect to the target called Hindered. While Hindered, the target cannot use high mobility actions and escapes such as charges, vanishes, and speed boosts. Capturing a target in an Electro Net effectively turns it into a sitting duck.  &gt;Below are some additional details on changes made to the Commando’s skill trees. Many more skills than the ones mentioned here have changed; these are really just the highlights.  &gt;***Combat Medic***  &gt;Our intentions with the Combat Medic skill tree fall in-line with our overarching goals for the Commando. Combat Medics get cool new utility, a better arsenal of healing abilities for different situations, and some improvements to existing abilities.  &gt;* **Kolto Pods:** This new skill causes your Kolto Bomb to deploy a pool of kolto over the target area, healing allies that remain within. * **Kolto Wave:** This new skill causes your Concussion Charge to also heal yourself and all affected allies within range when triggered. * **Probe Medic:** This new skill greatly improves Trauma Probe by increasing the amount it heals, increasing its max number of charges, and reducing the rate limit by which it can heal the target.  &gt;***Gunnery***  &gt;In addition to great new baseline abilities, Gunnery now has less reliance on setup, better mobility, and better on-the-run utility.  &gt;* **Grav Round:** This ability now has a 1.5-second activation speed. Furthermore, the Gravity Vortex applied by Grav Round no longer stacks, reducing the target’s armor by 20% all at once. Also now lasts 45 seconds. * **Demolition Round:** This ability now packs an even bigger punch than before. Damage has been increased by approximately 15%. In addition, Demolition Round now simply deals 25% additional damage when striking a target affected by your Gravity Vortex. Demolition Round’s projectile speed has been slowed slightly to ensure that it properly benefits from your Gravity Vortex if fired immediately after a Grav Round. * **Advance the Line:** This new utility skill increases the duration of Hold the Line by 4 seconds, giving it a total duration of 10 seconds. * **Decoy:** With this new utility skill, your Diversion intercepts and completely absorbs the next immediate incoming Force or tech attack. Lasts 6 seconds. * **Overclock:** This skill now reduces the cooldown of Tech Override and Concussive Round. In addition, Tech Override now makes your next two abilities activate instantly. * **Reflexive Shield:** This skill has been moved into the Gunnery skill tree from the Assault Specialist skill tree. Now this skill reduces the active cooldown of Reactive Shield when taking damage. In addition, when taking damage, you have a chance to deploy an Energy Redoubt, which absorbs a small amount of incoming damage. Lasts 6 seconds and cannot occur more than once every 10 seconds. * **Charged Launcher:** This new skill increases the damage dealt by High Impact Bolt, Grav Round, Demolition Round, and Electro Net.",™

t5_2cneq,open_ur_mind,1366327891,"John Kass April 18, 2013  &gt;Here's an idea for CNN, Fox News and all the other TV news shops running those ominous crawl lines under their breathless broadcasts of the Boston Marathon bombings.  &gt;I'm talking about those infuriating headlines that crawl across the bottom of the screen and tease upcoming news. Some networks run icy white letters in their crawls. Fox runs yellow letters, the color of warning. But I was watching CNN on Wednesday. And that network delivers its crawl on a bed of blazing, ill-omened red.    &gt;So here's the plan. Instead of running crawls that drip with menacing crimson imperative, maybe CNN should try something like this when there's nothing new to report about what happened in Boston:  &gt;... WE WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED, BUT GUESS WHAT? ... WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET. … WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS. …  &gt;… WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IF THE BOMBER IS A DARK-SKINNED MALE. … YEAH, WE SAID IT ON THE AIR … BUT, WHAT THE HECK? … IT COULD BE A WHITE MAN. … SOME GUY TOLD US ABOUT 'THE DARK-SKINNED MALE' AND, WELL, OOPS … OUR BAD.  &gt;… FOR NOW, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. … REPEAT ... WE JUST DON'T KNOW. … WHEN WE DO HAVE FACTS … WHEN WE KNOW … WE'LL TELL YOU … REALLY. … UNTIL THEN … WE JUST DON'T KNOW … WE JUST DON'T … KNOW.  &gt;Wouldn't it be nice? It would be refreshing. There's a certain truthiness about it, no?  &gt;I can't speak for the TV networks. I'm a newspaperman. And newspaper editors love it when reporters bring them hot news. Yet there are eight little words that the best newspaper editors also like:  &gt;I just don't know. But I'll find out.  &gt;Those words aren't easy to say, especially when there's a big story and the competition is boiling like a piranha tank. And in the news business lately, with all the changes going on, such as integration with the Internet and video and tweets and 24-hour news cycles, it seems that we're not only competing against credible and incredible news shops, it seems that we're fighting for our lives.  &gt;So with that pressure, it's difficult to say, ""I just don't know.""  &gt;Sometimes young reporters think they've failed when they say it. But I've seen editors, the good ones, give each other a look when they hear it. And in that look, they're making a mental note that says: I just might be able to trust this kid.  &gt;Picking on TV news shops may be seen by some as cruel, like picking the wings off flies. Mistakes happen. I know it. I've made my share.  &gt;But the Boston bombings were horrific. The death and the carnage were horrific. People want to know what happened. And rushing to blurt out inaccurate information because the other guys may have something juicy is disreputable. It's worthy of a Moutza.  &gt;Watching TV news during the day is something I rarely do, because I'm usually out reporting or having lunch or sitting in my office reading deep journals about baseball or soccer. If the office TV is on, it usually shows highly paid men kicking, hitting, dribbling or running with a ball. Or fishing. Sometimes I'll watch CBS' ""The Good Wife,"" my columnist resource for deep legal and political insight and attractive women of a certain age in great suits.  &gt;Mostly, though, the office TV is off.  &gt;But I happened to be home at midday and turned on the tube to check the Boston bombing story. What bothered me was the volume. The newscasters' voices were loud and full of freaky urgency. In addition to erroneously reporting an arrest, CNN also made the misjudgment of focusing on the alleged skin color of the alleged suspect.  &gt;""I want to be very careful about this because people get very sensitive when you say these things,"" said CNN's John King during a report. ""I was told by one of these sources, who is a law enforcement official, that this was a dark-skinned male. The official used some other words, I'm not going to repeat them until we get more information because of the sensitivities. There are some people that will take offense even at saying that.""  &gt;But there was no arrest. And what does skin have to do with it?  &gt;CNN wasn't the only violator. Fox said there was an arrest and also had to back off.  &gt;We pundits aren't exempt either. Those representing the political left and the right have been circling this story, too, with some on the left clearly hoping the suspects turn out to be anti-tax libertarians, and some on the right hoping the suspects turn out to be foreign extremists. Each side is ready to pounce. David Axelrod, the president's political brain, offers us an example of the technique.  &gt;""I'm sure what was going through the president's mind is — we really don't know who did this. It was Tax Day. Is it someone who was pro- …"" said Axelrod on MSNBC, stopping at the edge. ""You just don't know. And so, I think, his attitude is: Let's not put any inference into this. Let's just make clear that we're going to get the people responsible.""  &gt;That was expertly and deliciously done — Axelrod dropping the inference about those opposed to tax increases, then admonishing those who'd infer anything until we know the facts. And such is the craft of a master.  &gt;But back to CNN. After doing the dark-skinned man report, they truly should reform themselves and offer a new series of crawls:  &gt;... WHEN FACTS COME IN, WE'LL SAY SOMETHING. … DON'T WORRY. … FACTS WILL COME … REALLY THEY WILL. … BUT FOR NOW, WE JUST DON'T KNOW.  jskass@tribune.com  Twitter @John_Kass  Copyright © 2013 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC",©

I even went out and bought Sim City *after* I saw some of the hate, thinking it was the Reddit Hate™ bandwagon. I purchased the game, and loved every second of it. The graphics were brilliant, and each new city was like the start of a new book.  But then I got into it. After the first week the gameplay went downhill faster than a George Lucas love story. I put it down and haven't had the urge to pick it back up. This is without a single rollback or really nasty bug that people seem to get. The game just sucked.  I'd request a refund, but I bought a boxed copy from a retail store, and I'm pretty sure that would eat into the store's profit rather than EA's. If I count my playtime in beers, it's cheaper than going out. But the game really sucked.  Also, I'm down voting you for implying that anyone who thinks the game sucks has autism.",™
t5_2rdi4,zifyoip,1366341857,"I think what he was trying to say is that your overall expression is probably going to look like A(P,Q)→B(P,Q), where A(P,Q) and B(P,Q) are themselves expressions with P's and Q's in them.  To see this, imagine that you have this big expression written in terms of −&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;→, and you plug in a truth value for&amp;nbsp;P and another truth value for&amp;nbsp;Q, and you evaluate it. The very last operation you evaluate in the expression is probably going to be a&amp;nbsp;→, after you've evaluated the two sides of the&amp;nbsp;→ separately. (Either that or your last operation is going to be a&amp;nbsp;−.) If your last operation is a&amp;nbsp;→, then call the expression on the left side A(P,Q), whatever it is, and call the expression on the right side B(P,Q). Then your overall expression is going to be A(P,Q)→B(P,Q), right?  I think Anonoben's table was trying to make the point that your goal is to design the expressions A(P,Q) and B(P,Q) so that when you evaluate A(P,Q)→B(P,Q) the result is equivalent to P↔Q.  If that's the case, then you don't want to make A(P,Q) be P→Q and B(P,Q) be Q→P, because then the expression A(P,Q)→B(P,Q) is (P→Q)→(Q→P), which is not equivalent to P↔Q.",↔

Sometime in the 2000s the Simpsons staff eventually realized just not only how big the Simpsons are but how ingrained the hit show was into our society.  Because of this realization they simply stopped trying and just went for cheap cop outs with the mainstream references etc. They knew that no matter what, regardless of quality, people will always keep watching simply because it's the Simpsons™ and nothing more (oh the power of brand marketing). Literally their only worry these days the Simpsons staff had was keeping up with the status quo of episodes ordered by the Fox network.   If you look around everywhere in show business you can find countless other cases. Metallica is another good example.

t5_2qh0z,SomePostMan,1366356283,"Explanation for anyone who wants it:  Almost everything you learn in math, up to a point, is totally algorithmic... that is, once you've translated the words into math, the actual math part can be solved by one or more step-by-step process(es) you're taught. The only part where intuition and guesswork come in is for recognizing shortcuts, and recognizing which method (if multiple) will be easier, but intuition isn't needed. Then, all of a sudden, they drop integration on you.^(1) Many/most random-ass equations can't be successfully integrated,^(2) so there are a few rules for simple equations and, after that, it's like ""try this, and maybe if you cross your eyes hard enough, a solution will just pop out at you!"", and it's very frustrating to switch gears.  That's often the first step in gradual transition from algorithmic to intuitive methods in higher-level math, which drives out the people who can't do both. A lot of people love math in high school and then find out they [feel like they] can't do it in college and drop out because of this. Conversely, many of the people who would be really good at it decide they're bad at math before they get to college.  =  ^(1 Although, in my case, the earliest instance of that was factoring... I was taught the intuitive approaches for factoring before being taught the quadratic equation. I wish they'd been taught simultaneously or in reverse, because it would've shown why the approach suddenly switches.)  ^(2 analytically™)",™

Oh my fucking no~~gOD~~, I think I'm going to lose my shit!  **EDIT 2:** 1.12 PM GMT - Reddit came back. Whew, crisis averted  **EDIT 3:** 1.13 PM GMT - REDDIT IS DOWN, I REPEAT, REDDIT IS DOWN! IT'S CHAOS IN THE STREETS! EVERYBODY, STAY INSIDE, STAY SAFE!  **EDIT 4:** 1.20 PM GMT - Reddit is still not back up. I can see rioting and looting in the streets  **EDIT 5:** 1.32 PM GMT - Reddit came back up for a few minutes, then it went away again. I can't live like this, the uncertainty is killing me  **EDIT 6:** 1.38 PM GMT - Reddit is now more unstable than ever. Human relations have all but broken down, the entire downtown is now a smoking crater, there's wanton rape, murder and cannibalism.  **EDIT 7:** 1.52 PM GMT - Reddit is back up now. There's a nice picture of a kitty over on /r/aww  **EDIT 8:** 1.58 PM GMT - It's down again. I'm pretty sure this was the work of either competing corporate interests, Anonymous, Uncle Sam, or the terrorist themselves. We need to know who the enemy is.  **EDIT 9:** 2.12 PM GMT - I tried going to 9gag. There were no survivors  **EDIT 10:** 2.26 PM GMT - The worst has passed. I can only hope that this cataclysmic event brought us all closer together, and we can form a stronger community as a result. Stay safe out there, everybody!  **EDIT 11:** 19/4 NEVAR 4GET  **EDIT 12:** I think it's clear that we were under attack by CNN. Why else wouldn't they be reporting on Reddit being down for almost an hour and a half?! That's all the admission of guilt I need!  **EDIT 13:** 3.25 PM GMT - Reddit was down again for about 12 seconds. What can we do to make sure that this brazen assault on our rights and this attack on freedom of speech doesn't happen again?!   **EDIT 14:** 3.53 PM GMT - It's been almost 30 minutes without an incident, I think the worst is over. Let's all ~~pray~~concentrate for the safe return of our rights to privacy and free speech. Remember this day, a day that shall be remembered in ignominy, the date when Democracy died. The day when Reddit was down for an hour and a half.  **EDIT 15:** CISPA passed today. Reddit's founder was against CISPA. Reddit went down today. **COINCIDENCE?** I think not. It's clear **The Man** *hates* our freedom of speech, and **They** are doing everything **They** can to silence us and keep us obedient like nice little sheep. **WAKE UP, SHEEPLE!**  **EDIT 16:** You see? This is what happens when you offer an Always-Online service! It gets taken down, and then what do you do? Go play SimCity? What are you, some sort of Romney?  **EDIT 17:** 5.23 PM GMT - Nothing has happened in the past couple of hours. I think we're safe for now. **WE DID IT, REDDIT!** But we should also remain forever vigilant against those that would attack our freedoms and our independence and, dare I say, even our lives! Think about how our lives would be impacted if they took away our reddit! We are literally saving lives by posting on reddit, we are literally feeding the homeless and clothing the starving!  **EDIT 18:** 5.45 PM GMT: Hold your ground, hold your ground! Sons of Reddit, of the internet, my brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our freedom of speech and break all bonds of constitutional rights, but it is not this day. An hour of woes and shattered monitors, when the age of Internet Cutting Edge Journalism comes crashing down! But it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you *stand, Men of Reddit!*   **EDIT 19:** 6.17 PM GMT - Nothing continues to happen. It's tense, the atmosphere is tense beyond belief. We are entering hour 5 of Take No Prisoners™ journalism. There is an eerie quiet on what was once downtown Cranleigh in Surrey, the undisputed center of Journalistic Integrity. It's almost *too* peaceful. We try and gather ourselves together, the filthy, hungry, wounded and alone masses, but we are also hopeful that tomorrow will bring a new dawn, a day, a new life for all of us. The tears of the children of future generations will be shed for this day, The Day The World Stopped, as it will come to be known in the upcoming upheaval. We have been beaten, bruised and scarred, but we have not been defeated. We have showed The Oppressors that we will not stand for their manipulation!  **EDIT 20:** 6.22 PM GMT - My work day is over, I'm going out for a pint.

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1366391387,"&gt;###Developer Update: Jedi Consular Class Changes - 04.19.2013  &gt;Hello everyone. My name is Austin Peckenpaugh, and I’m a Senior Designer on Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, responsible for class design and combat systems. As such, I’m here to shed some light on the changes to the Jedi Consular class in Game Update 2.0.  &gt;We’ll be writing about recent class changes coming to The Old Republic, but this time we’re going a little more in depth and taking on one class (for both factions) at a time.  &gt;##Combat Systems  &gt;**Alacrity Improvements:** One of the big changes to combat systems is the way that Alacrity works. Prior to this update, Alacrity came with a tradeoff for some classes, and it was nearly useless to other classes. The faster you attacked, the more resources you would spend, and that only worked if you had channeled abilities or abilities with activation times.  &gt;Now, Alacrity will increase the activation speed of all abilities, including instants. We haven’t just shortened the global cooldown, either. When activating any ability quicker, its animation will also play quicker. This makes some attacks look and sound very cool. Furthermore, Alacrity increases resource regeneration by the same rate, helping you to recuperate resources more quickly as you spend them more quickly. Now more Alacrity is strictly a good thing.  &gt;**DoT Improvements:** We’ve changed the way we evaluate damage over time effects, so it should now be less costly to keep your DoTs up and to spread them around.  &gt;**Shield Improvements:** We’ve changed the way shields work to allow them to absorb any incoming kinetic or energy damage regardless of the source (melee, ranged, Force, tech – doesn’t matter). This has significantly increased the importance of shields, and the game has been rebalanced to account for such a major adjustment.  &gt;**Accuracy Matters:** In 2.0, all Elite (gold star) and tougher enemies will have additional defense chances against Force and tech attacks. As a result, Accuracy Rating will play a pivotal role in optimizing your sustained damage in boss fights. Prior to 2.0, Accuracy Rating was valued very differently from class to class (or even spec to spec), and while it’s still different for each class or spec, that difference is now much smaller. In effect, all damage-dealing roles will find Accuracy Rating much more useful than before.  &gt;##Sage  &gt;* **Better Benevolence:** Previously the difference between Benevolence and Deliverance wasn’t as obvious or meaningful as we’d have liked. Now, Benevolence costs 70 Force and heals for significantly more. Benevolence should be a better resort when time and immediacy are of the essence, and Deliverance should be a better resort when Force-conservation is of the essence. Consequently, parts of the game where Force efficiency is less important, Benevolence is just a better heal. This makes Benevolence better for soloing and off-healing in Flashpoints and Warzones. * **Better Force Armor:** We’ve removed the cooldown from Force Armor so that it’s easier to protect your allies even when not spec’d in the Seer skill tree. It still has its Force-imbalanced debuff lockout of course. * **Baseline Mental Alacrity:** Mental Alacrity is now available for all Sages! All Sages can now benefit from 10 seconds of 20% Alacrity and immunity to interrupts. * **Force Barrier (New ability):** This ability grants total immunity to all hostile effects and damage while channeled. Force Barrier can be channeled up to 10 seconds, but like any other channeled ability, you can cancel it or move out of it at any time. While channeled, incoming damage and debuffs will fail to apply.  &gt;Below are some additional details on changes made to the Sage’s skill trees. Many more skills than the ones mentioned here have changed; these are really just the highlights.  &gt;***Seer***  &gt;Prior to 2.0, Seer didn’t have much in the way of unique utility. In fact, many Seer Sages forwent their high tier skills to pick up some of Telekinetics’s utility. This is usually a sign that things in your main skill tree aren’t attractive enough, so we set out to address that.  &gt;* **Psychic Suffusion:** This skill has been completely redesigned. Now this skill causes your Force Wave to heal all affected allies for a moderate amount. * **Life Ward:** While your own Force Armor or Force Barrier is active on yourself, you heal for a percent of your maximum health. In addition to increased survivability, this skill should help reduce the impact of managing your Force with Noble Sacrifice. * **Master Speed:** This new utility skill increases the duration of your Force Speed and finishes the cooldown on Force Speed when Force Barrier ends. This gives you the means to a quick getaway after using Force Barrier. When coupled with the existing Egress skill, you should be harder than ever to pin down. * **Resplendence:** This skill has been redesigned. Now Healing Trance critical hits grant 1 charge of Resplendence. Each charge can be spent on Noble Sacrifice as before to make Noble Sacrifice not degenerate your Force. You can now have up to 3 charges of Resplendence. Furthermore, each charge of Resplendence reduces the activation time of your next Salvation by 33.34%, such that Salvation becomes instant when spending 3 charges of Resplendence on it.  &gt;***Telekinetics***  &gt;Telekinetics has gotten a few major changes in 2.0 that should improve their gameplay considerably. However, we’ve also made considerations for how Telekinetics affects the rest of the game (other player’s gameplay) through Kinetic Collapse.  &gt;* **Fixed Kinetic Collapse:** This effect now only triggers when a Force Armor you put on yourself ends. Placing Force Armor on an ally will not trigger the Kinetic Collapse effect when that Force Armor ends. Furthermore, Kinetic Collapse’s control effect now breaks from direct damage. Although this change has been a long time coming, we wanted to make sure we didn’t undermine the group support role Kinetic Collapse had been providing Telekinetics. To offset this change, we’ve made further changes to Telekinetics and Sages to help facilitate a strong support role.     * **Cascading Force:** This new utility skill causes Telekinetic Wave to slow and briefly immobilize all affected targets. With the increased chance of triggering Tidal Force, Telekinetic Wave (and subsequently this effect) will be available very often.     * **Benevolence:** As previously mentioned, Benevolence now heals for significantly more. All Sages should have better spot healing or off-healing capabilities.     * **Force Armor:** As previously mentioned, Force Armor no longer has a cooldown, making it easier to protect more allies. * **More Tidal Force:** This skill’s proc chance has been significantly increased, and Turbulence now has a chance to trigger Tidal Force for better full tree synergy. * **Tremors:** Each time this skill is triggered and stacks, the active cooldown of Mental Alacrity is reduced. * **Flowing Force:** This new skill increases the chance that Telekinetic Momentum will trigger while Mental Alacrity is active. It additionally reduces the cooldown of Mental Alacrity and increases its duration. * **Force Haste:** This new utility skill reduces the cooldowns of Force Speed, Force Slow, and Force Barrier. * **Reverberation:** This is now a 2-pt skill instead of a 5-pt skill. Its total effectiveness has not been changed. This change frees up more skill points for more utility. * **Mental Momentum:** This new skill gives Mind Crush a chance to tick twice and Turbulence a chance to produce a second blast, similar to Telekinetic Momentum.  &gt;***Balance (Sage)***  &gt;* **Drain Thoughts:** Now affects all periodic damage dealt so that Sever Force better synergizes with the skill tree. * **Force Suppression:** Now applies 15 charges instead of 10. * **Force In Balance:** Now affects up to 5 targets instead of 3. * **Presence of Mind:** Now when this effect procs, the damage dealt by your next Mind Crush or Disturbance is increased by 35% (up from 20%). * **Containment:** The activation time reduction on Force Lift has been reduced in effectiveness. Previously, this skill gave Balance a lot of extra lockdown that we weren’t too pleased with, and after the introduction of Force Barrier, Balance’s ability to flee and avoid conflict exceeded acceptable levels. Now this skill reduces the activation time of Force Lift to 1.5 seconds. The stun effect when Force Lift ends prematurely due to damage has not been altered. * **Rippling Force:** With this new skill, when your Telekinetic Throw or Disturbance deals damage, it has a chance to deal additional kinetic damage after 1 second. Damage dealt by these Force Ripples restores 2 Force (with max points). * **Telekinetic Focal Point:** This new skill gives Telekinetic Throw and Disturbance a chance to build stacks of Telekinetic Focal Point, which increases Alacrity by 1%. Stacks up to 4 times. * **Mental Defense:** This new utility skill reduces all damage taken by 30% while stunned. Balance has a good deal of self healing through effects like Focused Insight and Force In Balance, but this healing isn’t on-demand and can’t counter burst at key moments. As a result, Balance is especially vulnerable to being bursted down while controlled, so we added Mental Defense to help Balance’s survivability in that department.  &gt;##Shadow  &gt;* **Electrostaves:** Key abilities like Double Strike, Clairvoyant Strike, and Shadow Strike can now be used with an electrostaff! * **Force Breach:** This ability no longer has a cooldown for Force Technique or Shadow Technique. Using Force Breach with Combat Technique active now issues a 6-second cooldown. Combat Technique’s accuracy reduction effect from Force Breach now lasts 30 seconds.",™

Dark Heal should be a better resort when time and immediacy are of the essence, and Dark Infusion should be a better resort when Force-conservation is of the essence.

This makes Dark Heal better for soloing and off-healing in Flashpoints and Warzones. * **Better Static Barrier:** We’ve removed the cooldown from Static Barrier so that it’s easier to protect your allies even when not spec’d in the Corruption skill tree. It still has its Deionized debuff lockout of course. * **Baseline Polarity Shift:** Polarity Shift is now available for all Sorcerers!

In fact, many Corruption Sorcerers forwent their high tier skills to pick up some of Lightning’s utility. This is usually a sign that things in your main skill tree aren’t attractive enough, so we set out to address that.  &gt;* **Force Suffusion:** This skill has been completely redesigned. Now this skill causes your Overload to heal all affected allies for a moderate amount. * **Corrupted Barrier:** While your own Static Barrier or Force Barrier is active on yourself, you heal for a percent of your maximum health. In addition to increased survivability, this skill should help reduce the impact of managing your Force with Consumption. * **Corrupted Speed:** This new utility skill increases the duration of your Force Speed and finishes the cooldown on Force Speed when Force Barrier ends. This gives you the means to a quick getaway after using Force Barrier. When coupled with the existing Fadeout skill, you should be harder than ever to pin down. * **Force Surge:** This skill has been redesigned. Now Innervate critical hits grant 1 charge of Force Surge. Each charge can be spent on Consumption as before to make Consumption not degenerate your Force. You can now have up to 3 charges of Force Surge. Furthermore, each charge of Force Surge reduces the activation time of your next Revivification by 33.34%, such that Revivification becomes instant when spending 3 charges of Force Surge on it.  &gt;***Lightning***  &gt;Lightning has gotten a few major changes in 2.0 that should improve their gameplay considerably. However, we’ve also made considerations for how Lightning affects the rest of the game (other player’s gameplay) through Backlash.  &gt;* **Fixed Backlash:** This effect now only triggers when a Static Barrier you put on yourself ends. Placing Static Barrier on an ally will not trigger the Backlash effect when that Static Barrier ends. Furthermore, Backlash’s control effect now breaks from direct damage. Although this change has been a long time coming, we wanted to make sure we didn’t undermine the group support role Backlash had been providing Lightning. To offset this change, we’ve made further changes to Lightning and Sorcerers to help facilitate a strong support role.    * **Lightning Swarm:** This new utility skill causes Chain Lightning to slow and briefly immobilize all affected targets. With the increased chance of triggering Lightning Storm, Chain Lightning (and subsequently this effect) will be available very often.    * **Dark Heal:** As previously mentioned, Dark Heal now heals for significantly more. All Sorcerers should have better spot healing or off-healing capabilities.    * Static Barrier: As previously mentioned, Static Barrier no longer has a cooldown, making it easier to protect more allies. * **More Lightning Storm:** This skill’s proc chance has been significantly increased, and Thundering Blast now has a chance to trigger Lightning Storm for better full tree synergy. * **Conduction:** Each time this skill is triggered and stacks, the active cooldown of Polarity Shift is reduced. * **Chaos Nexus:** This new skill increases the chance that Forked Lightning will trigger while Polarity Shift is active. It additionally reduces the cooldown of Polarity Shift and increases its duration. * **Force Haste:** This new utility skill reduces the cooldowns of Force Speed, Force Slow, and Force Barrier. * **Reverberating Force:** This is now a 2-pt skill instead of a 5-pt skill. Its total effectiveness has not been changed. This change frees up more skill points for more utility. * **Forked Darkness:** This new skill gives Crushing Darkness a chance to tick twice and Thundering Blast a chance to produce a second blast, similar to Forked Lightning.  &gt;***Madness (Sorcerer)***  &gt;* **Force Horrors:** Now affects all periodic damage dealt so that Creeping Terror better synergizes with the skill tree. * **Deathmark:** Now applies 15 charges instead of 10. * **Death Field:** Now affects up to 5 targets instead of 3. * **Wrath:** Now when this effect procs, the damage dealt by your next Crushing Darkness or Lightning Strike is increased by 35% (up from 20%). * **Haunted Dreams:** The activation time reduction on Whirlwind has been reduced in effectiveness. Previously, this skill gave Madness a lot of extra lockdown that we weren’t too pleased with, and after the introduction of Force Barrier, Madness’s ability to flee and avoid conflict exceeded acceptable levels. Now this skill reduces the activation time of Whirlwind to 1.5 seconds. The stun effect when Whirlwind ends prematurely due to damage has not been altered. * **Lightning Burns:** With this new skill, when your Force Lightning or Lightning Strike deals damage, it has a chance to deal additional energy damage after 1 second. Damage dealt by these Lightning Burns restores 2 Force (with max points). * **Focal Lightning:** This new skill gives Force Lightning and Lightning Strike a chance to build stacks of Focal Lightning, which increases Alacrity by 1%. Stacks up to 4 times. * **Shapeless Spirit:** This new utility skill reduces all damage taken by 30% while stunned. Madness has a good deal of self healing through effects like Parasitism and Death Field, but this healing isn’t on-demand and can’t counter burst at key moments. As a result, Madness is especially vulnerable to being bursted down while controlled, so we added Shapeless Spirit to help Madness’s survivability in that department.  &gt;##Assassin  &gt;* **Electrostaves:** Key abilities like Thrash, Voltaic Slash, and Maul can now be used with an electrostaff! * **Discharge:** This ability no longer has a cooldown for Lightning Charge or Surging Charge. Using Discharge with Dark Charge active now issues a 6-second cooldown. Dark Charge’s accuracy reduction effect from Discharge now lasts 30 seconds. ",™

It isn't the number of churches, or people saying ""Bless you"". I'm sure it plays its part, but it goes beyond it.  It is attitude. Up north people tended not to get into the business of everyone around them, and assuming that everyone was (or should be) the same. It allowed a little more breathing room.  Since moving down here, I've had the following:  * People open conversations asking what church I go to. * Potential employers ask about my faith. Yeah, didn't get that job. * Door to door Baptists. Baptists! I half expect Mormons and Jehovah's Witlessness, but Baptists? * Religious displays in my child's **public** school. (I wanted to do something, but refrained at *their* request.) * Same school science teacher telling kids that he doesn't believe in evolution or Pangaea.  * My kids taunted and teased when they said they didn't believe in *one particular* subbranch of Christianity. Luckily they didn't have the word atheist used. * Schools that are pushing the limits in other ways. Prayers at after school events, promoting religious groups outside of school, Rachel's challenge bullshit. * On a little less personal level - My governor praying for rain to stop record wildfires, enough so we can cut fire department budgets (really)  It was **never** like this when I was up north. Over a span of many years, I only had a run in with 2 co-workers over religion. One wanted to report me to HR for being an atheist. It was *she* who was laughed at, not me. Down here, that same thing would be a reprimand if not a friable offense.   Down here, I avoid mention of religion until I know I am in safe company.

t5_2qh16,jubbergun,1366444130,"Not sure where you got that definition, but law.com has few of interest:  http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2119  *Theft: n. the generic term for all crimes in which a person intentionally and fraudulently takes personal property of another without permission or consent* **and with the intent to convert it to the taker's use (including potential sale).** *In many states, if the value of the property taken is low (for example, less than $500) the crime is ""petty theft,"" but it is ""grand theft"" for larger amounts, designated misdemeanor or felony, respectively. Theft is synonymous with ""larceny."" Although robbery (taking by force), burglary (taken by entering unlawfully) and embezzlement (stealing from an employer) are all commonly thought of as theft, they are distinguished by the means and methods used and are separately designated as those types of crimes in criminal charges and statutory punishments.*  http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=355  *Copyright: 1) n. the exclusive right of the author or creator of a literary or artistic* **property** *(such as a book, movie or musical composition) to print, copy, sell, license, distribute, transform to another medium, translate, record or perform or otherwise use (or not use) and to give it to another by will. As soon as a work is created and is in a tangible form (such as writing or taping) the work automatically has federal copyright protection. On any distributed and/or published work a notice should be affixed stating the word copyright, copy or ©, with the name of the creator and the date of copyright (which is the year of first publication). The notice should be on the title page or the page immediately following and for graphic arts on a clearly visible or accessible place. A work should be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office by submitting a registration form and two copies of the work with a fee which a) establishes proof of earliest creation and publication, b) is required to file a lawsuit for infringement of copyright, c) if filed within three months of publication, establishes a right to attorneys' fees in an infringement suit. Copyrights cover the following:* **literary, musical and dramatic works, periodicals, maps, works of art (including models), art reproductions, sculptural works, technical drawings, photographs, prints (including labels), movies and other audiovisual works, computer programs, compilations of works and derivative works, and architectural drawings.** *Not subject to copyright are short phrases, titles, extemporaneous speeches or live unrecorded performances, common information, government publications, mere ideas, and seditious, obscene, libelous and fraudulent work. For any work created from 1978 to date, a copyright is good for the author's life, plus 50 years, with a few exceptions such as work ""for hire"" which is owned by the one commissioning the work for a period of 75 years from publication. After that it falls into the public domain. Many, but not all, countries recognize international copyrights under the ""Universal Copyright Convention,"" to which the United States is a party.*  There's a pretty big difference between your unreferenced definition and the one from law.com.  In the law.com definition it doesn't matter whether the owner is deprived of use of the property, it only matters that the thief has converted the property in question to their use.  The second definition should also confirm that intellectual works are considered property, despite what Dr. ""You can't own things, man"" may suggest.",©

t5_2qyt6,turkeyrock,1366448809,"You make some excellent points about making the chips and labor costs, but ignore the added jobs of a large company and the completely different reality of the company.   Originally, this was a few people chopping up chips and bagging them by hand. They were probably made with local potatoes, and sold locally. That was all they did.   The company is much different now. Straight from their website:  ""To keep in step with consumer demand, Herr's® began producing a number of new products: 1976 Cheese Curls, 1978 Popcorn, 1981 Pretzels, 1983 Corn products, such as corn and tortilla chips, 1984 Onion Rings."" - certainly a large number of employees are related to these products as well, they aren't all cutting potatoes anymore.   ""In the spring of 1984 the first load of 300 steers was delivered to the farm, and operations began. The cattle were fed potato peelings and rejected food products, mixed with traditional cattle feed."" - they are also now a cattle ranch, that takes jobs.   Most recently ""Our full line of quality snacks currently consists of more than 340 items including......"" Potato chips aren't their only bag anymore (badum tiss).   FWIW - I enjoyed reading your post, and upvoted it. But your view and analysis of the company was too narrow, and therefore incorrect.",®

But luckily I also saved a copy of that comment on my PC back when I posted it, so here it is, albeit without context (deducing which is thus left to the reader's imagination):  &gt; Not an American, but for what it's worth:  &gt; I think there's an underlying conviction on the Republican side that ""there's not enough for everybody"", and that this is a natural state of affairs, and that it either cannot or should not be different (the latter view is based in something that's to do with a ""not everybody will be saved"" attitude, which is an attitude that's technically called [social Darwinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism)  [EDIT: a term which would freak teabaggers out]).  &gt; On the progressive side meanwhile, there's an underlying conviction that systemic problems are man-made mistakes, that things should be fixed, and if only we did things right, there would be enough to go around.   &gt; The reactions we're seeing are just consequences of these convictions. The more miserable individual teabaggers are, the more their misery affirms to them that there *obviously* isn't enough for everybody, hence injustices need to be reinforced, not removed, and of course preferably so in a way that eventually leaves *them* just above the cut-off, because they're the good guys, right? They did everything right. They're *Real Christians™*. They go to church and everything. Well, they go to church more often than those other guys at any rate. Anyway, their good Christian leaders wouldn't leave godly God-fearing fellow Christians in the dust, now would they? (Would they?) So by whatever miracle, *they'll* be saved. And thence *fuck you, got mine*.  EDIT2: The parent post, since deleted, said something along the lines of ""Stop whining, we can't pay for everything you want.""

t5_2ssmu,olympic_lifter,1366489363,"Conventional deadlift technique is very different in certain key ways from, say, clean technique. All of this applies to snatches as well, but it's even harder with cleans because the weight is heavier.  In the clean it is extremely important to stay ""over the bar"" for as long as possible. That means the shoulders should be forward of the bar, [like this](http://www.catalystathletics.com/workouts/images/120329-steveClean.jpg), and NOT like the picture in the upper right corner. The hamstrings, lats, and posterior chain in general need to be much, much stronger to succeed in this as opposed to the quad-dominant deadlift.  The bad news is that it's more of a problem than just a posterior-chain strength deficit - it's a major motor pattern. The deadlift motor pattern is extremely natural for maximal weights, and quad-dominant lifters will usually default to it as their clean weights increase. This screws with timing and bar path and will usually cause the bar to crash hard on you as well as ending up out front. I don't think I need to enumerate all the reasons those are Bad Things™.  There are more major issues and plenty of finer points I could go into, but that one is by far the biggest. It's also the main reason that Olympic lifters, when doing clean/snatch pulls, do not generally go more than 10%-20% over their max full lift, even on the heaviest days.",™

Comments such as ""I want it to stay illegal to piss off the potheads."" It's simply confusing to say the least.  Whether you're for it or against it, when it finally hits you that we've been  lied to for nigh on 70 years, maybe more, then it makes you wonder what else  we have been lied to about.  Are we being protected or controlled?  Should we blame anyone in particular?  Or is this all a result of human  misunderstandings?  In the end, we all want to do the right thing, no matter  if we know that the ""right"" thing is truly right, we do the best we can.  Most of all, just stop the hate, not just for miss Mary Jane.  ==============================================================================  In addition to the content below When We Grow - newer documentary discussing the topic mostly in the UK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSKJrgGqx_E  ( This part used to be found @ http://pastie.org/2738750 [older] )  The below has be updated for valid linkage on Friday, April 27, 2012:  Perhaps a Wikileaks source.

""Multimillion operation"" to continue marijuana prohibition but you can grow a plant and get more seeds to continue growing if that's  what you do, you can't grow money and get more money to keep enforcing this  ""war on drugs"".

Really?     Aggressiveness doesn't seem to get us to many places in a modernized          world where the individuals think highly of themselves         (myself included -- why else go through the trouble of writing this?)     What has *truly* been accomplished?  Not much from the looks of it.      Actually I've got some faith in the people.  I think we can help *each*     person around us.

Learning how to use windows is just like learning how to use any new software, and the best way in my opinion is to learn through supervised practice sessions.  As for printed media, I know there are countless books that teach you how to use a computer for casual purposes.  Avoid books which have too much computer lingo, and go for something that is explicitly advertised for people who have no prior experience in using computers.  Ever time I learn how to use a new technology, I opt for that kind of literature.  Some of my favorites are ""Learning X for dummies"", for "" the complete idiot's guide to X"".  I like those books and don't let their odd titles discourage you, because they are really good at explaining concepts which are 100% new to someone.  What windows version does she have?  Some very basic literature that might help is a book like ""Windows 8 for dummies"" http://www.dummies.com/store/product/Windows-8-For-Dummies.productCd-1118134613.html.

BHAA!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XRLgNlchU4#t=1m22s) And, yeah, the cookies are there purely because of the show.  But honestly, I don't drink tea because it's ""British"". I drink it because I like it. I first tried it years ago. And yes, I did so after reading an essay by Douglas Adams—not because it was ""British-y""—but because his [description](http://www.h2g2.com/approved_entry/A61345) made it sound so wonderful.

And I don't think anybody could accuse my enjoyment of the music of an old, dead, German Lutheran of being a fetishization of British culture.  Later, when I reached the legal drinking age, it was probably his constant references to gin and tonic that caused me to try that drink.  And it was due to the fact that I knew about his historical involvement with the show that I first tried *Doctor Who*.  All of those things speak more to the influence of Douglas Adams on me at a point in life where his work seems so capable of capturing and shaping a young, impressionable person's mind.  You could probably do this for several other authors, as well—likely for all those who were my favorites during the time when I was forming my personality and figuring out who I was.  Thank god I didn't read any [Ayn Rand at that point, and instead opted for Tolkien.](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/366635-there-are-two-novels-that-can-change-a-bookish-fourteen-year)  **EDIT: TL;DR: Every piece of culture we've ever consumed has shaped and affected us in some way.

t5_2qh18,henryheikkinen,1366511461,"Depends on the outputs. As long as you have enough outputs, you can run up to six monitors. Only two monitors can be connected through DVI/HDMI and the rest need to be connected through (mini-)DisplayPort (can be converted to DVI/HDMI using an **active** adapter).  Edit:  &gt; ## What are the basic requirements for connecting multiple displays? &gt; &gt; Connecting multiple monitors for AMD Eyefinity technology couldn’t be simpler. There are four easy rules to remember: &gt; &gt; The first two monitors can connect to the graphics card with any display output on your product: HDMI, VGA, DVI or DisplayPort. &gt; &gt; The third (or greater) display must be connected to the graphics card via DisplayPort. &gt; &gt; If your monitor does not have a DisplayPort connection, you will need an inexpensive active DisplayPort adapter for it. DVI to DP adapters can be had for less than $30 USD.2 &gt; &gt; Every family of GPUs supports a different maximum number of displays. &gt; &gt; Remember that these are the most basic requirements. Creative designs like the Sapphire FleX HD 7950 or the MSI R7970 Lightning make it even easier to configure AMD Eyefinity technology by reducing, or even eliminating some of these requirements for AMD Radeon™ graphics products. In that respect, always make sure to carefully explore these non-reference solutions and their product specifications when configuring a system with AMD Eyefinity technology. &gt; &gt; ## What is the maximum number of monitors I can connect? &gt; As we mentioned in the last question, every family of GPUs supports a different maximum number of displays. This support is inherent to the AMD graphics chip at the heart of your graphics card.  &gt; Before looking through the table, though, keep in mind that the maximum number of supported displays can differ from the number of display outputs on the card. Certain adapters, hubs, or a non-reference graphics card may be required to take full advantage of the capabilities we build into our chips. &gt;  &gt; ## AMD Radeon™ graphics solutions &gt;  &gt; |Displays|Card &gt; |-|- &gt; |Up to 6 displays|AMD Radeon™ HD 7900 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 7800 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 7700 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6900 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6900M Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6800 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6800M Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6700M Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6600M Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6500M Series &gt; ||ATI Radeon™ HD 5800 Series &gt; |Up to 5 displays|AMD Radeon™ HD 6700 Series &gt; ||ATI Radeon™ HD 5700 Series &gt; |Up to 4 displays|AMD Radeon™ HD 6600 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6500 Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6400M Series &gt; ||AMD Radeon™ HD 6300M Series &gt; |Up to 3 displays|AMD Radeon™ HD 6400 Series &gt; ||ATI Radeon™ HD 5600 Series &gt; ||ATI Radeon™ HD 5500 Series &gt; ||ATI Radeon™ HD 5400 Series &gt;  &gt; ## AMD FirePro™ Professional Graphics &gt;  &gt; |Displays|Card &gt; |-|- &gt; |Up to 6 displays|ATI FirePro™ V9800 &gt; |Up to 4 displays|ATI FirePro™ V8800 &gt; ||AMD FirePro™ V7900 &gt; ||ATI FirePro™ 2460 Multi-View &gt; |Up to 3 displays|ATI FirePro™ V7800 &gt; ||AMD FirePro™ V5900 &gt; ||ATI FirePro™ V5800 &gt; ||ATI FirePro™ V4800  [Source](http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/how-to/Pages/faqs.aspx)",™

I would say this anyway, but particularly in your situation. Life is for living, and not for commuting.    * I'd avoid co-signing with parents in your situation, but financially I agree it's a good offer.  But I would still avoid that.  Don't put a downpayment on anything yet.  Just rent something. Find a apartment -- shared if you want to do something for cheap -- and enjoy living carefree.     Most importantly:  DO NOT BUY 500 SHARES OF APPLE STOCK.  Generally, you want to keep a diversified portfolio.  Index funds are your very good friends.  Check out the [Investing Start-Up Guide](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investing_start-up_kit) for more details.      The vague and generalizing order of financial goals is roughly as follows for most debt-free people:  * Keep an emergency fund of 6mos' living expenses in a high-interest savings account.  Reddit likes [ally](http://ally.com). (I do too.)  * Max out retirement fund contributions.  If your employer has a 401k, contribute at least up to any match. Open an IRA (Vanguard is good, and where I have mine).  * Once retirement is maxed out, contribute to index funds outside of retirement.  That gets you started well.  If you want to retire at 30, things are slightly different, but not so much so.   edit: formatting...",®

Soft grass tickling your bare feet. Your first kiss. Your first love. It will happen. The children you might have. The wedding day you'd miss. Picking out the perfect dress for prom. The way your confidence boosts when your mascara is just right. The perfect adorable nail design. A new song you can jam to. Singing in the shower like a pop star. Going to the movies.

t5_2qlqh,DigitalChocobo,1366566847,"EDIT: **I thought of a better one!** I call it TruePaste™. Basically, when you copy and paste text, the text will be pasted exactly as you copied it; no more adding a space before or after. Having the text you copied be the text that gets pasted will revolutionize smart phones, as you will no longer have to waste time getting the cursor right on the extra space to delete it.   Original comment:  I'm really hoping for multi-step or complex voice commands.  Currently, you can use Voice Search to get details for your next calendar appointment, and you can use Voice Search to email Bob. But how about emailing Bob details on next your appointment with a single command?  Or what if you could ask ""What's the weather forecast for Tommy's next baseball game?"" It checks your calendar for the next event that contains the phrase Tommy's baseball game, then it tells you what the weather will be like at that time.  *****  Or imagine you, Bob, and Steve all share calendars with each other, and you could have this exchange:  ""Is there a time that Bob, Steve, and I are all available for an hour on Tuesday?""  Voice Search compares the three calendars to find a time all of you open, and responds ""All of you are available for one hour at 11 AM on Tuesday.""  Then you reply with ""Schedule that as a meeting in my calendar, and email them the details."" Voice Search uses the previous conversation to determine what ""that"", ""them"", and ""the details"" refer to, and completes the request.  Some of these capabilities already exist. Google calendar can already look at multiple calendars to determine when everybody is available. Keeping track of people pronouns shouldn't be too hard, although ""that"" and ""details"" might be tricky. The biggest hurdle would be understanding your language, but I wouldn't mind if certain phrasings were required for these more complicated tasks.  *****  I think when these apps do things like that, you can really start calling them voice assistants.",™

Some companies and many governmental, university, or military environments require that some users and computers exist in a separate domain. If such a policy exists, it should be re-evaluated as the domain is no longer the security boundary it was in Windows NT® 4.0 and previous versions. If the policy is around isolation requirements, a separate forest will be required.   •	Are there different administrative units that need to be autonomous?

However, politics, corporate structure, administrative controls, and other factors might cause a need for additional domains instead.  So in this case, one domain one forest :)",®

t5_2cneq,firemylasers,1366570905,"&gt;Yeah, except for the bt corn allergies which haven't been properly tested by the FDA (and the EPA concluded that there was a risk of allergy) because Monsanto told the FDA to fuck off.  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/business/study-raises-doubt-about-allergy-to-genetic-corn.html  &gt;In the test, the subject was given StarLink corn, other corn and a placebo on different days, without him or the doctors knowing which was which. There was no sign of an allergic reaction on any day.  http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/section-3/3-5-starlink/  &gt;1.  The Bt in Starlink corn has never been shown to be allergen and careful analysis of the Starlink event yields the conclusion that the Bt protein in Starlink, Cry9c, is mostly likely not an allergen. Contrary to Smith’s claims, most food-allergy experts believed that there was almost no chance that Starlink contained an allergen, while the EPA advisory panel apparently felt there was some very small but real chance it could become an allergen (CDC 2001, Lemaux 2008, Hefle and Taylor 2001). The problem observed with Cry9C is that it digests slowly in the simulated gastric fluid assay.  This doesn’t mean it is an allergen since indigestible proteins are not necessarily allergens.  At the time of the Starlink episode, known expert scientific opinion was backing away from an earlier proposition that protein indigestibility was an indicator of potential allergenicity.   More recently, some experts say that we should move away from the digestion assay completely because it is not predictive of allergenicity (Goodman and others 2008).  The EPA and EPA expert panels placed too much emphasis on the digestion assay.  They treated poor digestibility as an indicator of allergencity and did not sufficiently weight other data such as the fact that no Cry protein has ever caused human allergy or that the Bt protein in question, Cry9c, does not possess any structural resemblance to any known allergen.  It may be that EPA was too precautionary in their approach and sought 100 percent certainty that Cry9C was not an allergen.  &gt;3.  People were scared by the recall and many attributed their illnesses to Starlink. It is an unfortunate and well-documented fact that when scares like Starlink are announced and people then become ill, they will naturally attribute their illness to whatever is being recalled.  Think about it. If you ate a taco, became ill a couple of hours later, and then heard that taco shells were being recalled by the government, wouldn’t it enter your mind that maybe your illness was due to the taco you just ate?  Consumers can’t be criticized for thinking that if something is being recalled it must be dangerous.  In fact, dozens of claimed Starlink-related illnesses were carefully investigated and not a single subject had an IgE antibody that reacted with Cry9C—the Gold Standard test required to show allergenicity (Hefle and Taylor 2001).  There is no evidence that a single consumer was actually hurt by Starlink.  http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/summary.htm  &gt;On October 25, 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in investigating adverse event reports (AERs) of human illnesses that were potentially associated with consumption of genetically modified corn products. Prior to these reports, a protein named Cry9c had been inserted into genetically modified StarLink™ corn; it subsequently and inadvertently was introduced into the human food supply. CDC conducted an epidemiological investigation that included (1) reviewing the AERs, (2) administering questionnaires to all people who experienced adverse health effects and manifested signs and symptoms consistent with allergic reaction, (3) obtaining relevant medical records, and (4) collecting serum samples for temporary banking. The investigation concluded that 28 people had experienced apparent allergic reactions. These people had also reported eating corn products that may have contained Cry9c protein. With the endorsement of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Scientific Advisory Panel which convened on November 28, 2000, CDC recommended that the banked serum samples be evaluated to see if they contained evidence of an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;An FDA laboratory developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect antibodies to the Cry9c protein. CDC sent coded serum samples to FDA for analysis, including serum samples from the affected people and historically banked serum samples collected before Cry9c entered the food supply. CDC also sent serum samples from people identified as being highly sensitive to a variety of allergens. The ELISA method found that none of the CDC-submitted samples reacted in a manner consistent with an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;These findings do not provide any evidence that the reactions that the affected people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Cry9c protein. The difficulties of this investigation highlight the importance of evaluating the allergic potential of genetically modified foods before they become available for human consumption.  http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/BTgen.pdf  &gt;Eighteen human volunteers ingested a B.t. pesticide daily for 5 days. Five of the volunteers also inhaled the pesticide for 5 days. Scientists did not detect any adverse effects in the volunteers  http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/teach/agbio2011/Other%20Readings/Shelton_BtCropMgt_AnnRevEnt2002.pdf  &gt;The EPA does not require long-term studies because the protein’s instability in digestive fluids makes such studies meaningless in terms of consumer health",™

t5_2qh6c,SlightlyAmused,1366571090,"I don't think it's our job nor do we truly have the ability to judge or determine whether someone else is a *real true* Christian because, being the mere mortals we are, we can't know the hearts and beliefs of others beyond the superficial surface level. Hence, its futile to go round making these judgments about others and it's probably best to leave that task up to God, who is more than capable of doing so without our added commentary on the matter. Faith is a deeply personal matter. As far as we're concerned (due to our limited true-faith-detection capabilities), if someone says they're Christian, then they're Christian. There's zero point in trying to prove or proclaim otherwise, as we are not God nor should we try to be.       Obviously that doesn't mean you have to agree with everyone's take on Christianity nor is anyone asking you to apply others' beliefs to your own life. But if the existence of squillons of different sects and denominations of Christianity in the world shows us anything, it's that there are countless possible ways of interpreting scripture so there is no tangible answer or solid way of determining who is Christian™.

Used by the legendary Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Jim Courier as well as current  pro's like James Blake, The Bryan Brothers, John Isner, Sam Querry, Andy Murray,  Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon, Venus Williams, Dinara Safina, Elena Dementieva, &amp;  Maria Sharapova, just to name a few.   These players demand not only top performance but consistent, exacting quality. This is why more touring pro's use Tourna-Grip® than any other overgrip, just look for the light blue grip on their rackets.  The secret is that Tourna-Grip® actually performs better with moisture when all other  overgrips on the market get slippery with moisture. When the match is tight, and every point counts, the last thing you need to worry about is your grip slipping.  Tourna-Grip® is made from only the finest, highest quality materials available in the world.  We blend layer upon layer using a proprietary, precision based manufacturing process.  We then wrap each individual grip with a special liner to keep it in perfect condition.  We invented the overgrip and have made it in the USA since 1997.  Often imitated, never duplicated, Tourna-Grip® is the choice of professional and serious tennis, racquetball, squash, and badmitten players since 1977. You have our promise that  we will never change the time tested excellent quality and performance of Tourna Grip®.  The Tourna-Grip® Light Blue Color® is a Federally Registered Trademark.  ",®
t5_2trms,TeaEyeM,1366591617,"In a previous game i also played a Monk of irori, here is a copy of my code along ans some things i had said to other party members or npc's we had faced...  ▪	As food nourishes my body, knowledge nourishes my soul.  ▪	My body is my greatest possession; through it all things are possible.  ▪	Where I have no emotion, I have clarity,  ▪	I shall show mercy, but I shall expect it from none.  ▪	Truth is immortal, and through it, I am as well.  ▪	I do not wish it easier, I wish myself better.   ▪	To the vices of men I shall not faultier, for through purity I am whole.  ▪	To err is human; I grant forgiveness to all who seek it.  ▪	My success is not final, my failure is not fatal. My courage to carry on is what defines me.  ▪	I am content to be myself, through this I have earned all the respect I require.    “I am not going to kill you, for your demise would bring me no joy, and your survival no harm. I suggest you leave and never return. If you do not heed my suggestion, and warn your masters of my presence, know that I will not care, but this mercy will not befall you once more. Rethink the choices you have made in your life, and think even harder on those you are about to make, for they very well may be your last.”  “What have these men done to deserve death? Certainly they have made some poor decisions in their life, but they are doing nothing more then following the orders of those who they believe are right. Cleric, I ask you if Iomedae appeared and told you to spare this man, would you? What if he told you to kill people whom you have never met and who you could not know their disgressions? Would that be any different than what this man has done? He is simply following orders. Our gripe is not with him, but his masters. Men can change; if he does not then you have my permission to do with him what you please. Spare his life or I may begin to question if I myself have fallen in with the wrong crowd.”  “Rogue, you seem motivated by your own gains. I know not why you journey with us, and I do not care why, but I ask you; what do you gain from murder? The benefits of letting this man live would greatly outweigh the risks. You seem so set on killing anyone who has wronged you, while I do admire your strength and persistence, I feel that teaching those men a lesson and letting them live could be far more beneficial to you. The reputation you would gain would be that of fear and respect, rather than fear and hate. Let your enemies know that it is not wise to cross you, but spare them forgiveness when it is necessary.” ",▪

The fact that you do have the discipline, financial nous, and opportunity to have saved thousands of dollars working in unskilled positions will certainly help you: you can pay 90% of your costs, and only have 10% of the debt that your peers will have, meaning you'll be able to save much more of your postgraduate income in that first decade than your peers.

t5_2qhzo,Wiskeyjac,1366602696,"Maille is a wonderfully historic armor, seen in almost every part of antiquity.  It'll suit you whether you're Againcourt-era English, or nearly out-of-period Ottoman Turk.  It does not, unfortunately, work particularly well against the type of sport combat that you'll find in SCA heavy.  It looks nice, and sounds pretty when it passes a blow through, but it's not rigid enough to provide a lot of protection against the rattan weapons we use.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't use it, just that you should know the limitations.  You've said you'll be using a gambeson below it, that's a good start, but as others have said, you'll need to add to that a bit.  A kidney belt that covers the (appropriately enough) kidneys and lower rips is a common minimal-armor solution.  I've heard that recently the Zoombang Smartpads [""Maximum Coverage Garments""](http://www.zoombang.com/zoombang_shop_category.php?i=25) line is acceptable in many kingdoms for hidden armor.  I've not used it myself, but I've heard some folks are quite happy with the protection it offers.  Beyond that, you can usually put together a quite cheap, quiet, and hidden ensemble to wear under the maille, such as a Coat of Plates in heavy cloth, some leather bazubands (combination vambrace and elbow cop, historically found in Russia, Eastern Europe, India and the Near East), and leather knees worn under your pants, that will meet most kingdom requirements.  Having the parts made from leather or, where possible, ABS plastic will keep the load light enough that the weight of a hauberk should overwhelm it :D  As to making maille, it's a pretty common hobby in the SCA since it's portable and is easy to get started with.  It's not my cup of tea, but you should be able to find lots of good help in your Friendly Local Group™ or over at the Armor Archive's [Design &amp; Construction](http://forums.armourarchive.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=1&amp;sid=9d38dd452ad5c0317a55ee2f6199ad43) forum",™

t5_2r9po,Mortons_Spork,1366626687,"WvW is pretty much like ""Who's Line is it Anyway?"", it's a game where everything is made up and the points don't matter.   The static nature of all capture points, whether it be a minor supply camp or a major keep makes WvW rather stale and predictable. This coupled with the lack of meaningful and *interesting* personal progression (idc if Anet will Soon™ eventually rolling out active WvW abilities, these passives were far too boring and hardly noticeable anyway) and the fact that the entire thing has little lasting effect or any significant impact. There's not even any immersive factors to make me really care if server X or server Y dominate, if there were true factions with themes it might be easier to try and pretend that it matters, but it doesn't.   Sure you get XP, Karma and Badges, and that is great as an alternative way to gear up a char I guess but for the vast majority of players who have been decked out for months now it's of little interest.   Anyways, so what to do? Static cap points encourage zergs to ""connect the dots"", just running from point to point. Perhaps multiple WvW Dynamic Events could simultaneously occur randomly throughout the zone for a very limited time, that would offer incentives for zergs to break up and actively encourage smaller team play.   Implement a truly role-defining tree system. Yeah, I get it, they are working on active abilities. But if they are anything like these shitty passives, I can see them being about as effective as what current racial elite abilities are; worthless. They could have started the passives to form the foundation of certain roles in WvW with even smaller branches within them.   Things like a ""Shocktrooper"" specializing in infantry-to-infantry combat. Or a ""Siege Master"" that they sort of half-assed, specializing in building new types of siege weapons or building different defensive upgrades. And finally maybe a ""Tactician"" that focuses on giving buffs or dishing out debuffs for either large zergs or smaller teams.  For balancing purposes, there could be entirely new sets of gear with completely new stats that replace current ones, enhancing these roles at the expense of a few stats lost or whatever.  TL;DR Anet should add multiple WvW-oriented Dynamic Events scattered all over a zone for a limited time in order to break up zergs and encourage small team play. They also need to roll out truly role-defining WvW progression trees and new sets of gear to complement them. All this not only would add some meaning to it all but also change the game, breathing new life into an otherwise stale one.",™

t5_2rske,HangBone,1366632320,"I'm sorry to hear that you have been sick. I hope you kicked that cold in the ass for knocking you on yours for a little while.  I really don't know what to say to such a magnificent reply except thank you so much for this encouraging message. I am stunned speechless as such a supportive community of strangers (Yeah, speechless, if you can't tell by the length of my own reply). To take directly from V for Vendetta, this line from Valeria’s letter sums up how I feel for you: ""I don't know who you are...I may never see you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But I love you.""   &gt;“It has helped me change my body, my relationship to food, and my willpower/self-discipline.”   In your reply, this line stood out to me because it reflects how the Keto lifestyle, even in this short amount of time, effectively change my very consciousness. As a child, my parents (like many others’ parents) had always told me to finish everything on my plate; nothing can go to waste. When I become an adult, my eating habits mirrored what I was told as a child. I listened to the external queues telling me if there is food around, I better eat it.  You’ve heard the joke: “I’m on a seafood diet. I see food, I eat food.” In reality, the seefood diet was one I was dangerously and uncontrollably practicing. When you stated how Keto has changed your relationship to food and willpower, I completely understand what you mean. I am happily in control of what goes into my body.  Knowing that I have to maintain Ketosis has become a wonderful incentive for me to stay away from carbs. Another thing fueling me is how outraged I am at the “healthy food” facts cough lies cough I’ve bought into. This whole grain, whole wheat is better bullshit. My husband blood sugar still suffered. However, not with Keto, we feel healthier and happier than in our early 20s.   I have an achievement I want to share with you:  Back story first: My husband and I moved 30 minutes away via freeway from our main group of friends; however, when we lived closer, 2-4 times a week, the group would gather at my friend Udara’s house. While there, we would watch movies, play board games, plot villainy, all the while surround by sugary and/or alcoholic drinks and junk food, and we (the husband and I) would just munch away: playing games and eating chip, watching a movie and drinking beer. Achievement: However, recently, when we visit Udara’s place (which is about once or twice a month) the drinks and junk foods are still circulating, but we are not tempted to partake in any of it. My friends have commented that I need to eat something when I turn down their chip bag offer. Because they are still used to the old us. Now, if we want a snack, we munch on almonds or peanuts and always in moderation. My huaband and I definitely feel more in control and selective of what we eat, and for that, I am very proud of myself and my husband.    &gt;“I definitely love myself.”   Your whole reply made me smile, but this passage, especially just stopped me for a moment and take in the brevity of it. I can honestly say that I love myself, too. This was something that was really hard for me; however, I’m 26 years old and it only took me about 25.5 years, but I can say without a doubt, that I love who I was, who I am, who I am becoming, and who I will become. You need not worry about me. I’m slowly seeing how beautiful I truly am, and my body image is slowly improving. I can’t wait until I can show my friends my new sexy summer body. ☺ ----And my narcissism has set in.    &gt;“And maybe I'm wrong, but who cares! What bad can come from you telling yourself that you love yourself?”  About three years ago, when I was at my heaviest weight, I was just not happy with myself. Around that time, I was also getting married to my boyfriend of 6 years. (Eight years and eleven months together, today) I was a backwards bride. Instead of getting into shape and healthy because I was getting marry, because I got married, I started getting healthy.  With my new husband, I started my weight loss journey. I stated first with biking, not alot of biking, just slowly biking on weekends with him.  We started to loss a decent amount of weight but it was always a struggle. After dropping a pan size, I began looking for external encouragement to keep he and I moving forward. The first encouragement I gave myself came in the in the form of a homemade speech bubble that read, “You are beautiful.”  I stuck this to the most used mirror and noticed it every time I looked into said mirror (this reminds me that I need to do this at my new place). The second form of encouragement is a tattooed on my left ring finger that reads, “You are loved.” This tattoo reflects both how my husband makes me feel and how I feel for myself. Surprisingly, I do forget that the tattoo is there, but when I see it, it’s like falling in love all over again. Realization just washes over me and I smile at the feeling of being loved.   I love that you quoted RuPaul as if you had known I absolutely adore her. And yes, I agree with what she says. One of my favorite saying goes “A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.” Loving yourself is the hardest step. One must do it first before one can love anyone else.    &gt;“Thank you. I appreciate that. :) I'll work on not downplaying my achievement so much, if you start telling yourself nice things when you get down about not seeing changes yet. Deal?”     Deal.  Let me start by saying, I look fabulous today, in my Kirkland brand tee shirt and tattered denim shorts that were once pants.   Thank you for providing these video links, “Amy Cuddy: Your body language shapes who you are” and “Dr. Lustig: Sugar Pandemic Q &amp; A.” I  have not seen thess videos; this is much appreciated.  I’ve read and reread the “Keto in a nutshell” and followed most to all the resources list at the bottom of the “Keto in a nutshell” page. I’ve done some independent research utilized my university’s research engine and have found some article from journals of medicine on Ketogenic; however, those aren’t as enjoyable as what /r/keto have provided me.    Lastly, I want to take this time to thank you with my whole being for the support that you are provided.  I want you to know that the tone of your writing does not sound patronizing to me. Your discourse is one I do not read as hostile or fake. I see only honesty from you, and for that, I am very touched. “I'm still at the beginning of my keto journey,” to this, I say, let us walk this journey together.

t5_2u69x,corvusbhax,1366635404,"I would think could be interesting if that were so, but I can't argue with the fact there'd be tons of crap slung over the concept as there's more exposure to it.  I'm not too sure what could happen to the community, but I'd imagine it wouldn't be the (excuse the faggotry) cozy loving family atmosphere as it is now.  Even though tulpa isn't a common word, I think in similar phenomena in a way tulpas are common knowledge, with exception of the word 'tulpa'.  There are imaginary friends, which are mostly associated with children, though they serve as a good baser for what tulpas are.  There's also this concept of ""soulbond"" where a writer becomes attached to a character that it eventually seems like the character is a real living being, which for the most part fits into the tulpa concept.  Heck, in movies there are a lot of examples of what can be referred to as tulpas and wonderlands, which says a few things.  There are some barriers to accepting tulpas if it were to become accepted in the greater society.  The idea that a person can have two people up there at once is not a new concept, though sadly according to the general populace that is called Schizophrenia/DID.  Also many people can argue that a tulpa is an excuse for a friend/SO for all who are friendless, even though this isn't necessarily true as tulpas can be closer than any friend/SO could, but don't tell them that (Plus tulpas don't replace friends).    Whatever happens, whether Tulpas® become the next big thing or not, at least we have each other in this great community of escapists.  [*Tulpas are great, but they're simply not for everyone.*]",®

t5_2qzb6,mkautzm,1366664185,"Then defend that opinion.  Here's my two cents:  Planeswalkers represent unbelievable value in some cases.  Brainstorm every turn with no cost?  That by itself is Fucking Bonkers™.  Everything else attached to Jace?  Gravy.  In a constructed format, they represent a huge amount of leverage on the board in some cases.  The 'good' ones do anyway.  It is really dangerous to give single cards the potential value of several.  This problem becomes exaggerated when these particular cards become exceedingly difficult to remove and often times trivial to protect once they hit the board.  Really, I can almost deal with them in a constructed format, but limited really exaggerates their potency, because removal is 1st and 2nd pick material and therefore, rare.  Furthermore, spot removal can't touch them and burn is pretty rare, so baring having superior board position, you might find yourself in a unwinnable position.  Things like Garruk Relentless let you take a superior board position and turn it into a guaranteed win by simply existing.   ",™

t5_2s30g,Greyfeld,1366673736,"&gt;Is this really the case? I guess I can imagine that some people would jump down your throat for saying ""I think it shouldn't be so hard for men to get custody"", but I don't think it's a particularly common problem.  NOW (the National Organization for Women, the largest feminist organization in the US) is actively fighting against default joint custody under the premise that, [""[I]t is unworkable for uncooperative parents; it is dangerous for women and their children who are trying to leave or have left violent husbands/fathers; it ignores the diverse, complicated needs of divorced families; and it is likely to have serious, unintended consequences on child support.""](http://www.now.org/nnt/03-97/father.html)  It should also be noted that feminism is responsible for the [Tender Years Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_years_doctrine), which is the reason that women are defaulted child custody to begin with.  Although, I still occasionally hear feminists claim that, ""We want men to see their children!  The fact that women are awarded primary custody is because of The Patriarchy™!""  Which, as you can see, is categorically untrue.  &gt;What is an issue is the ""men are the real victims!"" that too many people tack onto the end.  In most cases that I've seen, this sentiment only arises from the need to scream loud enough to be heard.  With society's focus on ""women's issues,"" and the inability to even be taken seriously when one claims to be a supporter of the Men's Rights Movement, sometimes it takes a little bit of radical behavior to even be heard.  I don't necessarily agree with it, but they're not actually hurting anyone, and I understand the necessary evil of that sort of thing.  &gt;Your ""feminist-inspired legislation"" simply isn't accurate. Title IX attempts to correct for very real anti-woman discrimination, VAWA is almost entirely gender-neutral, and the tender years doctrine is gone.  Title IX only corrects anti-woman discrimination if you believe that equal outcome is more important than equal opportunity.  Women are routinely encouraged to entire ""traditionally male"" fields, with billions of dollars put into programs specifically targeted at women every year.  If they don't *want* to enter those fields, forcing a 50/50 split along gender lines only discriminates against men who would have gotten the position if it weren't for the need to meet a quota.  This goes equally for female-dominated fields and men, so please don't assume I'm just attacking one side or the other.  VAWA is gender-neutral by letter alone.  The funding granted under VAWA goes primarily to female-only programs and shelters.  And while the Tender Years Doctrine may no longer be a fact of legislation, its application for the years it was enforced molded our divorce system into what it is today.",™

It's much more common on Apple devices, which often use it for Ethernet adapters and such. Saw somebody with a TB&gt;VGA adapter today.) The connector is about as high as USB, so for anything larger than a phone that shouldn't be an issue.  It's not exactly split, it just seems like Apple developed their collaboration with Intel further, into a more mobile-oriented form factor, and came up with Lightning.

t5_2rb2y,spinwizard69,1366715460,"I have to agree pruning just because the method rolls off the screen doesn't make a lot of sense.   There are many algorithms that simply need more than a few lines of code and a bit if setup.    Not to mention comments.    Speaking of comments, in the technical world a few comments that refer to the literature for the technology your method implements can go a very long ways. If the method isn't self explanatory, then it needs comments packaged with the method.   This is especially the case if the programmer doesn't have a solid grasp as to what he is implementing (happens more than you think).    In any event back to the long methods.   Methods need to be as long as required and no longer!!!😇    If the tech being implemented needs 20 lines of code fine, if it needs a 120 then fine.  Whining about having to scroll your screen is childish.   Further breaking up an algorithm into arbitrary sub components often makes maintenance harder not easier.   ",😇

I recommend them over Ego's because the skirt that slips into the neck was made longer because the ego's neck begins to slip out after a little while. They basically worked out all the problems people were having with Ego's and made an awesome battery. it also has a more satiny finish and I honestly think their tanks work better than Vivi novas. Never any slurring noises or popping.  I was planning on making a post recommending these over Ego's, all though a little more expensive (I think, not by much, probably $25 starting price for a battery). They are more durable and very reliable.  I am only giving my review comparison because my first Ego got loose at the neck and slipped out, UN-wiring it totally and it broke after only like two days of having it. My second EGO was a twist and I dropped it one time, the same thing happened, slipped out at the neck because the inner skirt is not long enough. Also the twist part broke after like 3days, it just wouldn't turn anymore. And I am super careful with my things.   Also the Vaporshark is (in my opinion) better because you can charge it while you vape because you charge it from the bottom, I just plug it in on my way to and from work and smoke while it charges and I drive, welcome to the future!

t5_2s30g,KarmaAndLies,1366727550,"&gt; because rage isn't always a controllable thing.     It is. You're actively thinking things that make you rage, there isn't some radar built into your brain which analyses people's hotness quota and makes you upset - you're making yourself upset.      Your thought process is wrong/bad/broken. Think differently™.   &gt; Can you just choose what causes you to get hot under the collar?      Yes, you can. I know I have. There are lot's of things that used to bug me and now I just ""let them go."" It is a daily challenge but eventually you learn to calm down and not let things outside of your control bug you.     Admitting that your rage is in your control is the first step in controlling it. If you don't you'll wind up dying early from stress or winding up on YouTube because you tried to beat someone up who cut you off in traffic...      In general I've never ""raged"" about some random guy with some hot chick. I don't know their back story, personalities, or even their relationship. I cannot judge anything from two people who happen to be in proximity of one another and who happen to be different levels of ""hotness.""      For all I know they're brother and sister.

t5_2snuc,tyrandan2,1366729953,"&gt;My serious answer is there's a big difference between being free and being not free, regardless of how well you are treated. Your lack of freedom limits your capabilities as a human being beyond what your environment normally would.  Can you prove that?  &gt;My point is that you were making a false analogy between prisoners and slaves. Good to see you think me pointing that out is a straw man argument.  Are you serious? I mean, wut?  Alright. All Humans in existence is one set. Okay. Good. Now, some humans are white. Some humans are Black. Does that mean that all whites are black?  Again: Some slaves are prisoners. Some slaves are just servile slaves. Does that make all servile slaves prisoners/criminals?   That was the straw man. Because I never inferred that at all.   &gt;See above. Also, your comparison of slavery to parenting is a terrible analogy because, again, the parents don't own the children, they are merely their caretakers. This is why if a child is abused by their parents they are taken away from them.  So then the Children are owned by the government, and entrusted with being cared for by the parents?  &gt;This is effectively what a butler or maid is, so yes. Even still, these people have the ability to resign from their obligations. Can any slave just decide to go it on their own?  Did you know that's what happened a lot in the OT of the Bible? There is a law that actually deals with people who willingly put themselves into slavery.   &gt; Also, please tell me where it says slaves can quit whenever they want in the Bible. Is it anywhere near where it tells masters how much they can beat them?  ""If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing."" Exodus 21:2  Next you will say, ""Well they have to serve 6 years before they can leave"". Well prisoners have to serve a sentence before they can leave. Military personel normally have to serve for a few years before they can leave:   ""When you joined the military, you signed a contract that committed you for a certain amount of time (usually 4 years of active duty, followed by 4 years of inactive duty). It's not McDonalds™. You can't simply quit anytime you want to.""   From: http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/faqdischarge.htm  **And then,** children are ""in the care of their parents"" until they are 18/whatever legal age of adulthood is in their area.   So, I ask again: what is the difference?",™

t5_2qhh9,jeannaimard,1366734880,"Pour bien mettre en perspective la toxicité du fluor, dans les années 60, la NASA étudiait une fusée pour aller sur Mars.

Le problème est que l’échappement était si polluant que pour que le lancement soit absolument sur, il devrait se dérouler dans une zone où il n’y aurait aucune autre activité humaine dans un rayon de 100 milles.  Ils ont décidé de regarder du côté des fusées nucléaires, c’est beaucoup plus sécuritaire (même si l’échappement est radioactif)…  Et c’est cette marde là qu’ils veulent câlisser dans notre eau, qui n’est bue qu’à 0.0001% (le reste sert à l’industrie, à se laver et flusher nos cacas).

If I had to I would say that it is more like soccer than football or maybe even more like rugby (at least from what I know about the game) without the contact.  I'll just copy and paste this entry from the [USA Ultimate website](http://www.usaultimate.org/about/ultimate/default.aspx)  ""Combining the non-stop movement and athletic endurance of soccer with the aerial passing skills of football, a game of Ultimate is played by two teams with a flying disc or Frisbee™ on a field with end zones, similar to football. The object of the game is to score by catching a pass in the opponent’s end zone. A player must stop running while in possession of the disc, but may pivot and pass to any of the other receivers on the field.  Ultimate is a transition game in which players move quickly from offense to defense on turnovers that occur with a dropped pass, an interception, a pass out of bounds, or when a player is caught holding the disc for more than ten seconds. Ultimate is governed by Spirit of the Game™, a tradition of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the players rather than referees. Ultimate is played in more than 42 countries by hundreds of thousands of men and women, girls and boys.""",™

t5_2cneq,InVultusSolis,1366744423,"&gt; the 2nd amendment has actually started to infringe on both the ""domestic tranquility"" and the ""general welfare"" goals.  So while we're changing the constitution because the world has changed so much, let's also revoke the 4th, 5th, and 6th amendments, because how are we going to fight terrorism if people hide behind things like rights?   &gt; Militias are no longer needed for ""common defence"" and guns don't contribute anything to any of the other desires of the founding fathers. So that part could go.   I missed that point in history where human nature changed and nations didn't invade other nations, or governments stopped spiraling downward into oppressive totalitarian regimes.  &gt; Because people live without them all over the world. That's how.  Which parts? The third world backwaters where the only people with the guns steal everyone else's food? The oppressive dictatorships where the populace has been forcibly disarmed because the government fears an armed revolt? Or ""first world democracies"" which have a decent social safety net, no War on Drugs™, universal health care, and aren't putting record numbers of their citizens in prison? The US is none of those places.  &gt; If we make the incentives high enough, people will come out more.   Who is going to pay for that number of buy-backs? Plus, at most you'd get low-hanging fruit. Most gun owners aren't going to turn in their $500 Glock or $1000 AR-15 for a $100 gift card.  &gt; Oh... so we should make drinking and driving legal again? Ok, but I don't want to live in your town then.   No. Drinking and driving is a crime like shooting someone: gross negligence or malicious intent. You're advocating that gun owners should all be punished as negligent or having malicious intent.  &gt; I'd like to see background checks for everyone having a gun.  Ok, fair enough. The US has an instant background check system for new purchases. How would you extend this to private sales that don't take place across state lines?   &gt; You would literally never be able to buy a gun without waiting a number of weeks. It would completely eliminate impulse buying.  Ok, this I have a problem with. What difference would that make at all? Are impulse buys of guns connected in any way whatsoever with gun homicides? And then there's the whole constitutionality issue. You're placing an undue burden on a constitutional right.  &gt; I'd like those background checks to be so in depth that they require not only personal references but a notarized note from a physician testifying to your mental stability.  I sense that the theme here is that you're trying to burden the process so much that most people wouldn't bother trying to get a gun. Not going to happen with the 2nd Amendment and the SCOTUS rulings in recent years. But for the purposes of discussion, what would the criteria be to be barred from buying a gun? The problem with things like ""personal references"" and ""exam by a physician"" is that the applicant is relying on many subjective pieces of information to pass the background check. If the process is relying on subjective information, then that's not guaranteeing equal protection for all people under the law. And, on top of everything else, this scheme would never pass a test of constitutionality. ",™

Also, these aren't the prices of the actual venue. Stub Hub ""Where fans buy &amp; sell tickets™"" ... in other words, scalpers buy as many tickets as they can during the presale, and hike up the prices and sell them here online. That's why all the prices here are different, and they have different amounts of tickets-- they are different people selling all of them. The original prices were $35 before it got sold out. Which is SUPER CHEAP for such popular bands!! The best way to go to a concert is to be able to jump on the fan presales before it gets sold out. Because popular bands get sold out within the hour of going on sale, usually.  Besides, their website says that this is an outdoor concert, so you don't have to worry about seating at all. ",™

t5_2qlve,dontthrowstones,1366762367,"&gt;Your culture is not under attack. Stop being so melodramatic.  Really? For example, I have yet to read something on this subreddit regarding Orangeism/Loyalism that has been met with positive comments from people outside of that culture.   To witness the unthinking insults that fly about this sub (and twitter, and whereever else) when someone mentions the word loyalist and then conclude that grouping is not the target of some form of aggression is pretty astounding to be perfectly honest. And that's before the media treatment is examined, when as the flags 'issue' proved, they're only interested in hearing Loyalists speak when they can report 'from the Frontline™'. But then, when leading journalists reporting on NI have a background in [extremist political parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McDonald_(writer) what do you expect but a 'war' right?  It may be a sham war, a 'war' designed to appease the revolutionaries and convince them they are making progress when they lost all hope of that the day they took their finger off the trigger, but a war it still is nonetheless.  &gt;The middle ground should piss everybody off  They singular failed to do that on the flags issue. Unless I missed their hard-hitting rebuke of Limavady Borough Council for failing to match Belfast's bold compromise...  &gt;The only people trying to wind up loyalists seem to be the DUP/uup and the PUP  Sure...  &gt;Sinn Fein offer genuine representation  Not at Westminster they don't. You haven't stated how any of the local parties offer anything better than what the likes of UKIP with it's UK-wide potential representation offer. I'm an opponent of UKIP but even I can see they're offering something coherent beyond clattering the Stormont begging bowl.  &gt;I am not a fan of either of them but they take care of issues for the Catholic working class much better than unionist parties take care of their supporters.  I like how this assumes you can take care of one religion's working class whilst not impacting the other. Please can you state in what way Catholic working class are benefiting directly from SF/SDLP instigated changes to the system which Protestant working class cannot take advantage of if they so wish.  It's clear many here have delusions of what certain parties are offering and 'achieving'.",™

t5_2cneq,JF_Queeny,1366766244,"&gt; Your contention that Bowman bought seed from a grain elevator sounds great the more you repeat it, but it's just not that simple. I've read the court documents.  Enlighten me.  Because I have read the court documents.  Would you like me to quote them to you?  He not only knew they were RoundupReady, he bragged about it to Monsanto.  *In 1999, Bowman also purchased commodity seed from a local grain elevator, Huey Soil Service, for a late-season planting, or “second-crop.” Because Bowman considered the second-crop to be a riskier planting, he purchased the commodity seed to avoid paying the signifi-cantly higher price for Pioneer’s Roundup Ready® seed. That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He confirmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator.* **Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.**  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf   So this isn't Monsanto 'picking' on the little guy.  He knowingly went out of his way to steal technology he didn't want or couldn't afford to pay for...and was dumb enough to brag about it.     ",®

t5_2qhh9,znuxor,1366775381,"This is probably not the most appropriate reddit for help concerning French, but I will have a go. I suppose those symbols means accents and other characters found in French.  &gt;Si je e’tais un pe\re  When your verb starts with a vowel (like e), you need to contract it this way (j'étais). Also, in your case, you don't need to mention ""un"" before père.  &gt;primie\re le©on  the correct way to write ""first"" is pr**e**mière.  &gt;...mais en essayant de faire le bien.  A more appropriate way to formulate this would be : ""...mais d'essayer de faire le bien.""  &gt;Vous ne pouvez pas toujours e”tre’ re’compe’nse pour faire le bien  In English, this would be translated to ""you can not always be rewarded for doing good"" While this could be correct, it may be better to write it in a future tense instead of a conditional one, like this: "" Vous n'allez pas toujours être récompensé pour avoir fait le bien."" You can also see that the end was changed because *good* is (usually) done before you get rewarded.  &gt;mais il est encore le plus important.  you could replace ""il"" by ""celui-ci"" or ""ce dernier""  &gt;La deuxie\me le©on serait qu’ils essaient des nouvelles choses parce que me”me si de nouvelles choses sont difficiles, on peut toujours apprendre d’eux.  ""nouvelles choses"" is there two times, you could get deducted points for that (I don't know if they do at your level). A way to solve this would be to replace the second ""nouvelles choses"" by ""ces dernières"". Additionally, using ""eux"" at the end is incorrect because ""chose"" is a *nom féminin* (sorry for the lack of translation here). Replace it with ""elles""  Apart from these mistakes, your text appears to be quite correct. Good luck on your exam!",©

That is, there is no light without darkness, there is no good without bad. I believe if god is omnipresent, god is duality. If god is good only, god is not omnipresent.

Lord of the Rings was actually filmed there and that is how they captured such raw essence in their movies. I would give anything to visit there and admire the beauty of the scenery, but I don't think I could ever camp there; it just seems like a living nightmare to me. Camping in New Zealand would require staying outside, at night, in the dark...where they filmed Lord of the Rings! That movie made 12-year-old me crap my pants with the monsters they had in it. Orcs and goblins..and old guys with beards walking around with giant glowing sticks. Also the giant flying bat-dragons with ghosts riding on them above everyone...not to mention a huge irritated eye in the center of it all that looks like he could use a swimming pool amount of Clear Eyes™ solution to help douse whatever allergic reaction he is having that day, only pissing him off even more to the point of delusion as he murders thousands just to find his wedding ring that he lost when he was ""doing the dishes"" the other night.

I'd love to see image stabilization applied to field glasses myself-as long as it works, and it's not a gimmick to sell low quality glass.  Also, yes, digital zoom is not the same as optical-and that's a good point. But ( and I may be biased here) I ID more birds with my Sony DSLR than with my field glasses-and that's by zooming in on the image either on camera or sometimes (if I want to compare several images) back on my laptop.  In any case, I'd want to try them out before buying, but it might be good. It also might suck.

t5_2vper,pbolo,1366826338,"	In this evaluation paper I will evaluate myself and what I learned in this class as well as what I did in this class to further my knowledge. This class really challenged me. Throughout the semester I found myself searching for new ways to learn information and learning about topics in which I had never even heard of. It was refreshing for my mind and I enjoyed being in charge of my own assignments. 	In the beginning of the semester I primarily focused on the readings and one big project that I did with 3 other members. For the project we worked on, we posted notes that we had made and used if we were actually presenting it to the class because I assumed we were making a video of the project being presented to the class. This didn’t end up being the case because we ran out of time so we just posted what we had which wasn’t bad but it wasn’t perfect either. The beginning readings definitely furthered my vocabulary I will admit to putting some of the words I read into dictionary.com. Though it was a bit difficult for me it was very beneficial to have to challenge myself. The topics were interesting and kept my attention.  	That was the beginning of the semester though and I’m supposed to reflect on the second half of the semester so here we go. I definitely think that the second half of the semester was better than the first half at least for me. There was a little bit more structure that wasn’t overbearing but kept us on course. I liked the activities that we did in class as well as updates we had to give you about projects.  	One day in particular that I really liked is when we did the anonymity debate. Although I didn’t go up and speak I gave many points and ideas to my team members and made our arguments stronger. It was great to be debating over anonymity because it was a topic that none of us had ever debated before. My group I believe did win the debate. ☺  	Another day that I really liked this semester was when we got into in class groups to think of a new project. My group came up with the Givmo bags. Emily Lopez actually thought of the idea and is still working on the project. After we had thought of our idea on the first day our goal for the next class period was to gather supplies and Givmo. So we went around campus on that next day and gave out Givmo bags and explained to people what Givmo was. I would say the project was very successful.  	Another area where I learned a lot was in badges. I had no idea what badges were or how to earn them. But now sometimes I earn them just for fun. It makes me feel important. Badges are a great way actually to learn and gain credibility on the Internet.  	There was another day in class where we had to get into groups and create our own app. My group came up with two ideas one better than the other. Our app was a destination app. Basically you get points for making it to places on the fastest route. The idea that I came up with for an app was called Captain Extrovert. In that app you have to go on adventures. You have to check at the most adventure destinations to become Captain Extrovert.  	I loved seeing all the videos of the new robots that people have made. We spent a day looking at those and discussing what they do. In my opinion robots are scary and could definitely take over the world if they become too prominent but it’s interesting to learn about them nonetheless. It is amazing how much they can do now and how human some of them look.  	Another cool day was when we learned all about gaming and how everything pretty much is a game. Some of the readings and videos that we had for class were crazy! There are so many games out there. Prime example would be Darfur is Dying. This game would be pretty offensive to some people but it is an actual game and there thousands just like it on the web. New ones being created everyday.  	For the second half of the semester I did some research on cameras being all around us. I was reading some of what popped up on my yahoo news feed and that topic came up I was instantly interested. It didn’t get much feedback on Reddit from my classmates. I think that the topic is so true and happens today in all of our lives. I think that we even had a class where we watch a video on someone ordering a pizza and that person on the other end of the phone knew everything about him. Anyways not to babble on about it but it is just so crazy how much people really know about us.  	I think that this class has definitely expanded my horizons. I have a more open view of how the learn now. I also learned so many new things about technology that I could never have learned on my own. This was a new perspective to learn from as well. Most of my classes are filled with communication major who have been taught to think a certain way. It was cool to get out there and learn from the other minds we have in the class. The format of things was also very new for me. It was challenging to get used to but in the end I think it was good for me to be responsible for my own work. I think that all in all this class was a success in furthering my knowledge. That is what school is for so hey win win.  ",☺

t5_2tnz9,lowkeyoh,1366843065,"But these pages aren't attempting to sell products and these sites aren't designed to be advertisements.  Not for the food, anyway.  Check out the Latino site, there's an ad for a wrap up top but other than that the entire site is dedicated to what McDonalds is doing for the Latino community.  Also there's this tidbit.  &gt;As a former educator, McDonald’s® franchisee Richard Castro from El Paso, TX, was keenly aware of the alarming number of Hispanic students who dropped out of high school in his hometown and across the country. Driven by his commitment to give back, Castro acted to change this trend by leading the effort to create a scholarship program that would serve as encouragement for young Hispanics to complete high school and continue their education.  &gt;Castro rallied his fellow McDonald’s franchisees and the McDonald’s Corporation and secured the support of Ronald McDonald House Charities to establish the RMHC®/HACER® program in 1985. An initial fund of $97,000 served to launch the program, providing $1,000 awards to high school seniors in various communities.   Of the seven banner ads I'm seeing on [The 365Black site](http://www.mcdonalds.com/365black/en/home.html) Only one of the banners the get cycle have anything that directly market products.  What it does have is information on what McD's is doing in the Black community as well as information about African-American scholarships and job opportunities.  In fact that's the only thing featured on the 365blacks extention.   All the other links just go back to the main site.   The Asian site recognizes both Pacific islanders as well as Indian cultures which almost never happens.  They promote their lecture circuit as well as, again, scholarships employment and franchising.   These pages aren't about chopping the brand into race specific segments, it's about demonstrating involvement and understanding of various communities and their values.  The site for Blacks focus on job creation and community participation, Latinos focuses on pride, and Asian on education.   So the bigger question is why bother?  Why spend the money on APA month, or on the Latin Grammys? Because participation in communities is just as important as the products you're selling these days.  To understand this let's take a look at Chick-Fil-A.  Now I don't eat at Chick-Fil-A any more due to the LGBT rights fiasco.  The problem isn't that I don't like their chicken sandwiches, I personally find them delicious,  it's that I can find other restaurants that don't come with the baggage of Anti-LGBT activism.  The corporate values played into my decision to visit a store.  Similarly, are you going to be more or less likely to support the store that sent your cousin to college?  A store that's owned by your neighbor?  Creates jobs in your neighborhood for your neighbors?  It can be seen as pandering, but who is is pumping money into communities?  ",®

Even as far back as OD&amp;D there were rules in place to prevent ""skill abuse"" (if you keep trying to kick down a door, or search for a secret passage, you'll burn up time on your torches and the random monster clock).  More importantly, though, your example can't work the way you say it does.  &gt; When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. ✴On a 10+, **the GM** will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. ✴On a 7–9, **the GM** will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.  The *player* cannot say any such thing with the mechanism of Spout Lore. Even if they could there's nothing stopping the GM from putting a trap on the door, or have the treasure been looted before the PCs arrive, if they think that would make for a more interesting game. DW in fact encourages it, and D&amp;D certainly doesn't forbid it, it just lends no guidance.  Discern Realities works the same way, too, so I'm not sure where you're getting this notion.",✴

t5_2x1lf,blitzballer,1366851161,"info:  In January 1996, nine-year-old Amber Hagerman was riding her bicycle on a warm Saturday afternoon when a neighbor heard the girl scream. The neighbor saw a man pull Amber off her bike at the closed-down Winn Dixie Store on Abrams Street, throw her into the front seat of his pickup truck, and drive away at high speed. The neighbor called Arlington, Texas police, and Amber's brother Ricky went home to tell his mother and grandparents what had happened. Donna Whitson, Amber's mother, called Amber's father Richard Hagerman at work, who rushed home. Richard Hagerman had seen Marc Klaas, Polly Klaas's father, on TV and contacted him, asking what to do, since Marc Klaas had experienced the same thing when Polly was abducted from her slumber party in California and then murdered by Richard Allen Davis, a convicted sex offender who was on parole.  At that time, Richard and Donna called the news media and the FBI. The Whitsons and their neighbors began searching for Amber. It was a cold winter that year and I (Bruce Seybert) was with a few people searching the Trinity River's bottom just north of Arlington with the others. Amber Hagerman was in Girl Scouts with my daughter, so this hit very close to home. I stopped in and talked with Donna and Richard and the grandparents, and helped deal with the press and news reporters.  During this time, neighbors and citizens of Arlington, Texas and all over the Dallas, Fort Worth Metroplex and Texas started a shrine at the abandoned Winn Dixie store near the loading dock where Amber Hagerman had been abducted. Four days later, a man walking his dog found her body in a storm drainage ditch. At that time, peoples' hearts fell out. The community mourned and questions turned to anger after the autopsy showed 9-year-old Amber Hagerman had been sexually assaulted, then murdered. At this, Donna and Richard Amber's parents started the Organization P.A.S.O., People Against Sex Offenders, Amber Hagerman. We ran P.A.S.O. out of my pickup truck with a camper shell on the back at the shrine at the abandoned Winn Dixie loading dock. We had freezing temperatures and even snow that year! We collected all the signatures we could to take to then-Governor George Bush Jr., for tougher laws to protect the children. During this time, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton called to express their feelings of sorrow and loss to Donna and Richard. They gave them the phone number to the Chief of Staff, and were assured if they called the President, their call would be returned within 24 hours! During this time, Governor George Bush Jr.'s office contacted us and conveyed that the Governor felt Texas had tough enough laws and all they needed was better enforcement. God's Place International Church then came forward after seeing us on the news working out of my pickup truck, and donated office space for us to use! After we had an office space for P.A.S.O. things began to grow and happen fast. The newspapers, live news on television and radio featured our cause in the news daily, trying to catch the killer of Amber Hagerman. I became the office manager, handled press releases and was the spokesman for P.A.S.O. We had Laurie, a computer genius, join us. Then AST Computers donated a computer system to P.A.S.O. and Microsoft donated software. Thus, learning how to use a computer began. Internet service was donated, so now knowledge was a click away! Since Governor Bush made it clear he was not going to do anything, we contacted then-Congressman Martin Frost, and, with Marc Klaas' help, we drafted the Amber Hagerman Child Protection act, which was signed into law October 1996 by President Bill Clinton. During this time Marc Klaas and I had talked about what needed to be done when Polly was abducted and what was not done. Thus the idea of the AMBER ALERT™ was born. ",™

And while some people do in fact post death stories of friends or family, true or not, for karma (which means **NOTHING**), I do believe you that you didn't have a shady motive for posting.  People shame those who talking about their passed loved ones, but it's my belief that they are just sharing their grief, and wanting to let others know of the impact their loved one made on you and the world. She will live forever in the people who hear her story and remember. And what better to place to share than here on Reddit.  That is a truly angelic photograph.

t5_2qh2p,watchmanforchrist,1366868246,"THE HOUR AND THE DAY HAS NOW BEEN REVEALED TO THE ANGELS OF GOD: AS I, THE MESSENGER ANGEL, ANNOUNCED THE BIRTH, SO I, GABRIËL, ANOUNCE YOU THE SOON RETURN OF YESHUA HAMASIACH, JESUS CHRIST! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome to this very important message, on January 16th, 2013!  Shalom, beloved prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, my name is Gabriël.  As I, the messenger angel, announced the birth, so I, Gabriël, announce you, the soon Return of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! I am the messenger angel of God, Hear, hear, hear! Behold, I am the voice crying - Gabriel, who cries in the universe and on the Earth: Prepare yourself!  Matthew 27, verse 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.  For three hours it was very dark.  Mark 15, verse 25 It was the third hour, and they crucified him.  Verily, Emanuel, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, He, the King of kings, who conquered death, is truly coming back very soon with might and power and glory!  Matthew 25, verse 13 Watch therefore, ""to you has been said"", added the messenger angel of God, for you don't know the day nor the hour.   The God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham has everything ready now.  Matthew 24, verse 27 For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.  Luke 17, verse 26 to 37 Read this aloud. Here it is written: As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all. It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. Remember Lot's wife! Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left. There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left. Two men shall be in the field; the one will be taken, and the other will be left."" They answering, asked him, ""Where, Lord?"" He said to them, ""Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.""   The messenger angel of God spoke further, Benjamin, those who are pure, let them rejoice and prepare! If you are firmly anchored to the world, and are one with the world, and not in Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, because of your sins, you will never get to see God's Kingdom! Choose, whom you want to serve today, and turn away from the world!  The hour and the day has now been revealed to the Son, and the angels of God! Nobody is allowed to take a part away from God's Words from the prophecy, and change it, only the Editor and Writer, God Himself!  Luke 17, verse 18, and Matthew 24, verse 12 and 13 Here it is written: Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?  Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, Jesus, Yeshua, is coming very soon now!  Hebrews 13, verse 15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  John 3, verse 7 and 8 and 16 Here it is written: Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again. The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Read also aloud: 1 John 2, verse 4 to 6 Here it is written: One who says, ""I know him,"" and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him. But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most assuredly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him: he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Benjamin, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, is already for so long homesick for His children, and has given so many opportunities to the world! But what opportunity do they give Him? When He comes,.......   PLEASE, SEND ME AN EMAIL FOR THE COMPLETE TEXT.",©

I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, Benjamin, look up, then you'll see it.  You're seeing many people, sitting before the television; they are being brainwashed. This is very normal nowadays. Everything, about which one formerly dared to say nothing, has now become already normal and acceptable for conversation. Nothing is still taboo now! In the beginning one is still getting a blush, and one is still shocked by it. But by looking at it again and again, one gets used to it, and in the end it is accepted as normal.    Read aloud: 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 7 and verse 3 Here it is written: For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.  And verse 3 Here it is written: Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, I reveal to you: On May 5th, 2013, the kingdom of darkness will expand even more! It's your choice whether you'll listen. Two things can happen: either you'll do nothing, and then will be influenced by the kingdom of darkness and be taken over, or you'll take action in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.

t5_2qnp7,munky9001,1366902376,"&gt; Could any of you answer me a few questions about the field and where you work? Within reason, of course, don't want to make anyone break any rules of employment.  Just ask the questions. Have us all answer and then cherry pick the responses you like and pretend its all the same person.  So here's my background. I got my first linux cd in around 2003 or so basically the last Red Hat or so. I munky'd around with that but never really got a final install of it anywhere. Few years later I got another computer and started messing around with early ubuntu and I even got an install of it. Eventually I just setup random shit for fun and became a pretty good newbie linux admin.   I joined the military; did something stupid and got myself disabled; they paid for rehabilitation and school. I went to post-2ndary on their dime and generally speaking I taught my teacher tricks because I'd pirated the microsoft stack to teach myself; taught myself programming in the basic languages but during school since i wasnt learning anything I taught myself C, C++, python, php, etc etc; generally didnt learn anything there from them though.   Job I got right out of school was a run of the mill linux/network admin for an isp. I generally work my ass off and in that job I put in 60hr weeks whereas I was salary barely making above minimum wage. I didnt care because I wanted to earn my stripes but then the boss started making outrageous rules that basically banned breaks, lunch, no paid overtime etc etc. Assistant manager said enough was enough and said friday he's quitting. Boss fired him on thursday. Half the staff quit at the same time.  Job after that I interviewed for was explained to me to be a sr sysadmin type position but it was a small mom-pop and the place only had 1 competent guy and the rest of the guys... you cant imagine how they manage to breath. However that competent guy on multiple occasions right from the get-go challenged me multiple times and I proved I was right and he was wrong. The first time it happened he said, 'its alright with being wrong... so long as i dont do it often.' but when I did it a couple more times he got extremely defensive and started attacking me. Then again day 2 I knew I wanted to quit the place. The office was open concept and the boss would walk by you 3 times an hour minumum to make sure you were working. You couldnt do anything but work... surf the net? Absolutely not. Listen to music with headset on? absolutely not. ""You are paid to watch progress bars."" Literally when she said that I almost walked out that second. Add in lots of illegal behaviours. That job didnt last.  Then I got my current job. The business consists of 4 sides; appliances for environmental monitoring, web developer, a network monitor, and MSP. I was friends with practically everyone in this place except there was issues. Web Developer's wife just finished becoming a full nurse and she was going to make epic loads more then he ever could but they had to move. So he left. 1 of the MSP guys got a pro-vmware position with a cruise ship and his first major job was VDI deployment. The network monitor guys basically saw the prices of telecommuting to San Fran businesses. Make $80k with them which is massive money in my area but like minimum wage in san fran. So huge deal there and flipside federal government just laid down a huge tax on software development... so they took those jobs. Basically the remaining staff was extremely stressed. So I got the job and I blew away the msp side so well that profits came in massively. In addition because of my previous employments I wanted to be legal, ethical, and provide a service that absolutely shames these previous employers. Though we do tend to rob peter to pay paul for the other sides of the business. Web development is dead as per my arguments; it's absolutely stupid to webdev or even host because soon™ ipv6 will be around and IP based attacks will convert to DNS and websites are going to be smoked.  Environmental monitoring stuff we've actually spread out beyond IT industry and are destroying the food industry. The owners absolutely love the fact that they can look up and see their fridges and freezers are the right temp etc etc.  Networking monitoring largely has been fed by MSP side to provide features that our MSP side wants. So for example when I get a new customer that isnt like 10 computers. I toss a network monitor on that network and I can then have a debian box on that network that gives me all the networking tools I could ever want. In addition I can pretty much see problems before they happen. The next release of my network monitor though is going to autoconfigure. It'll just try snmp v2 public string by default; start monitoring and recording standard information. Basically it's putting my poor interns out of a job hah.  On the MSP side; we blow away our customers with our uptime and lack of problems. Though this has now on multiple occasions made them ask 'So why do we still need you anymore?' and we just refresh their memory on how it was before us. I also tend to notice user's expectations become so high after such good uptime that they tend to get overly frustrated by some random little problem. So they'll go to some random website and itll be down and they get so mad that its down and we need to fix it... or some picture someone sent them is too small so we have to make their resolution bigger so they can see it. It's extremely frustrating when the users have unfixable problems and they are frustrated with you.",™

Atheists aren't interested in mutable truth. Atheists by and large are interested in provable fact. Your truth in particular is unsupported and unproven.   &gt; You say it's ignorance.  No, we say it's delusion or clinging to fantasy.

t5_2qj8f,blahable,1366906926,"&gt; is it inappropriate for me to point out that they have wasted their time and money, and put their faith in charlatans whose practices have little or no basis in science and even less good evidence of effectiveness?   Even if you did just tell them, do you think it would change anything?  Most CAM practitioners tell their clients not to trust established science-based medicine.  They tell them that the doctors and Big Pharma™ are purposely making/keeping them sick so they can profit off them indefinitely and that conventional medicine doesn't work and is extremely dangerous.  They then talk about how long CAM has been used by humans compared to science-based medicine and how CAM is totally safe and natural and can cure every aliment under the sun.  They are literally indoctrinating these people on a daily basis with woo.   So, the only way a doctor can combat this nonsense fear-mongering is to be willing and able to put in just as much effort trying to (re)educate their patients as the CAM practitioners spend lying to them.  You would probably need to make some very well constructed pamphlets with dozens of studies showing that CAM (mostly) doesn't work and that it can be dangerous.  Explain how there's no such thing as subluxations and there's no possible mechanism that allows chiropractic to work.  Show them how homeopathic drugs are made so they can see that they are literally 100% water which can't possibly work.  Cite a couple of the studies that show acupuncture to be no better than placebo.  The only way to be able to do this in a timely fashion is with a pamphlet that your patients can take home and read or with a PDF pamphlet that you can email to them.   ",™

t5_2qh36,twanvl,1366907477,"I think that what I am trying to say is that there is an isomorphism (using agda notation):      iso₁ : ∀ A B → ∃ \Residual → List (Either A B) ↔ Σ (List A × List B) Residual  but not      iso₂ : ∀ A B → ∃ \Residual → List A × List B ↔ Σ (List (Either A B)) Residual  and in that sense `List (Either A B)` is larger than `List A × List B`.  As for a proof of this claim. The existence of `iso₁` can be shown by taking the residual to be a value that indicates how the As and Bs are to be mixed      data Mixing : ℕ → ℕ → Set where       [] : Mixing 0 0       inj₁∷_ : ∀ {m n} → Mixing m n → Mixing (suc m) n       inj₂∷_ : ∀ {m n} → Mixing m n → Mixing m (suc n)      mix : (xs : List A × List B) → Mixing (length (proj₁ xs)) (length (proj₂ xs)) → List (Either A B) where     mix ([] , []) [] = []     mix (x ∷ xs , ys) (inj₁∷ ms) = inj₁ x ∷ mix (xs , ys) ms     mix (xs , y ∷ ys) (inj₂∷ ms) = inj₂ y ∷ mix (xs , ys) ms          -- etc.  But I am not sure how to prove the non-existence of `iso₂`. I believe it would follow from parametricity. Essentially, any function from `List (Either A B)` can only look at the structure of the `List` and of the `Either`, not at the values. And now suppose that there are 2 As and 1 B for the backwards part of the isomorphism. There are `6*residual` such inputs which will be projected to just 2 possible outputs. This is impossible to do in a bijection. The only possible way to encode the input as a pair of lists would be to use longer (or shorter) lists of As and/or Bs. But then these lists need to contain duplicates (if they are longer) or discard values (if they are shorter). But discarding or duplicating values is not possible if you want to keep a bijection and not look at the values. I am not sure how to prove this more formally, though.",↔

t5_2qh1a,TIAFAASITICE,1366910691,"&gt;  A VM is the same as creating a ""physical virtual capture net"" to drape over the black box  Not really. A VM is an emulator that runs in the software domain. The black box would have direct contact with your physical graphics card, passing the frames directly to it for decoding and then from there to a screen of some kind.  So if you'd opt to go the VM route you'd have to implement the black box and, given the state of non-commercial VMs, that seems unlikely to happen.  &gt; Either way, you are just reading the output after it comes out of the black box and sent to a standard analog (or raw unencrypted digital video) signal  Rather, the black box would interface directly with the frame decoder on your graphics card which would in turn interface directly with your graphics output. In turn, it would most likely require you to use a separate layer of DRM to communicate with an approved™ screen.  I would think it's possible to implement the black box or somehow extract the keys from it. But at the same time I would expect it to be 'easier' to intervene in the connection between the graphics card and the screen.  Either way, I'd find it more likely that a keyset would be found, like in the past¹, for some part of the chain rather than someone emulating the whole thing.  ¹: [HDCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection#Master_key_release), [AACS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System#Cryptanalysis)",™

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup™, the herbicide used on Roundup Ready™ crops genetically engineered (GE) to withstand glyphosate. Glyphosate residues of up to 4.4 mg/kg have been detected in stems, leaves and beans of glyphosate-resistant soy, indicating metabolism of the herbicide.

MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE VERY SOON RAPTURE NOW! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On April 8th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, the Son of the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. My name is Rafaël.  When you are being taken away by God's enormous power, you are clothed in shiny linen. It feels more comfortable than a spacesuit. When you are being pulled through the air, up through the air, God will show you yet once, how beautiful and large the Earth was. It goes very fast! That great power snatches you so away, up! It's the most beautiful moment of your life.  You'll see all those beautiful colors and all those people, verily, even animals! Those are not dressed in bright linen, but God will bring them home safely. You will be amazed about what you'll see around you! Even babies and people with disabilities will go to Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  The beauty of the Earth will change immediately after the snatching away. Smoke and fire will be seen, after you are seeing yet just briefly your beautiful Earth at a distance. On the Earth there will be a worldwide earthquake, and the trumpets will be heard by many. Even the deaf will hear it, who are connected in Yeshua HaMashiach. The trumpet of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, will cause by the sound, the vibration on Earth. Then there will be chaos.     Of alien planets has already been revealed to you, Benjamin Cousijnsen, that the Earth was not the only planet with life.  On arrival, it will be very moving! The blind can see, the lame can walk, and the deaf can hear. Even all the pains and diseases are no more, and even arms and legs have grown back!  Read aloud: Jeremiah 32, verse 27, and Revelation 11, verse 12, 1 John 2, verse 15 to 16, and 1 John 4, verse 7 to 12 Jeremiah 32, verse 27 Here it is written: Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too wonderful for me?  Revelation 11, verse 12 Here it is written: I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, ""Come up here!"" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.  1 John 2, verse 15 to 16 Here it is written: Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.  1 John 4, verse 7 to 12 Here it is written: Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God. He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love. By this was God's love revealed in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.  Verily, Benjamin saw many images... Benjamin saw many crying of joy when they arrived there, with Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Doors opened; there was a hall, where many angels of God were among the guests.  Verily, get yourself ready for the strong, powerful snatching away! Be pure in heart, soul and body, and choose Him now today, and bring your sins to Him. He has called you today, and he who does not want to hear, will perish. Do not stay behind!  Behold, I come very soon! Thus speaks the Lord. Ruacha, Jeshu, Emanuel, Maranatha, Shalom",©

ONLY AS A BORN AGAIN ADULT IN CHRIST JESUS WILL YOU HAVE SALVATION! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello! On November 23rd, 2012, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the mighty name above all names, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Rafael. Verily, verily, I tell you this, listen carefully to what message I bring you this day.  Galatians 2, verse 7 and 8 But to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Gospel for the circumcision for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles.  Benjamin, many people think, because they read the Bible, and by doing many good deeds, and by being religious, they are able to go to heaven. And others say: Such a place doesn't exist. And they hope and believe in the lies of satan, and think that the many good works are being weighed on a scale, together with their evil deeds, and if it's a bit more the good, I'll also come there, they think, whether they are a christian or not.  God himself will puncture your balloon... boom! And everything is gone.  Romans 6, verse 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Romans 3, verse 23 to 30 For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance; to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.   Verily, I tell you, If you are born again as an adult, and make your choice for 100% for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and walk with Him, and bring all your sins under repentance to Him, then He has forgiven you all the sins, all! And He will say: Go and sin no more, and maintain your faith and go to a full evangelical church. You will be built up there, where one believes.  Ephesians 4, verse 11 to 16 you may read yourself.  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3, verse 18 He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  There are only 2 ways: HEAVEN and HELL. The choice is yours, whether He later has to make His choice for you. And then you'll say, ""It's true! Take me out of there!"" Then He will say to you: He who did not want to hear, will be lost. Once again I tell you, Repent and be saved! Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, cares about you, more than vice versa.  Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, I'm going again and tell you in the love of Christ, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!",©

Beloveds in Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, verily, you who’re listening, Time is up, over! Unexpectedly you will be snatched away, who truly have accepted Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.

O woe, you unbelievers, a global landslide, volcanic eruptions, Rome will be destroyed!, America will be no more!, and North and South Korea and China will go to war! Many missiles will then be fired with toxic gases. O woe, you left behinds! You yourself will go beat your breast, and say: ""If only we had listened to the messages of Benjamin, God's beloved prophet, and taken seriously!"" There will be complete chaos.    Just before all these events, you, who are in Jesus Christ, will have been taken away, snatched away. In the past Benjamin Cousijnsen saw even animals and babies, and people with a disability, be taken away.  Verily, if there is chaos and many disasters through the 'Rapture', there will be space ships, which make themselves visible, even those that were already there. They will say to you: ""We are the visitors from space, we have delivered you from your tumor, the haters. They have not been raptured, like these Christians claim; we have taken them away from you. We have delivered them from you, but we will help you, in order to rebuild the Earth."" Verily, verily, I tell you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ's name, these ‘visitors from space’ are the fallen angels!  The Lord has already revealed a lot to prophet Benjamin. I advise you to go listen to all his messages and to go spread them. My name is Supisadda. Verily, now is the time to open your mouth, and to save many souls in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ's name. Refer to the messages of God.  Do you still have to change something in your life? Do that! But also, as is described here: haughtiness, uncleanness, sorcery, lovelessness, stubborn, unbelieving, fornication, idolatry, bondage, addiction, envy, evil speaking and gossip, own ego, and many more... Examine yourself in the silence and bring everything to the cross of Golgotha, to Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach. Choose this day whom you want to serve.

WHERE’S YOUR FAITH GONE, THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN A CONQUEROR IN HIM? Please share and do not change © BC           Full view:  Hello, welcome! On April 15th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.   Shalom! I greet you in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  Verily, verily, I tell you, What blood type do you have?  John 3, verse 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, the precious Blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is His sacrifice to you. A love that goes so far, that He gave His Blood and shed it, in order to save you on the cross of Golgotha. For…, Oh, how mighty and powerful, and so wonderful, is the Blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! By His Blood, many have been saved, because He took all guilt upon Himself: all the sins! He was looking for you. Let us bow down to Him, to express honor.  Read aloud: Romans 3, verse 21 to 26, and 1 Corinthians 11, verse 23 to 34 Romans 3, verse 21 to 26  Here it is written: But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction, for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance; to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.  1 Corinthians 11, verse 23 to 34  Here it is written: For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.” In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body. For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged. But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another. But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Acts 20, verse 26 and 27  Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men, for I didn’t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.  Oh, how wonderful is Jesus' Blood, oh, how wonderful is Jesus' Blood. The devilish power has been broken by His power. Oh, how wonderful is Jesus' Blood.  Read aloud: Deuteronomy 12, verse 15 to 16 and verse 23 to 25 Deuteronomy 12, verse 15 to 16  Here it is written: Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. And verse 23 to 25  Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.  You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, the Blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, who loves you, has delivered you from sin and redeemed you! Where’s your faith gone, that you are more than a conqueror in Him?  Read aloud: Revelation 12, verse 11 to 12, and John 14, verse 6, and John 3, verse 18 Revelation 12, verse 11 to 12  Here it is written: They overcame him because of the Lamb’s blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn’t love their life, even to death. Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time. John 14, verse 6  Here it is written: Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.” John 3, verse 18  Here it is written: He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, I am the messenger angel of God; my name is Zuani.  Verily, consider: Ephesians 4, verse 17 to 20  Read this for yourself.  Repentance is to turn to God, and to confess and trust - 100 percent - that you have received forgiveness through Him. Invite Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, in your heart and life, Amen! Prophet Benjamin, the punishment because of sin, that punishment, He bore, Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach, even unto death. And also death could keep Him no longer bound. His love lifts you up. This I say to you who’s listening: He’ll set you free too. So He also overcame death, and is risen and alive! I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!",©

I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Rinearinda. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Mark 3, verse 23   And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can satan cast out satan?  Verily,  Luke 10, verse 18  And he said unto them, I beheld satan, ""in Hebrew: baraq, spoke the angel of the Lord"", as lightning fall from heaven.  2 Corinthians 11, verses 14 and 15  And no wonder, for ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord,"" even satan masquerades as an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ""taken over, the angel of the Lord said,"" ministers also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.  Isaiah 14, verse 12 to 14  How you have fallen from Heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! ""You play a game with the world! spoke the angel of the Lord"". You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!”  Verily,  Matthew 24, verse 25 to 26  Behold, I have told you beforehand. If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the desert,’ ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord"", don’t go out; ‘Behold, he is in the inner chambers,’ ""this chameleon, said the angel of the Lord"", don’t believe it. ""It is satan personally! said the angel of the Lord"". Matthew 24, verses 27 and 28  For as the lightning, ""Barack Obama, spoke the angel of the Lord"", comes forth from the east, and shines even unto the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures be gathered together.  Verily, Obama came from the East, in order to make a career, and this is now the fallen lightning! In secret much is prepared now, so that one will assume the ‘solution’ of Obama en masse and with open arms: the number of the beast, 666! Also, many gallows for the FEMA camps has been transferred worldwide, from America, signed by… Obama!   Also, the New World Order has had meetings worldwide, together with the royal house and some of the government and other leaders! Verily,  James 5, verse 7 to 9  Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, ""blow not along with all winds. Truly, he is the prophet! spoke the angel of the Lord"", for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.   Verily, you there, Jesus Christ has everything ready for His children already. The God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham has indicated, that His Son will soon know the point of time and the hour!   Matthew 11, verse 28  Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.  Benjamin, January 30, you become older.

Benjamin, once there has been spoken a prophetic message over your life: ‘You will be a hero’. Wake up now. Immediately I reacted and I got up... ""Can my wife come along too?"" I asked. ""The previous day my wife had indicated, she wanted once to come along. She also would like this very much"", I said. The angel said: Hero of God, she cannot bear this. But it won’t be for long anymore, and then she will see God, with you and many others. You may see God's abomination, hero of God. ""No, for me no scary things"", I said in the street...

Because I heard beautiful bird sounds, even I could hear the splashing of flowing water. Benjamin, it is beautiful here, isn’t it? ""Yes, really beautiful! This, I find relaxing"", I said. I have a gift for you, said the angel, this really belongs to you! I thought of everything, even of money. Look once behind this bush! I went over, pulled the bush aside, and what I saw then... I was very surprised!  ‘That looks like a time machine’, I thought, and immediately the angel said: This is a time machine! Step inside. I thought, ‘I wished my wife was with me’. Then I saw appearing a smile on the face of the messenger. ""How does this work?"" I asked. The angel of the Lord pushed down lever of some kind. I heard the angel yet calling the final words: Benjamin, travel well!  I saw consecutive events around me, which alternated with each other... It was enormous and in 3D. This, while the time machine vibrated - compare it to the movie ‘The Time Machine’ - only this was much more impressive.       The Lord showed me future images... I saw the dead, who were removed from the freezer, in order to move body parts into another man, or was it a robot? Because I saw an open chest with a red, yellow and blue wiring, lying on the operating room.  A moment later I saw a dark room, where satan and his demons were sitting at the table. They talked and they gossiped about someone; it appeared to be Jesus Christ. It was a meeting.  I saw that some churches were being destroyed by tornadoes, but some churches had a blood red cross sign on their doors. They were protected by the Blood of the Lamb, Jesus Christ. These churches had hardly any damage.  I saw a plane disaster, from which the pilot had suddenly disappeared, along with some travelers. This aircraft crashed. An explosion followed.  Elsewhere everything was falling out of the air... I saw a helicopter, crashing into a skyscraper. I became very afraid of what all I had seen. But I hardly felt fear when the angel sat suddenly beside me, and said: Fear not! I have come in God's joy, in order to refresh you. The angel said, Romans 15, verse 32 I asked, ""What is written there?"" The same, what I already said, and more, said the angel.  I saw people screaming in panic, crying and walking around infatuated in the church, because people had just suddenly disappeared. I saw a father, left behind, whose wife, daughter and baby had disappeared; at one time they were gone! I heard a voice saying: All things shall perish, Benjamin, God speaks: 2 Peter 3, verse 11 to 15 This spoke the King of kings, He himself spoke it.  I saw images of burning cars... I saw a mother with a photo frame in her hand, and she held it against her; she was confused while walking through the streets. There was a great confusion among the people! I saw a priest, who was trampling his own pack of cigarettes, and he said: ""He who commits sin, is of the devil! I was wrong!"" he said regretfully. ""I should have pondered 1 John 3, verse 6 to 10 better!""  ""What kind of disaster were these?"" I asked the angel of God. These are the signs of God, the angel answered, what shall be done. Not in order to scare the people, but to shake them awake. Repent, get yourself ready! said the angel. Come to Jesus Christ, He has been calling you for so long already! the angel cried. Take this message seriously. Make your choice now, while you still can, or go lost: for or against Jesus Christ,… eternal pain, hell, that you do not need to experience today yet, or do you choose heaven, where Jesus Christ awaits you, with His love and peace? Where there is never pain! Make the choice now, before it’s too late, or you will be left behind in the end time, in which you certainly don’t want to be, because it will be unbearable!      Suddenly the time machine, that I was sitting in, stood still... it stopped in front of our home. Benjamin, hero of God, how did you like it? ""Leave that ‘hero’ out,"" I smiled, ""what I saw, was very shocking!"" Arriving at the bed room, the angel said: Benjamin, had Marta still wanted to come along? ""Yes,"" I said, ""but not with anything like that, because everything I've seen today, like this, is too serious."" Just tell her, that there will come a big feast... the King is coming! ""I hear this very often,"" I said. The angel said: Look, what I showed you. Look at this world today. Soon the clock will be ticking no longer, because those who have accepted Christ, will hear no time and no ticking anymore. They will rejoice in Him, who is coming very soon.  Then the angel said, while I was in bed again: Jesus Christ is with you, He protects and blesses you. And he who does not want to listen to you with God's message, and does not take this seriously, will perceive it, when Jesus, the King, comes. Sleep well, and make no noise, otherwise your wife will awake. Suddenly the angel of God was gone, and I had to recover from all that I had seen and heard. I went downstairs momentarily, in order to write down everything again, what I have heard and seen literally.  Shalom! ",©

From my own experience with my husband's family, I can tell you if you decide to stay with Mark, you're going to have to be fully on board with taking care of Matt. If you go at it begrudgingly than you are just going to wind up resenting Mark for putting you in this situation. That's not to say that you just give in to Mark's every demand about his cousin. A relationship is about compromise and if you are willing to compromise on the situation with Matt than Mark should be willing to work with you to figure out a way for both of you to be able to work through this. He shouldn't be telling you that this is what he is going to do and if you don't like it then you can leave. I would not blame you in the least if you walked away from this situation. Hell, if my husband did something like this to me and was completely unwilling to work with me, I think that would be a deal breaker for me too. You're young and your whole life is in front of you.

t5_2qh41,girlie25,1366933178,"Berlin is a great place to visit. Just finished a month-long European trip after living in Edinburgh, Scotland for the past year. Went from Edinburgh   ✈ Berlin ✈ Rome ^train Florence ^train Milan ✈ Barcelona ^train Madrid ✈ Paris ^train London ✈ US.   We were able to do it all for extremely cheaply by using budget airlines (Ryan Air and Easy Jet) and traveling via train whenever it was easier/cheaper. We also stayed exclusively at Airbnb rentals which saved us a TON of money and gives you a totally unique experience in each city.   On top of visiting the other cities previously mentioned, I highly recommend visiting Amsterdam as it is definitely my most favorite European city. Also, Berlin has fantastic free walking tours as do most European cities. Just do a google search for them as you arrive in the city as they are mostly on a first come first serve basis. You usually just leave a small tip at the end for whatever you feel the tour was worth.   If you want to read more details about my trip and other places I recommend in Berlin and Europe as a whole, you can read my travel series I wrote [here] (http://www.sandiegoreader.com/staff/natalie-thomas/).

Those opinions even come to the point of dehumanization when they are directed at a group of people, with the distinction of this group oftentimes being completely arbitrary (religious people, cops).   The missing element is perspective. What might seem to most people to be complete non-issues or important but immediately unconcerning problems are to this narrow visioned model individual (smugly, we might call this individual *homo-reddicus*) a serious threat to personal liberty, and such should be argued with zeal.   *Homo-reddicus*, who spends hours organizing secret online anti-circumcision vigilante groups, who earnestly debates the merits of communist revolution in the United States, who talks about the tyrannical  overreach of an out of control federal government, and who angrily decries all other hermeneutic spaces as against the principles of *logic and reason™* is probably someone who just needs to go outside for a while.

t5_2va9w,Tepoztecatl,1366939039,"&gt;If the dude get's mad about it at the end then yeah I'd say he's feeling pretty entitled.  Entitlement, as defined by MW: ""belief that one is deserving of or entitled to certain privileges"".  If they felt entitled to anything, they wouldn't actually do things for girls to like them. I'd be surprised if all these guys' wanted was sex, but seeing the examples of ""friend-zoned"" guys, who seem to do all this cliche romantic stuff for girls they like, I'm willing to bet most of them want relationships and not just sex. They're confused as to what women want in a man, because women can't seem to come to terms with the idea that they want a confident, independent man that lives his own life and chooses when and how to include women in those plans.   Instead, pop culture has told us that what women want is a sensitive, caring man, that is not afraid to show his emotions and tries to comply with the woman's wishes as much as possible. Confident and attractive men don't really have to worry about this since they have a pool of women to choose from, all of which are ready to start a relationship with them, regardless of their initial attitude (remember that there are a lot of friend-zoned girls too!). After all, he can change later, or if he doesn't, they just break up and the thing ends right then and there.  &gt;Pretty sure what's happening is that the Nice Guys™ aren't meeting the woman's standard of nice, nothing to do with lying to themselves about who's an asshole and who's not.  I agree! And that's easily remedied. Decide what the standard of nice is, publish it as a manifesto and let them all know at once, so they stop bringing you flowers at midnight for your birthday, compliment your photos on facebook and hold your bags when you go shopping.   Too many men do not understand what being nice actually is, because they've been confused by all this culture surrounding relationships and courting, and also women that are not being completely honest with themselves when dealing with what they're attracted to.",™

WE PROTECT NOBODY; YESHUA HAMASIACH, JESUS CHRIST IS DOING THAT! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Shalom, welcome! on March 20th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am the messenger angel of God, Benjamin, and my name is Leobea.  Beloved, you have not chosen Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. He has chosen you for the great yield, a yield that goes beyond your understanding.  Make haste, time is up! Soon I will fly, fly out!  1 Corinthians 9, verse 16 to 19, and Romans 1, verse 8 and 9, Matthew 24, verse 12 to 14, and 1 Peter 4, verse 4 to 6, and Romans 1, verse 16 Read this aloud. 1 Corinthians 9, verse 16 to 19 Here it is written: For if I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Gospel. For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Gospel, I may present the Gospel of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Gospel. For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.  Romans 1, verse 8 and 9 Here it is written: First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers.  Matthew 24, verse 12 to 14 Here it is written: Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved. This Gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.  1 Peter 4, verse 4 to 6 Here it is written: They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming: who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For to this end was the Gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit Romans 1, verse 16 Here it is written: For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.  Verily, you there, listen! We angels are sent forth in order to save many. Some say: ""I have a feeling that an angel protects me."" We protect nobody, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is doing that. The honor and glory belongs to Him!  Verily, you who're listening, listen! Pray and you shall receive.  Matthew 7, verse 8 to 9 Read this aloud. Here it is written: For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened. Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?  If you confess your sins, and you truly regret, and invite Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, in order to come and live in your heart, He will enter in. I'm going now, and listen to the messages. The Lord wants to bless you! Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM! The Lord bless you ",©

On December 9th, 2012, the messenger angel of God brought on this prophetic message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Regintias. Olá, Benjamin and you there, Hear!  Verily, Oh woe world, you did not want to hear, and not for long anymore, then you will wail, because the Day of the Lord has come! He who has accepted Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, will be taken away.  In these days also strange events will occur, one follows the other... An angel of God will report, because the stars and the constellations of heaven do not shine their light. The Sun, which is low, will cause large problems around the world. Thereafter the Sun will obscure at sunrise, because the world loved the works of darkness, even the kids! The Moon does not let shine its light, then evil will come over the wicked.   Isaiah 13, verse 5 They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. Isaiah 13, verse 6 Wail; for the day of the LORD is at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. Isaiah 13, verse 7 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt  Psalm 1, verse 6 For the LORD the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked shall perish.

Not choosing for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, means that you are delivered to the kingdom of darkness! A Jew or Greek or Spaniard, or you who are listening, can be even more cocky than a donkey or a bull! At the moment your children, or your husband or wife, or your mother or father, and so on, are gone, there will be much weeping, heartbreak! You will beat your breast, for they have been raptured: these Christians. Verily,  Daniel 12, verse 13 But go you your way until the end be; for you shall rest, and shall stand in your lot, at the end of the days.  Make your choice, bend your knees and close your eyes, then say: ""Lord Jesus Christ, I open my heart to you, and ask you to wash me, whiter than snow. Forgive all my sins. I surrender to you now, and will go to the full evangelical church, in order to be built up. At this moment I believe that I am free and that I am your child, and am covered under the precious Blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Thank you, that I may go along with you to the heavenly home, and that I don't stay behind, but may be with you, where is eternal life. No tears, no pain, but everlasting gladness, Amen!""  John 3, verse 36 He that believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

t5_2wgat,wcmbk,1366953246,"**Chapter 1**  Marvin Mange was no ordinary man. Every day he lived with a secret, which if exposed to the world threatened to tear his life apart. For Mr Mange could speak to animals, kind of like Harry Potter but instead of just snakes it was every animal. The way it happened was also different to Harry Potter.   As a young boy Marvin was abandoned as a child, leaving him to fend for himself, alone. As people are difficult to understand as a toddler, he made the life-changing decision to journey into the wilderness. ""Alas,"" Marvin said (although as a toddler, it was much less sensical). ""People are difficult to understand as a toddler, so I will make the life-changing decision to journey into the wilderness.""  This simple step, innocuous as it may seem, would change the rest of Marvin's life. Marvin gathered up his petty belongings - a rattle, some nappies (reusable obviously, cause there aren't any shops in the desert) and his sole connection with his parents; a shaky drawing on the box of a McDonalds Happy Meal^®.   He then got to the wilderness, which wasn't just any wilderness, but the wildest wilderness of them all - the Australian wilderness, colloquially referred to and hereafter named ""The Outback"". The Outback contains such unspoken horrors that any man who was not immediately killed by its collection of spiders, snakes or dropbears, would surely go mad of fright. Luckily, Marvin was no man. He was a baby.   Slowly but surely, he set about introducing himself to the local fauna. He began copying the snakes hiss, the spiders silence, and the dropbear's trademark SNAAAARWAKAWAKAWAKA^TM. He mastered every detail of their language, whilst hiding in the shadows, out of any suspecting eye's sight. Snakes don't have great vision though, so it's honestly not that impressive. After what seemed like months, but through authorial omission could be minutes, Mr Marvin Mange felt he had mastered every element of the bush language.   But suddenly, a new challenger appeared - the kookaburra! This bird, a scruffy little fella, is known as ""that bastard bird"" to the locals, due to its sinister laugh and mischievous ways. Because he was a bird and can see stuff from above, he spied our little hero almost instantly. Down he flew, like a bat out of hell - but a bird and in The Outback.  ""Hey there Marvin."" the bird said.  ""How did you know my name?"" our protagonist gasped.   ""You mentioned it whilst imitating the snake, plus it's written on your belongings so it's really quite obvious."" the kookaburra said cunningly.   ""Oh alright then, that's cool.""  ""Yeah. So would you like to become a real master of the animal tongue?""  ""That sounds pretty good, but there aren't any ironic tricks involved are there?"" Marvin asked.  ""Nope."" the evil bird replied. There were.  **Chapter 2**  ""Wow, that's great! Through that teaching process I now effectively theoretically know how to speak with every animal!"" Marvin expositions.   ""Yes, that effectively covers what has just happened,"" said the Kookaburra, whose name was James. ""I now have to leave, so goodbye.""  As he flew off he cackled dramatically, as kookaburras are wont to do.   Time to put all this theoretical knowledge into practise, Marvin thought. Again, he was as alone as the day he was born. His first target was a spider. ""Hey there spider, you octo-freak"" Marvin said.  ""Fuck you,"" the spider replied. ""I don't have to put up with your shit, you're just a kid.""  Marvin ran as he knew the spider was fatally poisonous, like everything else in the outback. Perhaps a snake would be a better option. Luckily, one was just around the corner.  ""Grow some legs, faggot. Seriously, how do you even move? Are you powered by your own gayness?"" Marvin shouted.   ""Hey there buddy, that's incredibly homophobic. I honestly don't see how my sexual orientation could have any bearing on me having legs or not. Besides, you're crawling!"" the snake rebutted.   The horrible truth of Marvin's situation suddenly dawned upon him. He could understand and talk to animals, but only knows how to insult them. That damn conniving Kookaburra. He fled to a nearby cave, where he stayed for 40 years and 40 nights, hoping to live the rest of his life in isolation.   Fate would not let Marvin get off that easy. His cave soon became a film set for an upcoming film about a self-funded retiree who wants to find spiritual peace with the world. Rob Schnieder plays the lead role, in what he hoped would be a poignant return to form through serious indie drama.   While shooting a scene where Rob was trying to download some porn on his cell phone with limited reception, Marvin decided to see what all the ruckus was about.   ""Hey dude, this is my cave"" he said.   ""Oh, we're just in the middle of shooting a movie, we'll be out of here in a month or so"" the failed actor replied.   ""Nah man, this is my fortress of solitude. I need it because I can talk to animals, but only know how to insult them. It causes serious social problems.""  ""That sounds a little bit like my 2001 comedy film, *The Animal*. I played a character named Marvin Mange, who after receiving transplant organs from animals, gets way more than I bargained for.""  ""Marvin Mange, that's a cool name. As I don't have any real name (I was abandoned by my parents as a kid), I think I'll refer to myself as that from now on."" And so he did, and this also applies retrospectively.  ""Anyway man, have you considered just not talking to animals? It works for most people."" While a shitty actor, Rob Schnieder clearly had some hidden wisdom, like an encyclopaedia hidden within the world's largest turd.   ""Yeah that makes sense actually"" Marvin said.   And so, Marvin returned to human society, where he worked briefly as a telemarketer before finding a more permanent place as a notary for an insurance firm.   **THE END**",®

t5_2vper,joke-away,1366956354,"It's because you put five spaces in front of each paragraph as an indent, and in markdown that causes everything after it to be formatted as code- no automatic line breaks, and no other markdown. Here it is formatted a bit better:  &gt;In this evaluation paper I will evaluate myself and what I learned in this class as well as what I did in this class to further my knowledge. This class really challenged me. Throughout the semester I found myself searching for new ways to learn information and learning about topics in which I had never even heard of. It was refreshing for my mind and I enjoyed being in charge of my own assignments.  &gt;In the beginning of the semester I primarily focused on the readings and one big project that I did with 3 other members. For the project we worked on, we posted notes that we had made and used if we were actually presenting it to the class because I assumed we were making a video of the project being presented to the class. This didn’t end up being the case because we ran out of time so we just posted what we had which wasn’t bad but it wasn’t perfect either. The beginning readings definitely furthered my vocabulary I will admit to putting some of the words I read into dictionary.com. Though it was a bit difficult for me it was very beneficial to have to challenge myself. The topics were interesting and kept my attention.   &gt;That was the beginning of the semester though and I’m supposed to reflect on the second half of the semester so here we go. I definitely think that the second half of the semester was better than the first half at least for me. There was a little bit more structure that wasn’t overbearing but kept us on course. I liked the activities that we did in class as well as updates we had to give you about projects.   &gt;One day in particular that I really liked is when we did the anonymity debate. Although I didn’t go up and speak I gave many points and ideas to my team members and made our arguments stronger. It was great to be debating over anonymity because it was a topic that none of us had ever debated before. My group I believe did win the debate. ☺   &gt;Another day that I really liked this semester was when we got into in class groups to think of a new project. My group came up with the Givmo bags. Emily Lopez actually thought of the idea and is still working on the project. After we had thought of our idea on the first day our goal for the next class period was to gather supplies and Givmo. So we went around campus on that next day and gave out Givmo bags and explained to people what Givmo was. I would say the project was very successful.   &gt;Another area where I learned a lot was in badges. I had no idea what badges were or how to earn them. But now sometimes I earn them just for fun. It makes me feel important. Badges are a great way actually to learn and gain credibility on the Internet.   &gt;There was another day in class where we had to get into groups and create our own app. My group came up with two ideas one better than the other. Our app was a destination app. Basically you get points for making it to places on the fastest route. The idea that I came up with for an app was called Captain Extrovert. In that app you have to go on adventures. You have to check at the most adventure destinations to become Captain Extrovert.   &gt;I loved seeing all the videos of the new robots that people have made. We spent a day looking at those and discussing what they do. In my opinion robots are scary and could definitely take over the world if they become too prominent but it’s interesting to learn about them nonetheless. It is amazing how much they can do now and how human some of them look.   &gt;Another cool day was when we learned all about gaming and how everything pretty much is a game. Some of the readings and videos that we had for class were crazy! There are so many games out there. Prime example would be Darfur is Dying. This game would be pretty offensive to some people but it is an actual game and there thousands just like it on the web. New ones being created everyday.   &gt;For the second half of the semester I did some research on cameras being all around us. I was reading some of what popped up on my yahoo news feed and that topic came up I was instantly interested. It didn’t get much feedback on Reddit from my classmates. I think that the topic is so true and happens today in all of our lives. I think that we even had a class where we watch a video on someone ordering a pizza and that person on the other end of the phone knew everything about him. Anyways not to babble on about it but it is just so crazy how much people really know about us.   &gt;I think that this class has definitely expanded my horizons. I have a more open view of how the learn now. I also learned so many new things about technology that I could never have learned on my own. This was a new perspective to learn from as well. Most of my classes are filled with communication major who have been taught to think a certain way. It was cool to get out there and learn from the other minds we have in the class. The format of things was also very new for me. It was challenging to get used to but in the end I think it was good for me to be responsible for my own work. I think that all in all this class was a success in furthering my knowledge. That is what school is for so hey win win. ",☺

Personally speaking, I want the liquidpedia page (and its approach to presentation) to be the one stop shop for builds. However, the information there is quite outdated and there isn't a way to emphasize which builds are currently more prevalent with trending play style / meta.  Even better, a community owned Yabot map where said builds can be executed (at least enough so that you can do them ingame against a real opponent).  Video content is nice, but I think the writing comes first.  I definitely think that if the liqudpedia was improved, it could be presented as THE RESOURCE for builds, severely limiting the number of questions.  I would update the wiki myself but I have (much to my own detriment aND performance) not found builds to use. Just general guidelines (1 gateway expand, pressure with units; 1 gate, 1 tech, another gate, push; assortment of zealots, archon, and storm; stalker, colossus, storm; mass carrier 😉).",😉

A lot of us got our voice back when she came to land to try and sabotage us, we stole her necklace where she stashed our voices.

t5_2qh2p,watchmanforchrist,1366991473,"JAN 14, 2013 PROPHETIC REVELATION OF GOD: AGAIN THE MESSENGER ANGEL OF GOD PASSES ON REVELATIONS ABOUT FALLEN ANGELS TO PROPHET BENJAMIN COUSIJNSEN, IN THE NAME OF THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On January 14th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, I am Arodai, the messenger angel of God. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Benjamin, the fallen angels are superior extraterrestrial higher developed devilish technological angels. Their appearance is as an observable beautiful angel of light. These false angels master the linguistics, and are highly gifted in flawless English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese and many other languages. They have remarkable UFOs transport equipment. Also, they try to stand close to the Almighty with their knowledge.     Also, there have been taken place many today's encounters with the antichrist Obama. The involvement with Earth is enormously! Obama is also telepathically connected with these fallen angels of satan.  Benjamin, between Mars and Jupiter is one planet, where many fallen angels are. And also in Mexico, in the sea, a transport base for UFOs is located. The government remains as quiet as the grave about the fallen angels! The antichrist and the pope and the Muslim Brotherhood have already been in touch and made plans and signed them. They want the fallen angels to reveal and show themselves! This is done already.  Ephesians 6, verse 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.  Many Christians often forget to ask for protection. Read these scriptures aloud: Romans 13, verse 12 The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.  Isaiah 54, verse 17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says the LORD.  Ephesians 6, verse 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, verily,  2 Samuel 22, verse 31 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.  Benjamin, some Christians want God to do everything for them, without doing anything themselves. They are still just babies, who have it all their own way. Wake up there! God is very holy! God just wants you to fight against it. Use God's armor, cover yourself, Christian warriors, under the Blood of Jesus Christ, and defeat this chameleon. Come, stand on it, crush its head in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Thus there are many, who put aside the Holy Spirit, and just keep complaining, why God did not help them!  Job 5, verse 8 and 9 But as for me, I would seek God, To God would I commit my cause; Who does great things that can't be fathomed, Marvelous things without number.  The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, stand in His strength, and thank Him, who belongs all honor and worship! Amen.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! said the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM! God bless you",©
t5_2qh2p,watchmanforchrist,1366991572," PROPHECY 2013 - REVELATION OF GOD: VERILY, 2013: THEY WILL REMEMBER THEMSELVES WELL! YOU THERE, GRAB YOUR BIBLE AND HEAR AND READ! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On January 3rd, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen, who always writes down everything, word for word, accompanied by the messenger angel of God, the angel of the Lord himself.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Arodai. Verily, verily, I tell you,  The fallen angels have already mingled themselves among the unbelievers and believers! The government will not be able anymore, to keep secret about the contact with the aliens, because the world will be introduced to the 'visitors from space'. They will reveal and show themselves. They will soon land at Jerusalem and on Mount Zion! Also, these highly advanced extraterrestrial fallen angels will appear on the scene soon, and they will take over the power of Rome, and they will be part of humanity. Therefore, the new pope will do wonders and miracles, and present himself. These fallen angels are connected and cooperate with the antichrist Obama and the pope; this is their plan.  Isaiah 13, verse 6 to 9 Wail; for the day of the LORD is at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt. They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame. Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it.  Many extraterrestrial fallen angels have already taken over many people, and especially taken over their minds!  2 Samuel 22, verse 14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. Verily, fear not!  2 Samuel 22, verse 31 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all those ""in Christ,"" added the messenger angel of God, who take refuge in him.  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  2 Thessalonians 3, verse 2 to 3 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for not all have faith. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one.  Read this for yourself: Luke 11, verse 21 to 23, and Ephesians 6, verse 10 to 19.  Verily, 2013 they will remember themselves well! There is only one Way out: Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  2 Peter 3, verse 17 and 18 Read this also for yourself.  You there, listen!  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Benjamin, I'm going again, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!",©

It seems everyone in there is happy. Kids and adults, everyone was smiling an happy, little kids would run around shoutin "" I can see goofy over there"" followed bz  little girls in cute princess outfits. The coasters and stuff was ok,but not the best I've had.

We can assume that's it's about patch time based on their usual schedule, but ""Within the next week or two."" is probably the best answer we can give (Other than Soon™).

t5_2qnan,BadSchpeller,1367001674,"An update on this since I've worked with it the past few days:  My current configuration is:  Cluster 1, Qty 3 x R710s with X5670 procs. Has EVC mode for Intel ""Westmere"" Generation applied.  Cluster 2, Qty 4 x R620s with E5-2667 procs. Has EVC mode for Intel ""Sandy Bridge"" Generation applied.  I vMotioned all systems out of Cluster 1 into Cluster 2. Cluster 2 is running an EVC mode that is newer with backward-compatible feature set. Within the EVC description for cluster 2 it states:  *Compared to the Intel® ""Westmere"" Generation EVC mode, this EVC mode exposes additional CPU features including AVX, XSAVE, and ULE.*  Attempts to vMotion some systems (2008R2, 2012) back into Cluster 1 from cluster 2 fails at the validation step due to the VM running EVC features that cluster 1 can't support. Attempts to vMotion 2008, 2003, Linux and Netware systems from cluster 2 back to cluster 1 ARE successful. Once the VM is vMotioned to a cluster with additional features the guest OS can utilize(2k8r2+), it appears to start utilizing them.  You can set an older EVC feature set on a cluster (as long as no VMs are running on an already set, newer EVC mode at the time as they could be utilizing those features already). So if I had started this whole thing with running both clusters (or a single cluster) at Westmere EVC mode, I could shift them back. If I'd want to change the EVC mode for cluster 2 back to Westmere at this point, I'd have to shut down all VMs in the cluster.  I'll most likely shut down a few and move them back to cluster 1 and power on.",®

t5_2qh2p,watchmanofchrist,1367007054,"APR 24, 2013  HAPPINESS IS A PROCESS, BUT IS OFFERING NO GUARANTEES! HE, ON THE OPPOSITE, GIVES YOU 100% THE GUARANTEE OF ETERNAL LIFE, AND THIS IS FOR SURE HIS PURPOSE AND PROCESS! HEAR, HE CALLS YOU BY NAME! Please share and do not change © BC                             Full view:  Hello, welcome! On April 24th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.   Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Maroeij. I tell you, Fear not, if I, the messenger angel of God, tell you that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, loves you.  Verily, take a good look at the things, and all the beauty that has not been made by man. Look at the shape of a mountain and the flow of a river. And what about the infinity of the sky and the beautiful nature? Is God not great and wonderful?  Now Take a look at yourself; God made you too! Maybe you’ll finally realize it once now, that you are truly not alone on the world. Verily, regardless of your age or your social position, IQ, your health condition or whatever! Verily, make use of the narrow right road. Do you know what you need? That is forgiveness for your sins.  Mark 7, verse 20 to 23   He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”  Listen, verily!  John 8, verse 12  Again, therefore, ""Yeshua HaMashiach"", Jesus Christ, spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.” ""Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is mentioned with this!""    Most people see happiness as a goal in itself in their lives. Happiness is not a goal, but is a process, but is offering no guarantees. Verily, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, on the opposite, is offering you guarantees and eternal life! And this is His purpose and process for sure. He’s giving you 100% the guarantee of eternal life, and moreover, this is premium and tax free, for free!  Read aloud: John 3, verse 16 to 20  Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  You there, verily, choose this day whom you want to serve now!  Read aloud: Revelation 20, verse 15  Here it is written: If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,     He who turns a deaf ear to wisdom, is stupid. You can be saved today! Repent! Be there in God's Kingdom, and be written down in the Book of Life. Go through the gate of heaven, go now towards Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and receive eternal life! This is the true happiness and God's purpose: to save humanity from hell! God is love, true love. He calls you by name!  Read aloud: John 6, verse 33 and 34  Here it is written: For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.  They said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”   The messenger angel of God spoke further, I’m going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM! God bless you  ",©
t5_2qnp7,munky9001,1367007054,"lol I was on a phone call with a symantec guy and I just copied and pasted sysinternals into the rdp session and he had webex to the rdp session only. So he kinda got surprised as he'd said, 'Are you familiar with process explorer' and I just immediately copied and pasted sysinternals onto the desktop. He was surprised to say the least.  On a side note. The SMB partner tech support guys at symantec are absolutely amazing and he got a resolution for me because Backup Exec 2012 isnt compatible with Exchange 2013. So it just instantly crashes the remote agent. So I got a fix for that. Though I cant actually backup Exchange sadly. There's a new SP in beta testing right now to test that out and get me support. SOON™ no doubt.  PS. Fuck you exchange team. You are the absolute worst.",™

t5_2qh2p,watchmanofchrist,1367018837,"Published on Apr 8, 2013 by pengharapan05  APR 8, 2013 PROPHETIC MESSAGE OF GOD ABOUT THE RAPTURE, ALSO CALLED THE GATHERING OR SNATCHING AWAY: IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE! MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE VERY SOON RAPTURE NOW! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On April 8th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, the Son of the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. My name is Rafaël.  When you are being taken away by God's enormous power, you are clothed in shiny linen. It feels more comfortable than a spacesuit. When you are being pulled through the air, up through the air, God will show you yet once, how beautiful and large the Earth was. It goes very fast! That great power snatches you so away, up! It's the most beautiful moment of your life.  You'll see all those beautiful colors and all those people, verily, even animals! Those are not dressed in bright linen, but God will bring them home safely. You will be amazed about what you'll see around you! Even babies and people with disabilities will go to Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  The beauty of the Earth will change immediately after the snatching away. Smoke and fire will be seen, after you are seeing yet just briefly your beautiful Earth at a distance. On the Earth there will be a worldwide earthquake, and the trumpets will be heard by many. Even the deaf will hear it, who are connected in Yeshua HaMashiach. The trumpet of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, will cause by the sound, the vibration on Earth. Then there will be chaos.     Of alien planets has already been revealed to you, Benjamin Cousijnsen, that the Earth was not the only planet with life.  On arrival, it will be very moving! The blind can see, the lame can walk, and the deaf can hear. Even all the pains and diseases are no more, and even arms and legs have grown back!  Read aloud: Jeremiah 32, verse 27, and Revelation 11, verse 12, 1 John 2, verse 15 to 16, and 1 John 4, verse 7 to 12 Jeremiah 32, verse 27 Here it is written: Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too wonderful for me?  Revelation 11, verse 12 Here it is written: I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, ""Come up here!"" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.  1 John 2, verse 15 to 16 Here it is written: Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.  1 John 4, verse 7 to 12 Here it is written: Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God. He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love. By this was God's love revealed in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.  Verily, Benjamin saw many images... Benjamin saw many crying of joy when they arrived there, with Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Doors opened; there was a hall, where many angels of God were among the guests.  Verily, get yourself ready for the strong, powerful snatching away! Be pure in heart, soul and body, and choose Him now today, and bring your sins to Him. He has called you today, and he who does not want to hear, will perish. Do not stay behind!  Behold, I come very soon! Thus speaks the Lord. Ruacha, Jeshu, Emanuel, Maranatha, Shalom!  SHALOM!

Example: I'm trying to replace my compressor belt. A normal car would have a tensioner and the job would be done in a few minutes. My car utilizes a stretch belt that requires purchasing a $100 tool (read: small piece of BMW™ metal) to get the belt on while turning the engine over by hand.

FURTHER: GOD'S WORDS GO IN FULFILLMENT!  Please share, do not change © BCousijnsen    Full view:   Hello! In the afternoon of August 21ST 2012 the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.   Shalom, Benjamin Cousijnsen! My name is Elasa. I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, the King of kings.   You there, I speak, and the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham speaks through me by the scriptures to you, if you are listening.   Ezekiel 7, verse 2 and 3 You, son of man, thus says the Lord to the land of Israel, An end: the end is come on the four corners of the land. Now is the end on you.   Ezekiel 12, verse 26 to 28 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off. Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says the Lord.   1 Peter 5, verse 8 and 9 Be sober and Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.   2 Peter 1, verse 21 For no prophetic message ever came just from the human will, but people were under the control of the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God.   You there, I hear you say, ""Why does God speak to me through the scriptures? I know about all this, I know God's Words. Is this now a prophet?""   Everything goes through your thoughts, and you gossip about this prophet of God...  and you pass it on. Because you know it all better.   One thing you don't know! You try to fight against the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham.  God will never let a slanderer, a gossiper, admit into His Kingdom.   Benjamin has been appointed by God Himself!  God will never be able to bless you, because you're jealous and cannot stand it all. Why him, and not me!? The reason also is, because you are not chosen. Such a prophet God really does not want! I am a messenger angel of God, Elasa, and I can know it! If you really know it all from the scriptures, as Satan also knows the scriptures, why don't you listen to God's commandments? Are these your fruits? I tell you, in Jesus Christ's Name, don't call yourself a christian! Repent, before it is too late.   Matthew 10, verse 38 He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.   Prophet of God, Benjamin Cousijnsen, who doesn't want to hear, will be lost.  If you say, 'punish', so it shall be, in the name of Jesus Christ, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham.  Benjamin, you are His prophet, whom he loves, and has appointed.

t5_2qh2p,watchmanofchrist,1367019845,"Published on Nov 25, 2012 by Jason Cox   AUG 21, 2012 THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB FOCUSES ON THE GOSSIPER AND EVIL SPEAKER; THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED IN GOD'S KINGDOM! FURTHER: GOD'S WORDS GO IN FULFILLMENT!  Please share, do not change © BCousijnsen    Full view:   Hello! In the afternoon of August 21ST 2012 the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.   Shalom, Benjamin Cousijnsen! My name is Elasa. I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, the King of kings.   You there, I speak, and the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham speaks through me by the scriptures to you, if you are listening.   Ezekiel 7, verse 2 and 3 You, son of man, thus says the Lord to the land of Israel, An end: the end is come on the four corners of the land. Now is the end on you.   Ezekiel 12, verse 26 to 28 Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off. Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says the Lord.   1 Peter 5, verse 8 and 9 Be sober and Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.   2 Peter 1, verse 21 For no prophetic message ever came just from the human will, but people were under the control of the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God.   You there, I hear you say, ""Why does God speak to me through the scriptures? I know about all this, I know God's Words. Is this now a prophet?""   Everything goes through your thoughts, and you gossip about this prophet of God...  and you pass it on. Because you know it all better.   One thing you don't know! You try to fight against the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham.  God will never let a slanderer, a gossiper, admit into His Kingdom.   Benjamin has been appointed by God Himself!  God will never be able to bless you, because you're jealous and cannot stand it all. Why him, and not me!? The reason also is, because you are not chosen. Such a prophet God really does not want! I am a messenger angel of God, Elasa, and I can know it! If you really know it all from the scriptures, as Satan also knows the scriptures, why don't you listen to God's commandments? Are these your fruits? I tell you, in Jesus Christ's Name, don't call yourself a christian! Repent, before it is too late.   Matthew 10, verse 38 He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.   Prophet of God, Benjamin Cousijnsen, who doesn't want to hear, will be lost.  If you say, 'punish', so it shall be, in the name of Jesus Christ, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham.  Benjamin, you are His prophet, whom he loves, and has appointed.   Psalm 51, verse 13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners shall be converted to you.   Proverbs 6, verse 12 to 15 A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words; Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers; His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts. For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him.   Whoever utters lies, shall perish.  I'm going now...

Please share and do not change © BC                          Full view:  Hello! On December 21st, 2012, the messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.    Shalom! I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am a messenger angel of God, who passes on every word, that the Almighty speaks through me.  My child, listen once very well! Grieve not, I have seen your tears. Blessed are those who mourn, for My sake. You shall be comforted by Me. I have seen your pain. I called you by name, but you did not hear Me. Blessed are you when they beat you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely. Verily, therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known. He who endures to the end, he will be saved.  You have an inner wound deeply buried, about which you’ve never talked. Come to Me! I will give you rest. I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest unto your souls. I saw, My child, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes. Fear not, what I tell you in the full truth... You have been forced to intercourse, time after time. Verily, verily, I tell you, Fear Me not! I shall allow/let the sun of righteousness arise, and I will bring healing to you.  Which wound have you tucked away? Verily, expose it! He who believes in Me and accepts Me, is not condemned. My dear child, you are not bad, but satan is!  1 Corinthians 3, verse 16 and 17  Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?  If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are, ""and not filthy""!  My child, listen once... Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even your Passover has been sacrificed, I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I was also beaten and slain. Give Me your wound from your innermost!  John 3, verse 18 and 19  He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. John 3, verse 20 and 21  For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.  My name is Racha and I brought you this message, and tell you, The Lord speaks through the Bible to many hearts! He helps you and strengthens you! ",©

IN THIS TIME THE LORD REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE CHAMELEONS, THAT ARE INTENDING THE DESTRUCTION OF MAN! Please share and do not change © BC     Full view:  Welcome! On March 19th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Barinco, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. Verily, listen attentively!  The fallen angels belong to satan, and masquerade as angels of light, just like satan. Through their spaceships one uses a virtual image projection mover, that allows them to be able to move themselves.  The following are characteristics of fallen angels...  They have a piercing look, an inner eye, as it were, of satan himself. They have a higher consciousness than man, and a higher technological knowledge. They express kindness, understanding and experience like angels, and they communicate among themselves by telepathic means.  Their goal is the total takeover of man. They feel strongly connected to the earth, and are relatives of Lucifer. Their length is 7 feet 10 inches. They want to influence human, because they hate the creation of God.  Genesis 1, verse 27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.  From the beginning satan was against it, that the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham made man in His image! For this reason they still resist, by influencing man among others, by conveying thoughts that go in against God.  Colossians 2, verse 15, and Luke 1, verse 70 and 71, and Ephesians 6, verse 13 Read this aloud. Colossians 2, verse 15 Here it is written: And having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Luke 1, verse 70 and 71 Here it is written: As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old, Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us. Ephesians 6, verse 13 Here it is written: Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.  Verily, also many souls who have rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, will burn in hell, but Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, just wants to save man only! The fallen angels, on the opposite, will first go destroy everything, what God brought together. Only by surrendering yourself and repenting of your worldly walk, with remorse, you can be saved. He can save you today, if you have not yet made a choice. Even though you are also a Christian in the great tribulation, even then only the strongest ones will conquer!  Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20, and John 3, verse 16 Read this aloud. Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20 Here it is written: Above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints: on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  Verily, it is up to you what you'll do with this message. Not to choose for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, means to perish! He who does not want to hear, will go lost.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  I would also advise you to download and copy the messages with this topic, and to keep it as information. Perhaps you are a Christian and you trust on the Rapture, but think also of the people, that you care a lot about, and who does not want to know anything of it. It will be a good source of information!  They can still always become a Christian after the Rapture.

Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Barinco, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. Verily, listen attentively!  The fallen angels belong to satan, and masquerade as angels of light, just like satan. Through their spaceships one uses a virtual image projection mover, that allows them to be able to move themselves.  The following are characteristics of fallen angels...  They have a piercing look, an inner eye, as it were, of satan himself. They have a higher consciousness than man, and a higher technological knowledge. They express kindness, understanding and experience like angels, and they communicate among themselves by telepathic means.  Their goal is the total takeover of man. They feel strongly connected to the earth, and are relatives of Lucifer. Their length is 7 feet 10 inches. They want to influence human, because they hate the creation of God.  Genesis 1, verse 27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.  From the beginning satan was against it, that the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham made man in His image! For this reason they still resist, by influencing man among others, by conveying thoughts that go in against God.  Colossians 2, verse 15, and Luke 1, verse 70 and 71, and Ephesians 6, verse 13 Read this aloud. Colossians 2, verse 15 Here it is written: And having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Luke 1, verse 70 and 71 Here it is written: As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old, Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us. Ephesians 6, verse 13 Here it is written: Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.  Verily, also many souls who have rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, will burn in hell, but Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, just wants to save man only! The fallen angels, on the opposite, will first go destroy everything, what God brought together. Only by surrendering yourself and repenting of your worldly walk, with remorse, you can be saved. He can save you today, if you have not yet made a choice. Even though you are also a Christian in the great tribulation, even then only the strongest ones will conquer!  Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20, and John 3, verse 16 Read this aloud. Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20 Here it is written: Above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints: on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  Verily, it is up to you what you'll do with this message. Not to choose for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, means to perish! He who does not want to hear, will go lost.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  I would also advise you to download and copy the messages with this topic, and to keep it as information. Perhaps you are a Christian and you trust on the Rapture, but think also of the people, that you care a lot about, and who does not want to know anything of it. It will be a good source of information!  They can still always become a Christian after the Rapture. Only then it will be very difficult - like this message says - to be strong and maintain, in..............   PLEASE, SEND ME A MESSAGE FOR THE COMPLETE TEXT.",©

The Zen in in the monk class is from its unknowns and balanced playstyle. From what I've played, sometimes I have to stand my ground and fight (while under serenity) while other times I have to run away for a while waiting for breathe of life or flash. I need to manage my spirit in battle to make sure I am being effective and spending it, but have to be careful to retain enough spirit to engage the next set of mobs effectively. Lastly, the monk is plain fun and isnt't broken 😃  Right now I've only used gear that I've found while farming on my wizard. The result is I have high dex and damage but 0 survivability. At this point I think it requires a complete re gear to something more sustainable (and can handle mp2+).  I also want to learn how to use combination strike with three spirit generators (or at least understand the efficiency of it).  My perfect farming run would start in Festering woods, where the dregs of the nephalem betrayers and legacy remain. They must be purified. From there, I head over to Leoric's manor. A great many people suffered due to the actions taken here, and while the good King was not in his right mind, some degree of blame lies with him. This house must be cleansed of the cultists that take residence. Examples must be made, the balance must be maintained. With the bulk of the cultists removed we move onto the purge of the halls of agony. Many people have suffered here for years in this damnable place and there is no need for this suffering to continue. From the undead warden straight to the hellish butcher, all is cleaned. From there, we must attend to matters less dire but nonetheless important: restoring balance to the fields of misery by removing the disruptive influence of an elusive Khazra brute (which hopefully also serves to quiet the local flora). After spending so much time wallowing through the filth and sins, the last task is one of absolution within the furtive lands filled with rainbows and unicorns.",😃

t5_2qmeb,Tsukimizu,1367074424,"You're welcome! Here's a bit more information on Shadowless cards (The thing I should have linked the last time)  &gt;Base Set is also unique in that Wizards were still experimenting with the layout and aesthetics of the cards after the 1st Edition run, which becomes apparent when cards from both 1st Edition and Unlimited are compared. The most obvious change is the weighting of text for HP values and attacks; they are much bolder in Unlimited. Another was the inclusion of a drop shadow under the character illustration window, supposedly added to give the card more depth. This later inclusion led to the naming of a transitional run, often called Shadowless, in which a small print run of Base Set was produced without the 1st Edition symbol, as well as without the changes mentioned above that were added in the actual Unlimited run. The Shadowless cards are also highly sought after by collectors because of their rarity being close to that of the first edition.

t5_2tm1t,blueavenue_,1367079898,"Your post is insincere. You honestly expect me to think that you just 'found' an exploit in the server mods? You researched colo services purely out of the goodness of your heart, with no foul intentions at all?  That's funny, because yesterday on ButthurtCraft, you were spotted saying the following things;  http://imgur.com/0eKQXdX,zBxQUNJ  ""We've tried for 6 months to expose the crimes through other means"".  Give me a break dude  &gt;I decided to start using this information for good.  How many times have I heard this from criminals on the server? They always try and paint themselves as moral crusaders. I guess it's how they cope with being a gigantic cunt.  &gt;I didn't spend an awful lot of time, but I found much evidence of bias, a lot more than I can show here. The admins openly knew that many of the BHC-side of the war were hacking, duping, world-downloading and associating with banned players, yet did nothing to stop it, yet when it was our side, people were banned for much less.  Again, this is hilarious. You really think we're that dumb to believe this tripe, don't you? You guys have basically doxxed Erich, ruined the entire server, but you can't be forced to come forward with more evidence? Fucking lol. There is no other evidence, or if there is, it's just as menial as rearranging a few bedrock blocks.   Honestly hamster, I feel really really really sorry for you. It's clear you have some sort of emotional problem. From the multi-hour argument we had about your alts, and now this. It's clear you are an obessive kid who is a pathological liar. We all know you were Fluffy_Giraffe and Angel_Works, no one really cared that much. The entire time you vehemently denied them being you, despite the mountain of evidence against you. Now, you're trying to paint yourself as a martyr for the greater good™ by, once again, pretending that you're so much smarter and wittier than everyone else.  Seriously, fuck off. Like I said to Fluffy, I sincerely wish you luck in your life because there's clearly some void in your emotional intelligence that needs a lot of work to patch up. 16 year olds all do stupid things, I know I had more than my fair share of stupidity, but I never intentionally destroyed millions of hours of people's hard work and fun because I felt victimized by a handful of people. You're really that self-righteous that you actually believe this bullshit you're spewing? I'm not even going to give you the satisfaction of getting mad, all I can really say is to get help, and get it now. Therapy can do a lot of good for you if you let it. ",™

t5_2qh13,mkvgtired,1367085336,"Austerity is much different in the US, UK, Germany, etc. than in a place like Greece. Greece is the definition of a country that ran out of other peoples' money. In February of last year their short term borrowing [rate hit roughly 1200%](http://i.imgur.com/vYsm6UL.png) (© Bloomberg).   Talking about how austerity will hurt the economy is moot if its impossible to keep these employees on otherwise. The Greeks that are drawing swastikas on Merkel's face dont seem to realize without German money *many* more of them would be unemployed. Germany, the ECB, and the IMF were their last hope unless they wanted to default (which would also result in severe unemployment).  I think they should have defaulted, but it would have definitely put a lot of Europe in a worse position. Many prominent banks heavily invested in Greek government debt because of the higher yields and the assumption it was safe because the Eurozone members wouldnt let them default. So Greece and Europe would have been much worse off in the short term, but it would force European banks to start building up healthy assets.   I have to note, a Greek default could spread to other European nations because they would be forced to bail out their banks (one of the reasons for France's downgrade was exposure to this). So above I am talking about a *best* case scenario if Greece had a full default. Worst case it could plunge much of Europe into a recession or even a prolonged depression because of the domino effect it could have.   **TL;DR: We can debate austerity in countries that have the option to implement it or not. In Greece's case, its back was against the wall, it had only two options, both resulting in forced austerity.**",©

I know how to make this world into a paradise, my project (even [patent applied in 2004](http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2007055618), to guarantee that no maniac would attempt to abuse the road to the paradise), but the struggle and possible contradiction is, how do I know that this world is not just a prison, or ""the hell"", as the world is so weird and predictable. If I succeed everyone who wants can get ""eternal"" life, but... in case this world is fake, just a backdrop, a fake scenario, a game, then I would enable people to be preserved in hell.

I should add that I've got small hints from  ""assumingly a divine but anonymous God"" my whole life, This would indicate that I'm on the right track, but I do not trust anyone or anything.

t5_mouw,kerovon,1367118243,"Unfortunately, the 3 citations to Wakefield papers are used to directly used as evidence for the autism thing, with statements like  &gt;A strong link between autism and hepatic encephalitis has been identified [55],  &gt;Studies have convincingly shown an inflammatory mucosal immunopathology in children with regressive autism characterized by infiltration of intestinal epithelial lymphocytes [76].  &gt;parallel between autism and hepatic encephalitis has been made, emphasizing the role that ammonia plays as a toxin in the brain in both cases [219,220].  All citing Wakefield papers.  And statements like   &gt;studies involving life-long exposure in rodents have demonstrated liver and kidney dysfunction and a greatly increased risk of cancer, with shortened lifespan [9].  &gt;However, the fact that female rats are highly susceptible to mammary tumors following chronic exposure to glyphosate [9]  &gt;A long-term study conducted on rats showed remarkable pathologies that became apparent only after the three-month period that is usually allotted for toxicity trials. In this experiment, rats were monitored over their entire lifespan, while being fed either genetically modified (GM) or non-GM maize that had been optionally treated with Roundup® [9]. The rats that were chronically exposed to Roundup® developed several pathologies over the course of their lifespan, including large mammary tumors in the females and gastrointestinal, liver and kidney pathologies, especially in the males. The males developed both skin and liver carcinomas. Premature death in the treated male rats was mostly due to severe hepatorenal insufficiencies.  &gt;Another type of cancer that may be implicated with glyphosate exposure is breast cancer. The strongest evidence for such a link comes from the studies on rats exposed to glyphosate in their food supply throughout their lifespan, described previously, where some of the female rats succumbed to massive mammary tumors [9].  &gt;A study on three microorganisms commonly used as starters in dairy technologies demonstrated that Roundup®, but not glyphosate, inhibited microbial growth at lower concentrations than those recommended in agriculture [47]  &gt;In [109], as little as 10 ppm. of glyphosate disrupted aromatase activity in human liver HepG2 cells, a well-established cell line to study xenobiotic toxicity.  &gt;The lipophilic nature of these steroids allows them to diffuse across the lipid bilayers. CYP19A1 (aromatase), whose inhibition has been confirmed in association with glyphosate [109,110]  &gt;In a recent in vitro study of a mouse tumor Leydig cell line, Roundup was shown to disrupt StAR expression, thus interfering with testosterone synthesis [254].  All based off of Seralini papers.  I'm not familiar enough with the major names of toxicology/roundup studies to look through the other citations of major red flags, but if you use authors like Wakefield and Seralini that much, then you probably included other bad studies in your paper, which would make me doubt what you say.

t5_2qh2p,watchmanofchrist,1367120819,"REVELATIONS ABOUT THE FALLEN ANGELS BY THE ALMIGHTY GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB. IN THIS TIME THE LORD REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE CHAMELEONS, THAT ARE INTENDING THE DESTRUCTION OF MAN! Please share and do not change © BC     Full view:  Welcome! On March 19th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Barinco, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. Verily, listen attentively!  The fallen angels belong to satan, and masquerade as angels of light, just like satan. Through their spaceships one uses a virtual image projection mover, that allows them to be able to move themselves.  The following are characteristics of fallen angels...  They have a piercing look, an inner eye, as it were, of satan himself. They have a higher consciousness than man, and a higher technological knowledge. They express kindness, understanding and experience like angels, and they communicate among themselves by telepathic means.  Their goal is the total takeover of man. They feel strongly connected to the earth, and are relatives of Lucifer. Their length is 7 feet 10 inches. They want to influence human, because they hate the creation of God.  Genesis 1, verse 27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.  From the beginning satan was against it, that the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham made man in His image! For this reason they still resist, by influencing man among others, by conveying thoughts that go in against God.  Colossians 2, verse 15, and Luke 1, verse 70 and 71, and Ephesians 6, verse 13 Read this aloud. Colossians 2, verse 15 Here it is written: And having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Luke 1, verse 70 and 71 Here it is written: As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old, Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us. Ephesians 6, verse 13 Here it is written: Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.  Verily, also many souls who have rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, will burn in hell, but Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, just wants to save man only! The fallen angels, on the opposite, will first go destroy everything, what God brought together. Only by surrendering yourself and repenting of your worldly walk, with remorse, you can be saved. He can save you today, if you have not yet made a choice. Even though you are also a Christian in the great tribulation, even then only the strongest ones will conquer!  Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20, and John 3, verse 16 Read this aloud. Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20 Here it is written: Above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints: on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  Verily, it is up to you what you'll do with this message. Not to choose for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, means to perish! He who does not want to hear, will go lost.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  I would also advise you to download and copy the messages with this topic, and to keep it as information. Perhaps you are a Christian and you trust on the Rapture, but think also of the people, that you care a lot about, and who does not want to know anything of it. It will be a good source of information!  They can still always become a Christian after the Rapture. Only then it will be very difficult - like this message says - to be strong and maintain, in..............   PLEASE, SEND ME A MESSAGE FOR THE COMPLETE TEXT.",©

It's actually 16%.  Since the Wild Card (18 seasons -- no playoffs in 1994), 25 teams out of 30 have made it, out of only a possible 146 spots.  That's amazing playoff turnover.  The ones who haven't made it have been really badly run teams most of the time.  If you did the same analysis in the NBA, or NHL, and took away the 6-8 extra spots awarded every year, they would be a lot worse off than MLB in terms of percentage of teams that have missed the playoffs over the last 2 decades.  They reward mediocrity, far more than MLB does.  &gt;And you're still ignoring the effect ownership has on how management acts, on an organization as a whole and ultimately, on wins and losses.  No, I'm not, I'm saying that teams with shitty ownership and/or management are the ones that tend to do more poorly.  It doesn't matter what city they play in.  The from 1992-2010 the Mets in the biggest city in the Western world suffered under horribly incompetent front office ineptitude, and only made the playoffs 3 times.  The Cardinals in a tiny market won 2 world championships.  The Braves in a tiny market made the playoffs a zillion times.  The Rays are perennial playoff contenders and won an AL pennant in The Toughest Division In Baseball™, with an awful, archaic stadium in the middle of nowhere, no fan base and no one but octogenarians and transplanted Mets, Yankees and Red Sox fans going to games.  I could sit here and throw out counterexamples all day and all night, but the short version is, baseball is changing and growing all around you and only the small handful of teams who can't get their shit together, or have actively fraudulent ownership like the Marlins, are still crying about it.  So your argument is bogus.  &gt;The basis of your argument just doesn't make sense. For a team's long term success to boil down to only one variable, all other things would have to be equal. This clearly isn't, and never has been the case in baseball, and I'm to the point where I just don't get how you can't see that.  I didn't say it ""boils down to one variable"".  I said, teams that have good management *tend to* do better and teams that have worse management *tend to* do worse.  There are outliers: the Yankees have horrible inept management over the last 10 years or so, but they have spent enough to cover their mistakes.  But that's because they built a revenue stream by being a smartly run team prior to that, building a network, selling out their stadium and building their brand.  So they have the money to do this.  In the 80s, they were a bumbling PR joke, couldn't get anyone to go to games, and thus, didn't have a significant monetary advantage to compensate for doing stupid things.  So, they didn't make the playoffs every year.  You have emotional ties to a team that has been mired in incompetency for a long, long time and IMO you are invested in repeating memes that ""small market"" teams' fans and beat writers chant as a mantra.  It just isn't true.  Look around -- the Brewers, Reds, Rays, and other ""small market"" teams are retaining their players for huuuuuuuge contracts.  There are zillions of dollars flowing through MLB.  The smart teams know how to generate that revenue and the crappy ones sit on the sidelines crying about it.",™

Played this level the most out of any in the series.   Outskirts/Metropolis (Halo 2)  Ground assault, with limited resources and marines, including close- and far-quarters, Warthog/Scorpion combat, and the first ever, incredibly ballsy and badass, Scarab kill. Includes my favorite easter egg of the series: the Scarab Gun.   The Covenant (Halo 3)  Ground assault, and then vehicle assault, with both a Hornet and a Warthog. Fighting brutes in vehicles and on foot, interior and exterior, as well as flood later. Epic large-scale double Scarab fight. And finally teaming up with the flood to kill the bastard you've been trying to kill for nearly two whole games. Includes some of my favorite music of the series.   Kikowani Station (Halo 3: ODST)  Full team of ODST's, ground combat of all ranges as well as in-air combat, with lots of explosive targets. Culminates in the only confirmed non-Spartan Scarab takedown. Includes my favorite quote of the series:  ◾Dutch: ""Well, like the good book says, payback's a bitch.""   ◾Mickey: ""I don't think it actually says that, Dutch.""   ◾Dutch: ""I'm paraphrasin', ya heathen!""   Long Night of Solace (Halo: Reach)  Starting with Noble's final ground assault as a team, and then going into free-fighting space combat. Then dropping into close- and mid- range combat in low- and normal- gravity. Culminates in far and away my favorite cutscene of the series.   Not gonna stick one in for Halo 4 because somehow, I really hated it.",◾

Prayers before meetings, meetings in church basements watched over by the pastor or his deacons. The internet gives a true neutral meeting place.

t5_2qh13,SycoJack,1367160035,"Texas rises up, takes back the land given to the U.S. post Mexican-American war.  Texas with it's new lands and powerful army of crazy rednecks pushes back the Mexicans.  With Mexicans pushed back 50 miles south of the border, Texas sets sights on communist Canadian scum.  Epic war ensues between Texas and New Canadia.  Canada sends in it's fierce and mighty army of rabid moose to reinforce the New Canadians.  Texans take a beating from the rabid moose, but push on.  Texas launches counter attack with it's new species of diamondback rattle snakes that are far more aggressive than traditional diamondbacks. They strike first and rattle later.  Stalemate between the diamondback and moose army occurs.  Canada attempts to break the stalemate by sending in it's elite Eskimo special forces groups.  Texas counters with the power of the sun, melting the Eskimo igloos.  Texas reinforces it's snake battalions with genetically modified honey bees, designed to be damn near invincible, having cross bred with killer bees. The Monsanto Texas Bee™ is the largest, deadliest bee in the world.  Unfortunately it has a severe weakness to the cold. Canada uses snowball throwing toddlers to effectively dispatch the killer Texan bee nuisance.  Ultimately it boils down to a land war. Unfortunately for the Canadians, the Texans have the clear advantage here.  Canada ultimately loses the war and surrenders to Texas. Canada is forced to pay tribute to Texas in the form of maple syrup.  Texans rejoice, throw massive feasts every year involving major flavored flood in celebration of destroying the Canadian menace.  However as Texans grow fat on Canada's maple syrup, Canada secretly builds up an army to challenge Texas once again.  Will they win? Probably not, they're Canadians.",™

t5_2tduo,MsPrynne,1367162564,"I think part of the reason why this is tricky is that personally I have had every word that means ""fat"" or ""overweight"" applied to me as an insult, and I think a lot of other people share that experience. Because of this, my perception is that there seems to be a kind of unspoken understanding that there are literally no words that aren't painful to use for some people, and so as long as you don't use something completely egregious, it should be alright. Again, just my perception, some people may not agree.  Personally, I (and seemingly many others, especially SJ types) prefer the word ""fat."" For one thing, it's accurate, and I don't believe it should be an insulting word, so I don't see it as one (unless it's hurled at me in an obviously insulting manner). For two things, it's not a medical term. For three things, the euphemisms that people use to get around saying ""fat"" are frequently more irritating than the word itself. I remember reading an entire thing where the author referred to fat people as ""plus-sized."" Whaaaat. I'm not my clothes, fuck offff.  BUT, I can't just tell you to go around using the word ""fat"" in every discussion, because a lot of people understandably do not share my attitude towards it and have a very visceral reaction to hearing it applied to them, even in a good-faith discussion in the fempire.  Getting down to brass tacks:  **Words to avoid**:   * This is probably obvious, but I'll say it anyway, just to be comprehensive. If you could switch it into a reddit comment in place of one of those gross ""ham[large object]"" compound words that redditors are so fond of inventing without it altering the tone and intent of the comment, don't say it.  * If it sounds like something someone's grandmother would say at Thanksgiving dinner to the protagonist in a romantic comedy about how she needs to lose weight (chubby, plump, etc.) don't use it. * If it was invented by the clothing industry (plus-size, curvy, voluptuous, Real™), don't use it.  **Words that will probably not offend anyone in a good-faith discussion:**   * If you're using the word without applying it to a specific person (like, ""fat people have to deal with a lot of crap in modern society"" vs ""as a fat person, what do you think about the crap that fat people have to deal with in modern society?""), you can use fat.  * Overweight and obese, while not ideal terms, are some of the least crappy of the many crappy options available. * You can always go people first and say ""people of size."" Some people find that too stilted (I would never apply it to myself) but I don't think anyone will be offended.",™

t5_2qiye,dirtyPirate,1367163850,"you're missing one very important variable in your equation, your vessel's relation to shipping lanes.   For instance: I took a crossing from Andros Island Bahamas to Miami via the southern bank route, for 50 hours I was in 2 fathoms and never saw another boat. when I would sleep I just dropped the chute and used a headsail for self steering, I'd go below (in my jack line) and sleep,the longest I was down was 3 hours.    So if you're in shipping lanes, a radar detector will be great, a lookout would be nice but if your're single handing stay the fuck out of major shipping lanes.   &gt;Please tell me you don't ever ""go to sleep for as long as you wish"" when alone on a yacht and underway?  I could lie, but I wont, I sleep all the time when I'm off shore, I slept a full 8 hours hove to in the Gulf of Mexico, that's just as dangerous as sleeping underway, it doesn't matter what I hit, it's what hits me.   Edit: if you're interested a fellow redditor and sailor was singlehanding across the Pacific and getting exhausted from the lack of REM,he did the math and determined that if every single ship in the world was on the Pacific the odds of him hitting one was still extremely low.

t5_2tnz9,Talleyrayand,1367166316,"&gt; Now as of posting, nobody has suggested eugenics yet but to me it seems implicit in the original statement. It seems a very 'logical' step from ""I have no sympathy from those having kids if they can't afford them"" to ""therefore we should stop them doing this.""  Eugenics is _absolutely_ implied in that original statement.  Eugenic-minded Redditors are concerned about kids being ""poorly"" raised because they think the parents of these kids don't have the resources to ""properly"" raise children.  Ergo, if you can't do it right (as defined by le genius Redditors™), you shouldn't be able to do it at all.  The argument is implicitly about population _quality_, not quantity.

t5_2qh22,IssacandAsimov,1367182942,"(These are thoughts I’ve written previously on this film. They’ve been slightly modified to better fit this context, but my thoughts haven’t changed since the first time I watched this.)  Far be it from me to need to tell you the major theme of this work.  It's in the title of the film, it's characteristic of Shinkai and it's just plain painfully obvious that it's about distance. Physical distance, emotional distance, temporal distance, *distance*. It’s an honest approach. It’s rather well symbolically demonstrated by that scene right at the end where they seem to pass by at a railroad crossing. You know, how Tohno is sure if he looks back Akari will look back too, but by the time the train passes she’s gone. It’s basically the entire film summed up in one brief scene. (And of course, the second time around when he doesn’t look back.)  I’m no stranger to slow moving plots. I’m quite fond of Angel’s Egg, after all, and it doesn’t get much slower than that. 5cm is faster than that, but has a decidedly relaxed, languid pace. Part of the issue I take with Voices of a Distant Star is that it comes across as overwrought. 5cm is better in that regard, properly spacing out its human drama, but still gives a bit of an air of trying too hard to communicate its emotion so you feel like Shinkai is beating you over the head at points. This also doesn’t represent Shinkai challenging himself thematically at all. Sure, it’s a better done version of Voices of a Distant Star, but it’s heavily derivative of it. You know, Satoshi Kon hovered around similar themes in the works by him I’ve seen, but still managed to produce unique works around his hobby-horses. This is Shinkai saying “Hey, what I’ve done before? Let’s do almost exactly that, again,” which is lazy and uninspired. There’s a marked difference between also having your common themes, and only having your common theme.  Right, let’s move to a more positive note. The backgrounds and detail in this film are very impressive. I actually stopped in the middle of Cosmonaut to go back and marvel at a scene in a convenience store. It can be very technically competent at times, too. But what I’ve come to appreciate no more since Voices of a Distant Star is Shinkai’s style for humans (and considering how heavily involved he was in this film, you know he’s behind this matter too). You have a great looking film and then there’s just these kind of unappealing human designs that seem very out of place. It’s too bad.  I get the feeling that Shinkai choosing to embrace the narrative of moving on is going to perturb viewers who love Hollywood endings. You know, the sort who expect a shot at the end with the whole “speak now or forever hold your peace” bit where Tohno comes rushing in at the last second, stops the wedding, and Akari realizes she truly loves him and can’t marry this other guy. Sound like a familiar ending? That’s because it’s a happy one, and people like those. They’re hopeful, optimistic. They tell you “Everything turns out fine in the end! Just never give up!” They’re also childish, immature narratives. I applaud Shinkai’s choice not to give in and to stick to a more realistic, more mature narrative of distance and growing apart. Just because it seems like True Love™ doesn’t mean it’s fated to work out. Anyone who has lived life (which should be approximately 100% of us) knows that plenty of things just don’t work out, no matter how hard you believe in a just world. The Hollywood ending is escapist fantasy. Shinkai’s is colder, but substantially truer. Come to accept this, and you’ll appreciate the film a lot more.  I won’t call it a masterpiece like some have, because I honestly don’t feel that it is. It’s an interesting film that has its strengths and noticeable flaws. I haven’t seen Place Promised in our Early Days, but I’ve seen every other Makoto Shinkai work, and this is the strongest of them. Which doesn’t quite say that much, I guess, since I wasn’t all that enthused with his other works. Honestly, if you’re going to watch anything Shinkai, watch this one. I’m not in love with it, but it’s alright and worth a watch.  (Oh, and that music video at the end is pretty visually impressive, too.)",™

The castle was built in 1775 for Henry Disney Roebuck from designs by John Carter in the shape of the ""clubs"" symbol used in playing cards (♣). It has been suggested, originally in a magazine article in 1899, that he asked for the clubs design to represent an ace of clubs because he had obtained the money for the castle from gambling on a card game, but this is unlikely, as the porch which creates the ""stem"" of the symbol was added later.[1] It is more likely that the layout was taken from an article which had been published in Builder’s Magazine in 1774.",♣

t5_2ryr3,dfubgrtiuygbfb,1367188058,"Wow, have been following the SimCity Reddit for weeks but this post made me actually create an account.  Your numbers are so grossly underestimated, its unbelieveable.  EA stated a while ago that marketing usually outstrips developement by a longshot(at least for them).  Additionally, EA is the 2nd largest publisher in the world, with a gross revenue of something along 3-4 billions a year. Simcity was heavily marketed and was supposed to be one of their major releases this year (they said so at some investor conference/phone call). If you earn 4 billion a year, 30-40 million is peanuts(1%). A major release is considered 100s of millions of dollars (think CoD or BF3 style). While EA probably didnt think SimCity has the BF3 potential, they were at least calculating with a nice 8 digit profit!! everything else is again peanuts for a company of this size and does not warrant such a large scale advertisment front, so their expectations had to be in sales in the millions. And i bet money on it that they are actually scared shitless by their announced 1.3 million sales in the first few weeks. They were calculating WAY bigger. And they were calculating on lots and lots of DLCs and expansions ""The Sims"" Style raking in even more money.  As a comparison, in their last quarterly figures, EA stated that ""FIFA 13 digital net revenue topped $100 million""  Edit: According to the same report: The Simpsons™: Tapped Out generated over $23 million* in digital net revenue.

t5_2cneq,firemylasers,1367204598,"&gt;Really? What court has convicted Apple of poisoning and lying?  I was referring to the patent lawsuits for that quote, but you can take a look at Foxconn for your poisoning and lying evidence.  Admittedly, Apple is making an effort to improve their image, but the same can't really be said of Samsung (who was recently caught using child labor).  &gt;Also, really? ""Other guys do it too?"" That's a pathetic defence.  Name one thing Monsanto has done that is any worse than what the corporations I named have done. IBM assisted the Nazis with the holocaust. Siemens profited off of holocaust labor. Samsung uses child labor and has a creepy near-monopoly in some parts of the world. Apple (and a huge amount of other companies) use Foxconn, a company with big issues. Many other companies also manufactured Agent Orange. Sony lies about being hacked.  I'm not saying that what all these companies have done is *right*, but singling Monsanto out of the bunch makes no sense.  &gt;I am sure, and they haven't.   What has no influence on the (literally) hundreds of studies done in GMOs, all of which agree that all current commercial transgenic crops are safe.  &gt;http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/biopesticides/pips/starlink_corn.htm#allergenicity  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/business/study-raises-doubt-about-allergy-to-genetic-corn.html  &gt;In the test, the subject was given StarLink corn, other corn and a placebo on different days, without him or the doctors knowing which was which. There was no sign of an allergic reaction on any day.  http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/section-3/3-5-starlink/  &gt;1.  The Bt in Starlink corn has never been shown to be allergen and careful analysis of the Starlink event yields the conclusion that the Bt protein in Starlink, Cry9c, is mostly likely not an allergen. Contrary to Smith’s claims, most food-allergy experts believed that there was almost no chance that Starlink contained an allergen, while the EPA advisory panel apparently felt there was some very small but real chance it could become an allergen (CDC 2001, Lemaux 2008, Hefle and Taylor 2001). The problem observed with Cry9C is that it digests slowly in the simulated gastric fluid assay.  This doesn’t mean it is an allergen since indigestible proteins are not necessarily allergens.  At the time of the Starlink episode, known expert scientific opinion was backing away from an earlier proposition that protein indigestibility was an indicator of potential allergenicity.   More recently, some experts say that we should move away from the digestion assay completely because it is not predictive of allergenicity (Goodman and others 2008).  The EPA and EPA expert panels placed too much emphasis on the digestion assay.  They treated poor digestibility as an indicator of allergencity and did not sufficiently weight other data such as the fact that no Cry protein has ever caused human allergy or that the Bt protein in question, Cry9c, does not possess any structural resemblance to any known allergen.  It may be that EPA was too precautionary in their approach and sought 100 percent certainty that Cry9C was not an allergen.  &gt;3.  People were scared by the recall and many attributed their illnesses to Starlink. It is an unfortunate and well-documented fact that when scares like Starlink are announced and people then become ill, they will naturally attribute their illness to whatever is being recalled.  Think about it. If you ate a taco, became ill a couple of hours later, and then heard that taco shells were being recalled by the government, wouldn’t it enter your mind that maybe your illness was due to the taco you just ate?  Consumers can’t be criticized for thinking that if something is being recalled it must be dangerous.  In fact, dozens of claimed Starlink-related illnesses were carefully investigated and not a single subject had an IgE antibody that reacted with Cry9C—the Gold Standard test required to show allergenicity (Hefle and Taylor 2001).  There is no evidence that a single consumer was actually hurt by Starlink.  http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/summary.htm  &gt;On October 25, 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in investigating adverse event reports (AERs) of human illnesses that were potentially associated with consumption of genetically modified corn products. Prior to these reports, a protein named Cry9c had been inserted into genetically modified StarLink™ corn; it subsequently and inadvertently was introduced into the human food supply. CDC conducted an epidemiological investigation that included (1) reviewing the AERs, (2) administering questionnaires to all people who experienced adverse health effects and manifested signs and symptoms consistent with allergic reaction, (3) obtaining relevant medical records, and (4) collecting serum samples for temporary banking. The investigation concluded that 28 people had experienced apparent allergic reactions. These people had also reported eating corn products that may have contained Cry9c protein. With the endorsement of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Scientific Advisory Panel which convened on November 28, 2000, CDC recommended that the banked serum samples be evaluated to see if they contained evidence of an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;An FDA laboratory developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect antibodies to the Cry9c protein. CDC sent coded serum samples to FDA for analysis, including serum samples from the affected people and historically banked serum samples collected before Cry9c entered the food supply. CDC also sent serum samples from people identified as being highly sensitive to a variety of allergens. The ELISA method found that none of the CDC-submitted samples reacted in a manner consistent with an allergic response to the Cry9c protein.  &gt;These findings do not provide any evidence that the reactions that the affected people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Cry9c protein. The difficulties of this investigation highlight the importance of evaluating the allergic potential of genetically modified foods before they become available for human consumption.  Moving on...  &gt;Wow, six whole companies? That's.... fucking terrible! ""More than 80% of US corn and more than 90% of soybeans planted each year are attributable to Monsanto.""  Oh no, six companies produce the majority of transgenic seeds! It's a monopoly....oh wait, it's not a monopoly, and I'd like to see global statistics on market share, not just US ones (also, do you have a reputable source for that information?).  &gt;I try to. Unfortunately with your ""six companies"" it's impossible to know what manufactured products include frankenfoods.  If it says USDA-certified Organic, it has no or almost no transgenic food in it.  And frankenfoods? Seriously? Take your fearmongering and scare tactics somewhere else.",™

t5_2cneq,firemylasers,1367209810,"Your text came from that source, which used the discredited study. The CDC's report takes a much more reasonable stance, concluding that ""The test, as conducted, is limited by the use of E. coli -generated Cry9C, which may not possess the same epitopes as the Cry9C protein expressed in StarLink™ corn."".  They also conclude that ""The test, as conducted, does not eliminate StarLink™ Cry9C protein as a potential cause of allergic symptoms. The negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined."" and that:  &gt;Some of the individuals who claimed to have experienced an allergic reaction to the Cry9C protein following the ingestion of corn-based products kept samples of (or could identify) the products they ingested. FDA tested these foods for the presence of StarLink TM corn. StarLink TM corn DNA has not been detected in 10 of 11 food samples analyzed using the PCR method. The other sample of food, which tested positive using the PCR method, was not from the consumer’s actual product, but from a different lot of the same product collected by FDA from a grocery store. In addition, the Cry9C protein was not detected is 9 (including the food sample that tested positive using the PCR method) of the 10 samples tested with the EnvioLogix ELISA method. One of the 10 samples tested using the EnviroLogix method was inconclusive. There was no testing of one food sample using the EnviroLogix method because there was not enough of the remaining sample to conduct the test.  You claim that they said it's useless. The actual source merely says that it is not an absolute conclusion, and, crucially, that there is no demonstrated link between StarLink and allergenic potential.  So at best you have a ""medium possibility of a link"", plus evidence pointing towards no link.  That's a hell of a lot different from ""it's proven to be an allergen"".  &gt;Unfortunately not only cant you not read (unsurpring, really) , but ""academics review"" is a lobbyist blog written by a GMO shill.  You guys are so cute. So you're accusing the scientists behind the blog of being shills? Where's your evidence? Also, even if this was true, how would it even invalidate their review, which is based on peer-reviewed science, not personal opinion?  &gt;And I'm not jarjizzles. Whoopsy.  Yeah right.

Halliburton and KBR received BILLIONS in no-bid contracts for sub-standard work which actually caused the death of military personnel.  [Here is an article.](http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110406/NEWS/104060309/KBR-wants-Iraqi-law-used-in-electrocution-case)  The Patriot Act, among other things, allowed for warrantless wiretapping on US citizens.  Many people find this a more profound impact on our civil rights than the need for background checks at gun shows.  The list continues, up to and including a suspension o civil rights if you live within 100 miles of a border, and, as witnessed in Boston a few weeks ago, the militarization of the police.  Here are some other rights taken away by the Patriot Act:  Some of the fundamental changes to Americans' legal rights by the Bush administration and the USA Patriot Act following the terror attacks:   * FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION: Government may monitor religious and political institutions without suspecting criminal activity to assist terror investigation.   * FREEDOM OF INFORMATION: Government has closed once-public immigration hearings, has secretly detained hundreds of people without charges, and has encouraged bureaucrats to resist public records requests.   * FREEDOM OF SPEECH: Government may prosecute librarians or keepers of any other records if they tell anyone that the government subpoenaed information related to a terror investigation.   * RIGHT TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION: Government may monitor federal prison jailhouse conversations between attorneys and clients, and deny lawyers to Americans accused of crimes.   * FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES: Government may search and seize Americans' papers and effects without probable cause to assist terror investigation.   * RIGHT TO A SPEEDY AND PUBLIC TRIAL: Government may jail Americans indefinitely without a trial.   * RIGHT TO LIBERTY: Americans may be jailed without being charged or being able to confront witnesses against them.  Copyright © 2002, The Associated Press   If dying diplomats are so important to the American people, how many died under Bush?  Here, I'll give you a list:  June 14, 2002, U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan Suicide bomber kills 12 and injures 51. February 20, 2003, international diplomatic compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Truck bomb kills 17.  February 28, 2003, U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan Gunmen on motorcycles killed two consulate guards.  July 30, 2004, U.S. embassy in Taskkent, Uzbekistan Suicide bomber kills two.  December 6, 2004, U.S. consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Militants stormed and occupied perimeter wall. Five killed, 10 wounded.  March 2, 2006, U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan Suicide car bomber killed four, including a U.S. diplomate directly targeted by the assailants.  September 12, 2006, U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria Gunmen attacked embassy with grenades, automatic weapons, and a car bomb (though second truck bomb failed to detonate). One killed and 13 wounded.  January 12, 2007, U.S. embassy in Athens, Greece A rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the embassy building. No one was injured.  July 9, 2008, U.S. consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Armed men attacked consulate with pistols and shotguns. Three policemen killed.  March 18, 2008, U.S. embassy in Sana'a, Yemen Mortar attack misses embassy, hits nearby girls' school instead.  September 17, 2008, U.S. embassy in Sana'a, Yemen Militants dressed as policemen attacked the embassy with RPGs, rifles, grenades and car bombs. Six Yemeni soldiers and seven civilians were killed. Sixteen more were injured.

Mostly because they have no supporting references or actual reason attached to them.  You rely on generalities and ""beliefs"" to get them across.  To really make a valid point, you should look up and reference facts, otherwise you end up looking like and ignorant, mouth-breathing, brother-cousin who only knows what he watches on FNC because he can't be bothered to read or actually look anything up.

t5_2qtzm,ForrestGrump,1367244982,"I don’t know about the Ortho herbicides but I am somewhat familiar with Glyphosate (Roundup).  I own a hazelnut farm and we spray Glyphosate around like it’s water.  Unfortunately, I’m learning that Glyphosate may be worse than our friends at Monsanto would have us believe.  A study was published a few weeks ago which discusses the potential nastiness of Glyphosate:  [http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416](http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416)  “Beginning in around 2006, an alarming die-off of honeybees became apparent in the United States, and researchers are still struggling to understand what is causing this die-off [124]. Since the application of glyphosate also reached record levels that year, and has continued to increase since then, with no abatement in the bee colony collapse disorder, glyphosate could be playing a role in the bees' plight. While correlation does not necessary imply causation, there are strong reasons why glyphosate might interfere with bees' resistance to other environmental toxins. At first glance, pesticides might be more highly suspect, since bees are, after all, an insect. However, honeybees have an innate resistance to most pesticides, which unfortunately depends upon several CYP enzymes. For example, metabolic detoxification mediated by CYPs contributes significantly to honey bee tolerance of pyrethroid insecticides [125]. Thus, the fact that glyphosate disrupts CYP enzymes would suggest that exposure to glyphosate would leave bees especially vulnerable to pesticides in their environment, resulting in a synergistic effect. A 2005 study in Alberta (Canada) revealed a reduced wild bee abundance and highly-correlated reduced pollination in GM canola compared with organically grown canola [126], with Roundup-treated non-GM canola coming in at an intermediate level. A study comparing bees exposed to glyphosate and/or Roundup® against a control population demonstrated a significantly higher mortality rate in the glyphosate-exposed bees (p &lt; 0.001) [127]. Neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid and clothianidin can kill bees, and have been implicated in colony collapse disorder [128]. However, this toxic effect is likely synergistic in combination with glyphosate, as would occur with bees ingesting herbicide-contaminated pollen. Glyphosate is an organophosphate, and a study of human self-poisoning has demonstrated that organophosphate ingestion synergistically greatly enhances the toxicity of ingested neonicotinoids [129].” ",®

t5_2ssp3,retarredroof,1367260146,"Among northwestern California tribes, particularly the Hupa, Yurok and Karuk, crying or sobbing was an integral aspect of praying and singing of sacred songs in ritual dances. In addition, crying was recommended when praying to acquire things:  Kroeber documents instructions from Wohpekemeu (Yurok deity): ""Whoever knows this seat of mine will have good luck. Let him come at night and cry here. He will not lack money. . . . Somehow he will get dentalia easily. Whoever  thinks of me will always be lucky, and will never lack for women, because that is the kind I am. Whoever thinks of me, and knows this seat, will be well off. Let him come in the middle of the night, when no one sees him, and begin to cry while he thinks of me."" Portion of a formula from Wohpekemeu as spoken by Barney of Sregon (Yurok), circa 1901-1907 (Kroeber 1976 in Keeling 1993).

t5_2qh03,Logun0,1367262575,"When we released our very first game, Game Dev Tycoon (for Mac, Windows and Linux) yesterday, we did something unusual and as far as I know unique. We released a cracked version of the game ourselves, minutes after opening our Store.  I uploaded the torrent to the number one torrent sharing site, gave it a description imitating the scene and asked a few friends to help seed it.  A minute after we uploaded it, my torrent client looked like this:  Soon my upload speed was maxed out (and as of the time of writing still is) and my friends and I had connections from all over the world and for all three platforms! How does piracy feel?  The cracked version is nearly identical to the real thing except for one detail… Initially we thought about telling them their copy is an illegal copy, but instead we didn’t want to pass up the unique opportunity of holding a mirror in front of them and showing them what piracy can do to game developers. So, as players spend a few hours playing and growing their own game dev company, they will start to see the following message, styled like any other in-game message:      Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.     If players don’t buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.  Slowly their in-game funds dwindle, and new games they create have a high chance to be pirated until their virtual game development company goes bankrupt.  Some of the responses I found online (identities obscured to protect the guilty):      Is there some way to avoid that? I mean can I research DRM or something …  And another user:      Why are there so many people that pirate? It ruins me!  As a gamer I laughed out loud: the IRONY!!!  However, as the developer, who spent over a year creating this game and hasn’t drawn a salary yet, I wanted to cry. Surely, for most of these players, the 8 dollars wouldn’t hurt them but it makes a huge difference to our future! Trying to appeal to pirates  I know that some people just don’t even think about buying games. They will immediately search for a cracked version. For this reason, when we released the game, we also published a page which targets people who search for a cracked/illegal version. Unfortunately, due to my lack in search-engine-optimization skills, that page has had no impact yet, but I hope it will convince some to buy the game in the future.      […]if years down the track you wonder why there are no games like these anymore and all you get to play is pay-to-play and social games designed to suck money out of your pockets then the reason will stare back at you in the mirror.  I do think it’s important to try to communicate what piracy means to game developers to our consumers. I also tried to appeal to a particular forum a day earlier after someone who I gave early-access to the Store seemed to have passed on the copy to others:      We’re just a start-up and really need your support. The game is only 7.99USD, DRM free…  Clearly, my post hadn’t worked too well since on the same forum someone posted the earlier screenshot (“Why are there so many people that pirate? It ruins me!) just a bit after I made my appeal and this was followed by many others complaining about piracy.  I still hope that it made a difference to someone.  Anyway, how many really did buy and how many did pirate our game during this first day? The awesome/depressing results  Today, one day after release, our usage stats look like this:  Genuine version: 214 users  Cracked version: at least 3104 users  Over 93.6% of players stole the game. We know this because our game contains some code to send anonymous-usage data to our server. Nothing unusual or harmful. Heaps of games/apps do this and we use it to better understand how the game is played. It’s absolutely anonymous and you are covered by our privacy policy. Anyway, the cracked version has a separate ID so I can separate the data. I’m sure some of the players have firewalls and some will play offline therefore the actual number of players for the cracked version is likely much higher. To the players who played the cracked version!  I’m not mad at you. When I was younger, downloading illegal copies was practically normal but this was mostly because global game distribution was in its infancy. To be fair, there are still individuals who either can’t make a legal purchase because of payment-issues or who genuinely cannot afford the game. I don’t have a quarrel with you. To the rest who could afford the game consider this:      Would you like to see a bigger/better sequel of Game Dev Tycoon in the future? Buy the game! Creating this game was already expensive and this was just a small game. If we ever want to make a bigger/better version we need a lot of support!     Do you hate the trend towards social or pay-to-play free games? Buy games from independent developers! (start with ours :) )     Do you hate the recent trends in the industry? Buy DRM free games.  We are not wealthy and it’s unlikely that we will be any time soon, so stop pretending like we don’t need your 8 dollars! We are just two guys working our butts off, trying to start our own game studio to create games which are fun to play.  The game is DRM free, you can use it on up to three of your computers for your own use, you get copies for Mac, Windows and Linux, you can continue your game before piracy wrecked your company and we even aim to provide you with a free Steam key once the game is on Steam. All for a mere 8 bucks. Buy the game 7.99 USD, €6.49 EUR (excl. VAT)  If you just want to try the game then there’s the free DEMO: Download FREE DEMO Final words  Do we need DRM? Whether or not to use DRM isn’t clear at all to a new start-up. The main argument against it is that all it does is to inconvenience genuine customers. Fact is that any game can be cracked, so all you do is spend time on something that in the end just annoys your real customers while only slightly delaying the inevitable. The only way to protect yourself is to create an online game. I guess that’s why so many studios focus on these types of games and it’s probably a driving force to eradicate traditional single player games.  Personally, I love single players games and hope to be able to continue down this path and if more people would buy our game, we might even be able to.  Would I do this again?  This was a unique opportunity. You need a game development simulation game to make this particular joke work. The more general idea/experiment to release a cracked version which inconveniences and counts pirates can probably work for any game and might work in the long run.  If pirates are put through more trouble than genuine customers, maybe more will buy the real game. Sadly, for AAA games it is currently the other way. Customers get the trouble with always-on requirements and intrusive DRM, while pirates can just download and enjoy. A twisted world. To our genuine customers  Thank you for your support. Your purchase is more important to us than you might think. We hope to be able to bring you more games in the future. Also, please update to the latest version of the game by using the download link from your purchase email. Before writing this blog post I’ve fixed most of the known issues :)  Patrick Klug - Greenheart Games ♥  If you want to comment on this post, please do so on our forum.

t5_2t5qh,JuzamDjinn,1367268330,"I had quite a bit more time to play this week than the past few weeks. My group of friends and I are continuing on our **Rayman: Origins** quest every Monday as we are wont to do. I also played a little bit of **Payday: The Heist** last Monday. It's seems alright, but the few matches I played I was stuck with people who had no idea what they were doing and my experience was lesser for it. I think I'll just stick with **Left 4 Dead 2** or **Killing Floor** for my co-op shooter needs. I've also continued on playing **Skate 3** and some **Forza 4** as a way of staying up date to date with my podcast feeds. Other than that I did play a little bit of **E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy**. That game seems completely bananas in way a can really get behind, but it's also incredibly janky. It has probably the worst controller implementation of any PC and the default KB&amp;M setup is incredibly strange, enemies see and shoot you from miles away and the tutorial system is lackluster to put it nicely. Other that though, it seems pretty rad in that ""this game isn't great but is just quirky enough to enjoy"" kind of way so I'll probably play some more of that this week. If you're interested you may want to check out the [Giant Bomb quick look](http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/quick-look-eye-divine-cybermancy/2300-4682/) before you drop some money on it.  I should mention that I am by means an expert on either of these genres, but I love both dearly and while these may not be the exact paths I have taken, they are the ones that make the most sense to me now. Onto my two genre classes.  *Fighting Games 101* The first game that I would recommend to someone as their foray into modern fighting games would be **Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown**. It is available on XBLA and PSN and I think it is the best introduction to the genre. The controls are dead simple, and the combo system is easy to understand and digest. The main things you should learn from this game are the basic movement within a 3D fighter (despite the fact that most competitive fighting games of 2D/2.5D) and a basic understanding of how to chain hits together into a combo as well as other related ideas such as hit confirming and canceling. The above average training mode should help you reach these goals. Onto the next assignment if you will. **Mortal Kombat** (the most recent one). This could be a bit of nostalgia creeping in on me, but I feel it is a much more approachable 2D fighter than Street Fighter at this point. This game will serve as your introduction to projectiles and by association the concept of zoning. MK should also help you learn when and how to execute anti-air attacks (the simple uppercut is another reason I picked MK over SF and it's shoryuken) and juggling. Juggling will not be as essential in other fighting games, but getting a grasp on it here certainly won't hurt you in the long run. And for your final game in your Intro to Fighting™, will be **EA Sports MMA**. Now hold on, HOLD ON! I know this may seem like an absurd recommendation for learning proper fighting games but I have a good reason for it to be here so stick with me. Ok? This is the game that really taught me how to read and react to an opponent more so than any other fighting game I have played. When you let your opponent get through with several punishing blows and a successful takedown it will teach how important reading them is without you throwing away an entire round. In a game like MK if you let a good opponent land a solid combo on you it's very likely you'll lose fifty percent of your health if not more which can be off-putting. In EA MMA you'll know when you've screwed up and you'll regret it, but you won't feel like it's impossible to come back. A lot of the game's ground system also revolves around you quickly responding to your opponent's pressure, so this game is, in my opinion at least, a great to improve your reaction time as well as how you capitalize on those reactions. I should also add here, that it is very likely EA MMA will be replaced by **Divekick** when it comes out as it seems like it will be quicker, and sillier, way of learning this skill set (Fun fact: Jeff Gerstmann's talking about using Divekick to ""relearn"" fighting games on last week's Bombcast was what inspired this discussion question). With all those things under your metaphorical belt you should be ready to graduate up to the fighting games people take way more seriously, whether it's deserved or not, such as Street Fighter (go with 4 first and then you can work back to 3rd Strike or 2). and MvC (3 or 2 depending on your preference).

t5_2qh2p,immentrapture1,1367276423,"REVELATIONS ABOUT THE FALLEN ANGELS BY THE ALMIGHTY GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB. IN THIS TIME THE LORD REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE CHAMELEONS, THAT ARE INTENDING THE DESTRUCTION OF MAN! Please share and do not change © BC Full view: Welcome! On March 19th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen. Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Barinco, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. Verily, listen attentively! The fallen angels belong to satan, and masquerade as angels of light, just like satan. Through their spaceships one uses a virtual image projection mover, that allows them to be able to move themselves. The following are characteristics of fallen angels... They have a piercing look, an inner eye, as it were, of satan himself. They have a higher consciousness than man, and a higher technological knowledge. They express kindness, understanding and experience like angels, and they communicate among themselves by telepathic means. Their goal is the total takeover of man. They feel strongly connected to the earth, and are relatives of Lucifer. Their length is 7 feet 10 inches. They want to influence human, because they hate the creation of God. Genesis 1, verse 27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them. From the beginning satan was against it, that the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham made man in His image! For this reason they still resist, by influencing man among others, by conveying thoughts that go in against God. Colossians 2, verse 15, and Luke 1, verse 70 and 71, and Ephesians 6, verse 13 Read this aloud. Colossians 2, verse 15 Here it is written: And having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Luke 1, verse 70 and 71 Here it is written: As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old, Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us. Ephesians 6, verse 13 Here it is written: Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. Verily, also many souls who have rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, will burn in hell, but Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, just wants to save man only! The fallen angels, on the opposite, will first go destroy everything, what God brought together. Only by surrendering yourself and repenting of your worldly walk, with remorse, you can be saved. He can save you today, if you have not yet made a choice. Even though you are also a Christian in the great tribulation, even then only the strongest ones will conquer! Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20, and John 3, verse 16 Read this aloud. Ephesians 6, verse 16 to 20 Here it is written: Above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints: on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. John 3, verse 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. Verily, it is up to you what you'll do with this message. Not to choose for Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, means to perish! He who does not want to hear, will go lost. I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared. I would also advise you to download and copy the messages with this topic, and to keep it as information. Perhaps you are a Christian and you trust on the Rapture, but think also of the people, that you care a lot about, and who does not want to know anything of it. It will be a good source of information! They can still always become a Christian after the Rapture. Only then it will be very difficult - like this message says - to be strong and maintain, in.............. PLEASE, SEND ME A MESSAGE FOR THE COMPLETE TEXT.",©

To me, it does have that icey watery taste to it. It's techinically ""ice milk"", I believe is what they call it.   Here's what they say from the website  &gt;Technically, our soft serve does not qualify to be called ice cream. To be categorized as ice cream, the minimum butterfat content must be ten percent, and our soft serve has only five percent butterfat content. While our soft serve product used to be categorized as “ice milk,” the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) eliminated this category of product to allow companies the ability to market frozen dairy products as “reduced-fat,” “light,” and “low-fat” ice cream.  &gt;DQ® soft serve fits into the “reduced-fat” ice cream category and our shake mix qualifies as “low-fat” ice cream. But, even though our soft serve may have been categorized differently in the past, our recipe has not changed. DQ soft serve contains 5% butterfat, which is not the same as 95% fat-free.  So it's not custard, and since it is low-fat, it isn't very thick or creamy. Personally, I'm not a big fan.",®

THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN PASSED ON 100% PURE, WORD FOR WORD, TO PROPHET BENJAMIN COUSIJNSEN BY MICHAËL! GET READY! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On April 19th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on this important prophetic message of God to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, beloved prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am the messenger angel Michaël, and was truly sent to God's beloved prophet.  We angels of God would remind you, that at the moment you notice, that your loved one, who did allow Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is gone - while you thought your loved one and all those Christians were insane - you will beat your breast. Verily, unexpectedly all those 'insane' are being snatched away, and do you really think that you were right, or were those Christians, who have accepted Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, not so insane after all?  How about this? It was revealed to Benjamin Cousijnsen on December 6, 2012, that, at the moment when Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, will sound first, the trumpets are being set in thereby by the angels, who will make the sound complete. This sound is so penetrating, that all Christians will feel the vibration of the sound, even in their spirit!  The whole sky will be full of lightning bolts! A strong magnetic power of God will snatch away the Christians. This will be beyond understanding. Even animals and people with a disability, and even the innocent babies will also be taken away from this wicked world.  You, who were speaking about your insane beloved, and said: ""All those Christians are crazy!"", you will reconsider immediately. For this, what is coming then, will be worse than any war that has ever been. Fireballs will come down, which will strike everywhere, on the roofs and streets. Explosions will be everywhere, and even toxic substances will be released. Helicopters and airplanes out of control, anything that flies without driver, will crash. You, who have rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, will curse His birth! Many commit suicide, because of that one realizes, that they've always been proved wrong. They will cry heartbreaking to Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. There will then be one of the biggest famines!  The visitors from space, they will fool the people that the Christians, the haters, have been destroyed by them. Verily, the Christian hatred is now already increasing fast, worldwide! Benjamin also saw a blood red moon, which was bleeding, which was very damaged and was showing holes, where bright light came through.    Verily, the moment that the Christians are gone, one will land with UFOs. Consider the following for yourself: Is it not insane, that you do not repent and be saved?  Read aloud: John 3, verse 17 Here it is written: For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  The choice is yours! In the days of the snatching away, an offer will be offered to you one more time, but you will have a very tough time. Also, I tell you, a baby baptism is but only a blessing, but you are also not saved with that. You must be born again and undergo an adult baptism, and have remorse from your sins. This is God's rescue plan for you, your only way out and salvation!  Read aloud: John 3, verse 16 and verse 18 Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PASSES ON THIS MESSAGE, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND COME TO CHRIST, YOUR ONLY SAVIOR! Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! On December 30th, 2012, the angel of the Lord, the messenger angel of God, brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen. I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. My name is Rinearinda. Verily, verily, I tell you,  Mark 3, verse 23 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can satan cast out satan?  Verily,  Luke 10, verse 18 And he said unto them, I beheld satan, ""in Hebrew: baraq, spoke the angel of the Lord"", as lightning fall from heaven.  2 Corinthians 11, verses 14 and 15 And no wonder, for ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord,"" even satan masquerades as an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ""taken over, the angel of the Lord said,"" ministers also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.  Isaiah 14, verse 12 to 14 How you have fallen from Heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! ""You play a game with the world! spoke the angel of the Lord"". You said in your heart, ""I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!"" Verily,  Matthew 24, verse 25 to 26 Behold, I have told you beforehand. If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the desert,' ""Barack Obama, said the angel of the Lord"", don't go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,' ""this chameleon, said the angel of the Lord"", don't believe it. ""It is satan personally! said the angel of the Lord"".  Matthew 24, verses 27 and 28 For as the lightning, ""Barack Obama, spoke the angel of the Lord"", comes forth from the east, and shines even unto the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures be gathered together.  Verily, Obama came from the East, in order to make a career, and this is now the fallen lightning! In secret much is prepared now, so that one will assume the 'solution' of Obama en masse and with open arms: the number of the beast, 666! Also, many gallows for the FEMA camps has been transferred worldwide, from America, signed by... Obama!    Also, the New World Order has had meetings worldwide, together with the royal house and some of the government and other leaders! Verily,  James 5, verse 7 to 9 Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, ""blow not along with all winds. Truly, he is the prophet! spoke the angel of the Lord"", for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.   Verily, you there, Jesus Christ has everything ready for His children already. The God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham has indicated, that His Son will soon know the point of time and the hour!   Matthew 11, verse 28 Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.  Benjamin, January 30, you become older. In heaven one is always having his birthday, and one has eternal life, one does not know an old age.  I'm going now, God's beloved prophet, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

t5_2qhpn,mkvgtired,1367295736,"I am just copying and pasting a previous comment on this (how Greece is laying off government employees due to cuts). Some countries didn't have the option:  Austerity is much different in the US, UK, Germany, etc. than in a place like Greece. Greece is the definition of a country that ran out of other peoples' money. In February of last year their short term borrowing [rate hit roughly 1200%](http://i.imgur.com/vYsm6UL.png) (© Bloomberg).   Talking about how austerity will hurt the economy is moot if its impossible to keep these employees on otherwise. The Greeks that are drawing swastikas on Merkel's face dont seem to realize without German money *many* more of them would be unemployed. Germany, the ECB, and the IMF were their last hope unless they wanted to default (which would also result in severe unemployment).  I think they should have defaulted, but it would have definitely put a lot of Europe in a worse position. Many prominent banks heavily invested in Greek government debt because of the higher yields and the assumption it was safe because the Eurozone members wouldnt let them default. So Greece and Europe would have been much worse off in the short term, but it would force European banks to start building up healthy assets.   I have to note, a Greek default could spread to other European nations because they would be forced to bail out their banks (one of the reasons for France's downgrade was exposure to this). So above I am talking about a *best* case scenario if Greece had a full default. Worst case it could plunge much of Europe into a recession or even a prolonged depression because of the domino effect it could have.   **TL;DR: We can debate austerity in countries that have the option to implement it or not. In Greece's case, its back was against the wall, it had only two options, both resulting in forced austerity.**",©

If their argument is that ""something can't come from nothing"" (which is a misrepresentation of what the big bang theory states anyway), shouldn't that apply to God as well?  2) God is not the origin of morals. Your boss undoubtedly wouldn't kill you for working on a Sunday (Exodus 35: 2) or stone her daughter to death for not being a virgin when she marries (Deuteronomy 22: 20-21). The mechanism which allows us to reject these precepts does not originate in scripture - it's in us♣.  3) *We* aren't miserable. Case closed on that one, really.  ♣ as a footnote, it's also worth noting that various studies conducted on animals have lead researchers to believe that precursors to true ethical concerns and behavior have been demonstrated by several different species of animal; lending credence to the theory that morals are, in part, a product of evolution.

t5_2szyo,Bleedmaster,1367308286,"PART 2 OF GENERICNATE'S QUESTION  OK...... The volume of Earths oceans is 1.37 billion cubic kilometers. Translating this into measuring cups (standard 8 ounce cup), you get 22,617,336,000,000,000,000 cups of water - 22.6 million trillion, give or take a little. This would be over 3.2 billion cups (200 million gallons) for each and every person on the planet.  1 cup water = 235.6 cm^3 = .2366 liters = .2366 kg = 236.6 g  molecular mass of water is 18 g/mol, so:  (236.6 g) / (18g/mol) = 13 mols  Avagadro's number gives us  13*6*10^23 =   7.8*10^24 molecules of water in a cup of water  compared to  2.2*10^19 cups of water in the ocean  So.....  that's a factor of about 3.5*10^5 = 350000  so there's over a quarter million times more molecules in a cup of water than there are cups of water on the planet.  (notice, I ignored that it was saltwater, but I don't think you can overcome that factor of a quarter million with the adjustments)  Again, A mole of water is about 18 grams of water and is 6x10^23 molecules. so a glass (say 180 ml) is 6 x 10^24 molecules.  or 600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules  So already the numbers are very promising due to the sheer quantity.  However, to address the problem of distribution I will say this:  a mole of water (18ml) has 6.02x10^23 molecules. That's a hell of a lot. Considering individual gas and liquid molecules **can move very quickly**, I would not be surprised if any single molecule has long since been dispersed around the world. But curb this opinion because more concrete facts are on the way.  Also, Periodically, water molecules will split into H+ and OH- and can then react with other ions. So an ABSOLUTE FUCK TON of mixing goes on. A lot of water is also removed semi-permanently by forming insoluble compounds, which will eventually become a part of something else.  Result This means there is 1322.59 times more molecules in one 8 fl.oz. glass of water than there is glasses of water in the oceans of Earth. **Combine this with the water cycle and how much water a person drinks in a lifetime, and take it as you like.**  But this is not yet enough to adequately satisfy one understandably skeptical inquired mind on forming an opinion from more of a ""scrutiny-surviving"" peer reviewed-like **certainty** the aforementioned natural molecular distributions can provide.  So, lets add to this...  To add the nail in the coffin I will simply, for the sake of laziness and to provide an advantage of better articulation by virtue of using data sourced from Copyright ©2004 by Jupiter Scientific, I leave you with this to eradicate any previous doubt you may have on the subject of this aforementioned amazing factoid. Here it is:  An Estimate of the Number of Shakespeare's Atoms  in a Living Human Being  I. The General Mathematical Analysis  With reasonable assumptions, it is possible to estimate the number of atoms in one's body that originated from within William Shakespeare. There are three sources of Shakespearean atoms: (i) those produced at the time of his death, (ii) those breathed out during his lifetime and (iii) and those that exited in the form of solid, liquid and gaseous waste (Please avoid imaginative thought here) while he was alive. It turns out that source (i) is considerably smaller than sources (ii) and (iii). Let S be the total number of atoms that originated from Shakespeare and entered the environment.   **VERY IMPORTANT:**  ** **Most of these source atoms are rapidly dispersed. For example, winds and weather thoroughly mix atmospheric molecules around the world within a FEW MONTHS. Any atoms entering the ocean are thoroughly distributed within a FEW YEARS. The same is true of waste that is processed by microbes. Rain, evaporation and other natural processes also lead to molecular exchanges among oceans, land and air.****       Let E be the total number of atoms in the environment. Then the probability P that such an atom came from Shakespeare is  P = S/E  ",©

You're in character from when we get on the plane until we return."" I had a couple of cameras following him, shooting constantly, with the producer following us with release forms. Kip would go to a party as Victor, who is a complete ********! Yet, for some reason, girls were always gravitating towards him. Very briefly I'd explain what we were doing, I'd show them some mini DVD footage, we'd get releases, Kip would fall back into character and we'd continue. Invariably, we'd end up at the hotel room with these girls and I'd be shooting this stuff thinking,""This is insane... and ethically questionable.""  And then it was turned into [a movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitterati_(film\)) that has yet to be released:  &gt;Glitterati is a 2004 film directed by Roger Avary assembled from the 70 hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of The Rules of Attraction in October of 2002, after the events of 9/11. It serves to expand upon the very minimally detailed and rapidly recapped story told by the character of Victor Ward (portrayed by Kip Pardue, featured in Avary's other film The Rules of Attraction ) upon his return to the United States after having traveled extensively around Europe.  edit: and I just realized that Avary has a fantastic write-up in the description of the video posted above:  &gt;For this sequence, from The Rules of Attraction (2002), I directed Kip Pardue to remain in character as the vacant, vapid, and self-absorbed Victor from the moment we stepped onto the plane to Europe until the moment we returned to Los Angeles. A blinding twelve cities in two weeks shooting every possible moment on a Sony PD-150. It was an endurance test. I told Kip that I would have 24/7 access -- no matter how intimate the situation. With no script, and the loosest of plans, I tracked Victor as he partied across Europe in the shell-shocked weeks following 9/11. We would be raving with Paul Oakenfold one day in Dublin, and then at a Ford model party in Paris the next. Five minutes into a conversation with, say, an heiress or a model, I would stop shooting, explain who we were, that Victor was actually the actor Kip Pardue, and that we were shooting a scene for my latest film, The Rules of Attraction. Our only other crew member, Academy Award™-winning Producer Greg Shapiro, would then step forward and get them to sign a waiver, and then Victor would proceed to dawn. I didn't sleep more than a few hours those two weeks. Months later, Kip would receive calls from the various girls Victor had hooked up with who were confused as to what was real and what wasn't. Who were we? Where is Victor? I cut the 70 hours of footage down to these 4 minutes which I cut into the film. Years later I decided to form the unused footage into a musical tone-film of all it's own: Glitterati.",™

t5_2ug83,statue_junction,1367326401,"Total honesty? Well, it requires some history. Let's start from the beginning.   I was bullied a lot as a kid by both my classmates and especially my older brother. I was constantly reminded of what was wrong with me (too fat, too tall, too nerdy, not smart enough, not cool enough, spaz) and I developed a serious inferiority complex. Everyone wants respect, right? Nothing new about that. But it became a desperate hunger for me. All I could think about was proving to everyone that I'm worth something. That was my life goal.  This desire for respect turned into something else over the years. I became spiteful and bitter and eventually just convinced myself that everyone was wrong and that I was actually awesome, and fuck them, and what do they know, and everyone is stupid but me.   You always hear counselors and parents say the same shit. ""Don't listen to them, they're just jealous, they're wrong"" etc etc and I wanted it to be true so badly that I developed this huge paper ego that took over my life. I did a lot of stupid, asshole shit. I acted like my farts didn't stink and made sure everyone knew. I was the typical ""arrogant nerd"" and of course everyone found it obnoxious, which just made things even worse. My fight for respect was a constant uphill battle.  So then I meet a girl that likes me and thinks I'm cool to be around. A GIRL. It's like: what? Doesn't she know I'm a fat spaz? The little bullied kid inside me freaks *the fuck* out and Mr. Paper Ego falls apart in little ribbons. I get attached to her. I open up to her. Sunlight peeks through the cracks.   But of course that only dooms me, because the kind of undeveloped emotions I had can't handle the obligation of human affection. And... when things inevitably don't work, the bullied kid can't deal. He just. Can't. Deal. Total meltdown.  All the pain I felt as a kid, all the rationalizations I relied on to keep from breaking down, all the lies I told to feel like a Cool Bro^© came flooding back and I just couldn't BELIEVE that anyone would NOT want me in their lives because THEY HAD to want it. Their wanting it was necessary for my survival. The only alternative was the unthinkable:  *Everyone else was right about me.*  And that was out of the question. To accept that is pretty much the end for me, so I ran as far away from that thought as hard as I could, and this girl turned into some... god, saying ""monument"" feels like an understatement, but there you go. She was a god damn monument and she dominated the horizon for a long, long time.   Like I said, eventually I met someone who was patient and wise enough to help me deal with my absurd self esteem issues, even if they've just developed into a keen and humorous self-loathing. All this was years ago and I'm a pretty functional adult now, though I still have a hard time with relationships. It's just the opposite problem now: I'm too distant LOL  Hopefully this helps you understand why a guy like OP's ex-boyfriend may act the way he acts. Understand, but not necessarily forgive. I have a hard time feeling sympathy for these kind of guys just because of how disgusted it makes me feel about myself. They really should know better, and I can say this because I definitely could have known better.  So, fuck that guy basically. He needs to get over himself",©

t5_2qh0u,Gummy_Joe,1367327880,"You seem set on assuming that everybody who needs a handout or a helping hand up is somebody who screwed up majorly, who either squandered what they had or didn't try. The fact is most people on social welfare either need it because they're elderly and can't work, are disabled in some way, or are hard workers who actually do need a helping hand up. Everybody tends to assume that everyone on social welfare is a loser dropout who sits at home collecting money from the taxpayers and contributing nothing to society, and that's simply not how it is in America, or anywhere else for that matter. People have a lot more pride in themselves than you're willing to give them. But pride will only get you so far. You can keep harping on this idea that people who want it and work hard enough will be able to basic things like insurance, but here's the kicker: Insurance, good decent insurance, isn't priced like a basic thing like food or shelter, nor is it even close to regulated at that level. It's priced like a luxury, which means that plenty of good hard workers who want it bad enough STILL can't afford insurance. That's the entire point right there, that the things that seem simple and should be readily available at a decent price to everybody, like good health care and a good education, aren't. 62% of bankruptcies in America come from health care bills, and among that 62% of filers, most of them were well-educated, owned homes, employed in middle-class occupations, and had health insurance. I don't know about you, but I tend to think people in the middle class have at least some of that Want and Hard Work that you seem to have. So why should they suffer because of an unfair, horribly overpriced system?  Nobody does is an exaggeration by itself. Of course their are exceptions, but the general rule is that people don't move from their perch. I'm still waiting for some sort of factual evidence from you that actually backs up your assertion. As it stands, if somebody actually wanted to clamber out of their lower class economic shell and into something much bigger and better, they'd be better off going to Canada. Trumpeting America as THE place to do it has already been shown to be patently false, given the low levels of income elasticity compared to Canada and some other countries in Western Europe, so really I'm just waiting for some sort of contradicting evidence you might have that shows that America actually is not all that bad.  Yes, that is precisely what Donald Trump did. He has gone bankrupt numerous times, and if he was anybody but Donald Trump®, if he was a Middle Class Donald Trump, he'd be done and never heard from again. But because he was born into wealth and prestige, he keeps on going. He didn't earn a damn thing. His freaking father gave him $3 million to keep his famous Trump Casino from being foreclosed on ffs. His fabled negotiation skill and business savvy are the things that made him go bankrupt, not the reasons he's wealthy. The reason he's wealthy is because his father was wealthy, because, again, there is little income elasticity in America. The wealthy stay wealthy, the poor stay poor, everybody stays where they are.",®

(this is also jesus talking)  And I realize Paul was not alive while Jesus was on earth, but even he maintained these ideas and is one of the most prolific teachers in Christianity,  before Muhammad was around. (Peace be upon them)  Some think Paul distorted Jesus message, but im not sure how they get to that conclusion. All early christians certainly didnt agree on certain aspects of Jesus, but i think saying they didnt see him as a savior/messiah/dieing for sins is kinda silly.  I guess that all depends on how accurate the new testament is. If you are throwing it out the window though I would wonder where you are getting your ideas about their beliefs.",©
t5_2uc6j,BatiDari,1367330020,"**Part 2**  &gt;Q: Did you get info on the cockpits from the Gaijin or did you have to ask them for it?  A: Kind of yeah! Developers are not very happy to give very early sneak peaks and some times its hard to explain that those do look great and community would love to see it in progress.  ---  &gt;Q: Will Instructor be removed from our sign in historic battles?  A: Yes, we working on something.  ---  &gt;Q: What developers going to do about displeased players?  A: Its not easy to make everyone happy, but we trying to make game better.   ---  &gt;Q: Will there be a wipe of in game stats?  A: As for now – we dont plan any type of wipe.  ---  &gt;Q: Will it be possible to create custom battles on Gaijin server instead of peer-to-peer as it now?  A: I dont know.  ---  &gt;Q: Will there be a new way to determinate kills and assists? Right now kill awarded not for the person who did most damage, but player who hit the plane last. You cannot move away from plane, because otherwise you wont even get assist for that. Can we have some kind of timer so we can leave plane to teammates and still get the credit?  A: There is no such thing as 'health of the plane' in game. Damage model is quite complex and there are different types of damage that you can inflict to enemy plane. If, for example, you set enemy plane engine on fire and it was slowly burning out for a while – you will get credit for its kill even though you wasnt one who technically finished him off. A couple of months ago I was explaining in detail about how the damage system works. About different hits and crits. About the timer you mentioned – its actually present in the game. Once you crit the plane the timer starts and, if I am not mistaken, during 20 seconds this frag will be yours. We do plan to increase quantity of critical points on the planes in future, but for now my suggestion would be to inflict as much damage as you can during your assault to secure your kills.  ---  &gt;Q: About ammunition. What is difference in damage between incendiary and armor piercing shells and how that damage is actually reflected in algorithm?  A: Well its in name. The incendiary bullets have more chance to set enemy on fire, but low chance to actually pierce the armor of the plane. When you shoot low armored planes, like one made of wood, it will probably will work better than armor piercing shells. You have more chance to set plane on fire and get all bonuses of progressive damage on the enemy plane. When you fight against armored targets, where everything is protected by armor plates – its probably better to use armor piercing shells instead. But it also depends on your playstyle. Generally higher tiers have better armor than lower tiers, so it could be a good idea to use armor piercing and hight explosive shells.  ---  &gt;Q: About squad size. Will there be more than 4 people in one squad?  A: Yes, we want bigger squad sizes and we just working on better client system to support that.  ---  &gt;Q: Any idea when official wiki will be done?  A: As far as I aware wiki is 80% ready. Leader of the wiki said that they already ready to open it up for the people, but we want to complete it before that, add new information and other stuff first. In game wiki will be ready really soon and official War Thunder wiki is incoming.  ---  &gt;Q: Are you going to make a feature when if you critted someone (for example took elevator off) – you would get the kill?  A: The critical damages are not invented by us, but we took them from historical data. Those damages that were critical to plane survival will award you a kill. We constantly improving list of possible critical damages and as for now – just make sure you inflicted enough damage to secure you a kill. In your example, the game thinks that broken elevator wasnt reason the plane crashed.  ---  &gt;Q: When is the pay safe method of payment coming?  A: As you know we now how Q&amp;A sections every two weeks. Last time we even had the head of the company – Anton Yudincev who was on Team Speak with us. He was answering different questions about pay systems. As far as I know negotiations are happening and probably they are just take too long. Pay safe is really promising, but I cannot answer when it will happen.  ---  &gt;Q: Anyone used War Thunder combat joystick?  A: Developers have them in office and as far as I aware are using them.  ---  &gt;Q: Did you take out engine burning animation from cockpit perspective? Or why is it not visible?  A: I dont know.  ---  &gt;Q: To battle menu have an option for the domination, ground strike and operation in it. Are those tabs expected to be implemented in the next patch?  A: Dont know. We not supposed to speak about future stuff in here, but as to when – its going to be soon ™.  ---  &gt;Q: I have 80% win rate as historical battle Germans and 40% as US and UK. Is it balance issue and if it is – will it be addressed in next patch?  A: I`m not sure about next patch. We have two good German planes in game as far as I know, and they are very good fighters.  Messerschmidt and Focke-Wolf. They have cannons and inflict too much pain for Americans and Britains. This balance at the moment is awful, I agree.   ---  &gt;Q: Will there be a chance that locust tanks will be dropped from the bombers?  A: Probably not. At least not until we have tanks playable in the game. It would be epic, though.  ---  &gt;Q: Will weather equipped planes have an advantage in bad weather and rain?   A: For now, if I not mistaken, it have no actual effect, but idea is in consideration. Will it be implemented or not – we just dont know.  ---  &gt;Q: Will airfields be strengthened in hour long games?  A: I dont know answer, but it probably should be put into suggestion forum. Guys from developing team do look at those suggestions and ideas and from my opinion this suggestion is very good one. At the moment its too easy to destroy enemy airfield especially if players have heavy-load bombers in their setup. ",™

Okay, so I would have a muscle you could use to knock yourself out immediately. This would be handy for loads of reasons, but the biggest one - for me at least - is for nights when you're up super late studying and have to be up for class at 8. ""Okay, it's 3 AM now and if I work another hour then go to sleep, I'll get four hours of sleep!""  Yeah, okay. No you won't. You'll sit there in the darkness shouting in your head at yourself for not sleeping. Eventually you realize how much work you might as well be doing. Finally you give up on being even remotely well rested as you glance at the glowing 5:15 on the clock. Next thing you know, you're awake and the last thing you remember is all the negative thoughts you had right before you drifted off. Your day is ruined, pal.  Nevermore with the snooze muscle™. Work until your heart's content - knowing full well that the second you wrap it up, just clench a little and POW.  This muscle would be similar to the muscle you use for peeing. No worries about letting it happen in the middle of the day - you'd be used to subconsciously controlling it.  Can't say much for toddlers who aren't potty-trained.

t5_2qlqh,3nderr,1367341455,"I too am like xpose, waiting anxiously for a Verizon HTC One. While I can't say I had a *horrible* experience with the TBolt, it was my first smartphone, so maybe I was jaded by it. I can still remember the excitement I had to see the 4G icon come up as Verizon finally deployed 4G in my area. In fact I was so happy with it I even made my own [ad poster](http://500px.com/photo/31915137?from=set/761099) as a silly little graphics project based on [an old Star Wars poster](http://imgur.com/VyOiEmD).  Lately though, it seems the old TBolt is deteriorating. Having to reset the 4G and even restart the phone completely to get data working sometimes. My patience for it is quickly wearing thin, but still I hold out. Waiting for the glorious HTC One.  Everything that I see about the HTC One, more and more I want it. The thoughts are beginning to take over my mind. I must has it.. My.. **precious..** I must hold strong! Ever vigilant in my efforts to maintain some sense of sanity despite my failing Tbolt. I signed up for email updates from our glorious leader, HTC. In hopes that an announcement will come across my email screen, checking it ceremoniously every morning. Scouring 'The Google' for various postings about any kind of update that might signify His Coming. The weeks grew longer.. More and more time passed. Devastated to see the ""official twitter post"" denouncing us back in March, and subsequently overjoyed to find that it wasn't true. Secretly, I knew all along our glorious leader, HTC, would never abandon us Verizonites. I maintained hope in my precious’ pre-release that there might be some off chance that a Verizon version came with it after all, or even just an announcement of His Coming. Days went by, hours like days and days like weeks. Surely, our time is coming.. *my precious…*  Finally a spark! A glimmer of hope! My email shone brightly the glowing pixels from our glorious leader, HTC, an announcement of my *precious’* pre-release. My heartbeat skipped and pulsed rapidly. Nervously opening the email, but... there was no hope here. A false prophet, speaking of the way of the ATT and Mr. Tmobile. My psyche cracked, desperately I clawed at the screen. I hurled money at it viciously, but it was no use. The beautiful.. *precious* 64g Dev Edition, a false shepherd. My heart sank, but a small glint of hope remained in ‘The Google’. For surely, an announcement was to be found now, a speaking of my precious’ coming. My fingers raced with the speed of a Korean SC gosu and slammed into the keyboard with the force of five thousand FPS gamers pounding their shift key to sprint. The microseconds it took to pull the search were like days, agony, torture but the final result.. Nothing... Empty. Null. **Void.**  ..my... precious.... pr.. e.. ciouses...  **Day 137** – The datalifestream seems to have come down to a trickle now, the Virzonites have begun to lose hope. It grows harder each day to hold on. A tattered thread we cling to. An elusive carrot ever so out of reach, is it even there at all?

If you encrypt first youâ€™ll have nothing but random data to work with, which will destroy any potential benefit from compression.”  Correct, but not the best answer. Compression removes or reduces patterns in the plaintext leading to a ""stronger"" ciphertext since (1) the compressed plaintext is much smaller creating less ciphertext to be created and (2) the compressed plaintext introduces more randomness into the encryption process.",™

t5_2qh0u,Art4All,1367348351,"I would like to shed a little light on this subject, as I was the MnemeTherapist who helped this woman paint this picture.  My name is Larry Homan, MMT and I work in MN. MnemeTherapy® is a process that has been used for over 8 years with people that have various brain disorders including Alzheimer's, dementia, stroke recovery, Autism, ASD and many other neurological disorders so we are relatively new on the scene.  As MnemeTherapists, our job is to get information from the brain and give information to the brain through a process called ""directed painting"". We put the paint on the paper and then give the client instructions as to how and where to move the brush. Some individuals are able to do everything we direct. Others are not and so we gently guide them (show and let go).  MnemeTherapy® uses everyday pleasures such as singing, movement, painting and story telling in a unique combination to stimulate dramatic changes in the brain. Although our goal is to provide a rewarding experience, documented testimonies show significant improvement in some clients in verbal skills, mobility, combativeness, spatial acuity, understanding instructions plus much more!  For more information, please visit our website: http://artwithoutboundaries.net/  I believe the person who submitted the original posting was misinformed as to the actual process that took place. People generally don't have massive strokes and then become fabulous painters. The woman who painted this had help. I hope this clears up the confusion for all who are viewing this posting.

Google Wallet   * While you give a summary of how NFC works (the device-to-device data transfer paradigm), this isn't an accurate description of Google Wallet.   * Not all devices with NFC support Google Wallet. In fact, you include a link to the devices Google Wallet supports in a later footnote.  *  Re: I. Verizon's Policy [...]   * You cite text from the ISIS app (sourcing Droid-Life) and claim ""the ISIS consortium’s mobile payment application in fact takes advantage of the secure element"", which implies both ISIS and Wallet use the same means, instead of disclosing that they, in fact, do not. ISIS uses the Secure Element of the NFC-SIM whereas Google wanted exclusive proprietary use of the built-in secure element.     * See the Isis FAQ under ""	How do I know my information in the Isis Mobile Wallet™ is safe?"": http://support.verizonwireless.com/faqs/Features%20and%20Optional%20Services/isis.html  * Re: A. Google Wallet's interaction [...]   * The last sentence here cites Verizon's claim regarding interaction with their network, which is not a claim that appears in Verizon's statements. They did make a claim regarding the proprietary nature of the hardware, but you haven't argued against that claim, you made one up about the network.  ***  I seem to have missed anything where Verizon cited the specific exception to the C-block rules they're using to prevent Google Wallet; if you could share that information I'd appreciate it. If the information doesn't exist, however, with what basis are you determining counterarguments regarding specific sections of the Block C Regulations?  Unfortunately, I feel like the crux of the issue is going to rely on §27.16(c)(2), which is a gray area for the reasons you've outlined, but I also feel Verizon finds themselves in the right because Google is pushing an exclusive proprietary use of the hardware (seeing as, to my knowledge, there's no way for anyone to use the Secure Element for their own purposes).  &gt;I, in fact, do have enough knowledge to absolutely say, Verizon cannot be doing what they're doing.   It's also difficult considering the third-person perspective we have, since we don't know what Verizon and Google are discussing, specifically the requirements Verizon is giving Google and the changes Google is willing to make (i.e. changing Wallet to use the NFC-SIM secure element instead).

t5_2qh1i,nooneisreal,1367357561,"I went through my old emails and found the contest.  It was called 'iCoke ""NESTEA SWEEPS AND INSTANT WIN""'   It was a Canadian contest hosted on iCoke.ca website.  Basically you would enter a pin code (or use the non-pin entry form) to enter into the draw every day. At the end of the draw there were three grand prizes of $10,000 each.  Each day there were a bunch of instant win prizes you could get if you happened to enter right when that prize was being given away.  These were the daily instant win prizes:  &gt;92 First Prizes (1 per day): $1,000 cash. ARV: $1,000 CND.   &gt;920 Second Prizes (10 per day): NESTEA for a Year (awarded as 52 coupons for Nestea 12 packs). ARV: $363 CND.   &gt;920 Third Prizes (10 per day): 2,000 iCoke Points™. ARV: iCoke Points™ have no monetary value, but can be accumulated and redeemed in accordance with the terms set out at iCoka.ca.   &gt;920 Fourth Prizes (10 per day): 1,000 iCoke Points™. ARV: iCoke Points™ have no monetary value, but can be accumulated and redeemed in accordance with the terms set out at iCoka.ca.  The contest ran for like 5 months or something and there was no limit to the number of instant win prizes you could win. So I ended up winning the coupons and a few of the icoke points over the course of the contest.   Sadly, I never won the $1000 instant win or the grand prize.",™

What pisses me off is when guys try to hit on me. Stupid guys. With no job. That are drunk. I've gotten into so many bar fights its not even funny. Thank Jesus no one called the cops. By the way...
