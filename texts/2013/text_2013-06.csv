The Allpoint® ATMS aren't ubiquitous but there are enough around so it's not a pain. (I live in San Francisco)  The only thing I haven't done yet is need to deposite cash.  That might be tricky.  I switched from BofA several years ago to ING Direct and I've loved them.  So far CapitalOne has not done anything to ruin that.  Actually I also have a linked ShareBuilder account and they dropped their transaction fee per trade since CapOne took over so, so far, so good.  I also like how they handle over drafts.  Instead of charging you a fee you apply for a line of credit that covers any potential overdrafts.

[Here](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-660M.71859.0.html) are a review and some benchmarks of the GTX 660m. You will that this card is a upper mid range one. Some scores and gaming benchmarks:  * 3DMark 11: 2544.9 points * Bioshock Infinite: 64 fps on high, 22 fps on ultra * Crysis 3: 26 fps on high, 11 fps on ultra * Battlefied 3: 42 fps on high, 19 fps on ultra  &gt; What about the screen?  With a glossy screen you can get reflections on your screen from your surroundings, especially from light sources which are infront of your laptop screen. For example it would be hard to see something on your screen in direct sunshine. As long as you are using the laptop indoors, it shouldn't be a problem.  &gt; Also, the wireless card seems to only mention N, will it be able to connect to other networks?

You will learn in time that working in Australia gives you a LOT of slushy snow and you will want to upgrade to goretex gear once money allows. Leather + goretex gloves, pants then jacket in that order most of the time.   Boot chains are sadly pointless down under. Don't get me wrong they are useful for 3 or 4 days of the season but you look like a tool if you use them. You will get shit for it from the season aires. Cons/whatever shoes are fine but if you get over them being wet, join the crowds and buy some [Sorels!](http://www.sorel.com/Men%27s-Caribou®-Wool-Boot/NM1481,default,pd.html) or similar cheaper verions. There is a reason the old timers wear them.  Driving up? Buy a fucking fan heater. If your accomm is like 99% of Aussie staff acccomm the heating will be shit or there won't be a good drying area. Either way bring up a $20 little fan heater. If only for drying your gloves and boots its worth it.   Ok because I'm lazy I'm just going to list other random things that come to mind.   * socks, lots of. 5 boarder socks 5 shit ass socks * 2-3 hoodies, you'll see that tall/big ass hoodies are what most wear to get your from bar to bar. Most people don't want to take their $300 jackets and leave em places where you will get them stolen/drunkly forgotten. Buy some sick big hoodies and rock them when it's not raining.  * sunnies, cause you look cool when riding on our famous 10 degree September days. * internet, some accomm has it, some don't. * laptop, derr * ambulance cover/private health insurance. I would not hire anyone without it. When you hurt yourself a trip to the hospital without ambulance cover is about $15,000 DO NOT MISS THIS. * depends on the people around you, but I used to share my kitchen with 12 people. It was so useful to have my own knife/fork/mug and bowl for when all the other fuckers have taken the shit to their rooms. Have your shit, wash and keep. * boardies, you never know when you'll break into the hotel pool * 4 months of toiletries. They costs 200% more on mountain. * if you've got less than 50 days riding: [Ass protection!](http://www.azzpadz.com/) or similar.  * neckwarmer/balaclava. Trust me on this one * washing powder is like gold, don't leave gold near washing machine.  * multi plug socket board! You will need this as there's never enough power points! Seriously * patience. You will get dick all hours when the snow sucks, and heaps when the snow is good. Ride it out and you will still be employed in September, this is the light at the end of the tunnel.

Generellt sett de som ser MAN/KVINNA som något negativt och talar om den i termer av hur den är förlegad brukar vara samma grupp som kämpar för att göra sig av med ondskefulla™ ""patriarkiska"" normer som den traditionella familjen.  &gt;Så länge personen är mentalt frisk och kan hantera att ta hand om barn.  Frågan är väl snarare om den personen kan uppfostra ett barn och ge det samma goda förutsättningar i samhället efteråt. Desto mer socialt avvikande en person är desto sämre chanser har de generellt sett framtidsmässigt.  &gt;Jag är en stor förespråkare för att vi måste erkänna att det finns stora biologiska skillnader mellan män och kvinnor.

Biologer får mer och mer kritik från samma pack som tycker att det är fel att en transsexuell med medel 50% effektivare övre kroppsmuskler och 30% nedre inte får slåss i MMA mot äkta kvinnor.   &gt;Jag vill se en ny omröstning om EU medlemskap till exempel, då jag är fullt övertygad om att en majoritet av den svenska befolkningen är emot EU idag.  Detsamma, men jag nämnde det mest för att du talade om hur ""förlegat"" det känns med traditionella familjesyner. Majoriteten av Svenskar lever själva enligt såna syner och jag tycker nog att dess motståndare borde ha lite självinsikt till just hur liten minoritet det handlar om som förespråkar emot det.  &gt;Du kan läsa mer om att ladda upp sitt medvetande till datorer/robotar här, vilket än så länge är hyptotetiskt:  Om något så stärker det bara påståendet. En otestad hypotes är inget mer än en gissning. Sen är biologiska datorer på stadiet av att max klara av väldigt enkel aritmetik, lagring och enkel logik så de ligger ungefär 60 år bakom vanliga datorer.   &gt;Kan väl tillägga att jag själv sett en skrämmande tendens i media att försöka smutskasta manligt/kvinnligt.   Ja, det är ett rätt så vidrigt sätt att hantera det men grundar sig i samma norm-motsättning utan den socialliberala komponenten som verkar vara grund för din ståndpunkt.",™

This is a common theme in the SGGS   * Marriage is considered sacred in two ways. First, it is highly recommended for us. Secondly, that word is also used to describe the relationship between God and humans: we are brides and God is the husband and the simran we do is like being in a marriage with God.     &gt; [Just a search for 'marriage' at srigranth.org](http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Search&amp;Param=english)   * Marriage is also a form of control on lust.    * I couldn't find information in the SGGS about having marriage as a requirement for sex.   What the SGGS suggested to me is that you need to control the lust. So the answer to your question:  &gt; Does this mean that Sikhism prohibits recreational sex?   Might be yes if you make it the focus of your life.    On the other hand, the rehat maryada is *very* clear on pre-martial sex. It is a no. Sikhs have differing views on the authority of the rehat maryada.    &gt; Does Guru Granth Sahib provide any instructions on sex?   Lol, I don't think so. The SGGS is not a hard rulebook governing all aspects of your life. It is a guide book to keep you focussed on God, to give your perspective that God is the important thing to keep in your mind.   &gt; Is premarital sex a taboo?   In punjab and punjabi culture, hella yes. ",▫

t5_2sidu,purplebearz,1370126616,"***Blazed and Confused.***    This story is about the time I befriended ms mary jane. Back in the day I rolled with a couple of kids, we will call them K and C. K is a girl, Cs a dude. Me? Well I'll be S. I'm also female.  I grew up in the burbs, sheltered throughout my early education by being funneled through the private school system until about Grade 6. Grade 6 is when I like to call that I, ""met the real world"", for little old innocent me. Weed ""Oh, my dad is always picking those in my front yard."" Pot ""The pots to the pans?"" Cum ""You mean come*?"".    Yeah.. embarrassing shit but we've all been there.   Anywho, the next couple years roll around and this is when I met my new posse! Oh fuck, shit's about to get real now! I was taught the ways of the corrupt juvenile's world. By now I had become increasingly interested in drugs and had dabbled in some readings you all are probably familiar with (*Go Ask Alice* , *Lucy In The Sky* , *Glass*). So my interest was peaked to say the least :). I didn't seek out the weed, the weed sought me. My first meet came and went, my second time passed, but the third, yall, the THIRD TIME was when I FINALLY was blessed with her presence.    K and I were chillen at her house on a Wednesday afternoon after school. Her parents were never home, so we never thought anything of it. These were the days of myspace. The haven for teeny boppers and kids with no lives alike. The leather office chair was our throne of puberty.    And we were accompanied by cheeze its. I took the steak knife laying conveniently in front of me and split the bag of delicious cheesy goodness upon. As I crammed a handful into my still baby fat present face K peaked into the doorway.   ""Uh, put that shit up. You'll want to save them for later. Meet me in the garage!""   I sighed, logged off, set the cheeze its down, and met her and C in the suburban home for cars.   I sat down and she introduced me to this thing. THIS FUCKING THING, called a ""Geeb"". ""What the hell is that?"" I asked in chaste curiosity. ""This, sweet S, is The Gravity Bong."" K went on to explain the ""physics"" of this contraption but her description was beyond my comprehension. ""Let's just smoke the damn thing, dude."" C grinned.   So that we did.   1 hit, 2 hit, 3 hit, anotherrr....   6 geebs later.    ""This is a piece of shit. I'm going back on myspace."" K laughed, ""Mk, S. You do that."" I walked back to the throne, logged back onto the myspace, and was browsing my way through the space when all of a sudden the background of a teeny bopper princess' myspace page began to swirl. 'o_O' I blinked a few times, chalking it up to a GIF. I began reading her 'About Me' when something came over me.. *what the fuck* I thought as I was overwhelmed with laughter and relief. I laughed for a good five minutes straight before K came in and asked what I was laughing at. 'o_O' She gave me the same look I had just given the computer screen when I couldn't explain my hysteria through my bellowing chuckles. I 'placed' my head on her computer desk, forgetting about that steak knife I had 'conveniently' left in less than arms reach earlier. ""WHAT THE FUCK"" I exclaimed when I mistook 'placing' for slamming. My face met the knife, but thankfully it was just a scratch and I threw it at the closet as I chuckled a bit more. Assumingly grateful it didn't do more damage, I suppose!   C joined K and I and we all began to talk. I just couldn't control myself and didn't try to hide this jit status  of mine either. I rolled around on the floor still giggling up a storm.  ""Yo I'm going to smoke a bit more if anyone wants to come with."" C said.  So we followed him back to the g-rage. After a couple more hits and the cheeze it box in tow I hugged C, letting him know how grateful I was for sharing the goods with me and giving me this experience. He pat my back and hugged me back. We all sat in stoned bliss as we contemplated on when we should draw the garage door to unleash the toke smoke.   K got up and did the deed, as me and C shared the cheeze its. K began packing the geeb up, and I munched away.   ""Woah did you hear that?"" C said.  ""Naw my chewing is too loud."" I slowly replied.  K dissapeared inside.   C and I got up and began walking back inside, and as I opened the garage door leading into the house a force on the opposite side pushed me back. I burst out laughing with the munchie sponsored cheeziness still in the confines of my mouth, spewing the debris EVERYWHERE.    K's mom grimaced at me as she wiped orange shit off her face. ""S... Go the fuck home.""   K laughed hysterically in the back. ""You shouldn't be laughing, K ___ ___(full name).""    I apologized profusely as I gathered my things and darted out the front door, C in tow. ""Fuck this, fuck this, fuck this I can not get in trouble! Can I come over?""   And C and I walked/ran to my humble abode in the neighboring suburban hood to embrace the remainder of our time with mary jane.    **☀** The End **☀**  ",☀

t5_2qm4e,Dannei,1370126863,"I've never heard of any swaps - with stellar systems, they are often so far apart that the chance of interaction is very small, and when it does occur, it tends to be quite catastrophic. The same applies to planets, actually. It's technically possible to do what you're asking, I believe, but it would be very hard to pull off without something colliding or being thrown out of the system entirely.  There are quite a few cases of planets having caught passing asteroids/comets as moons, though - both of Mars' moons fall into this category.  &gt;One extra question if anyone wants to answer, what would happen if two free-floating planet was in an orbit around themselves and one of them had a moon? Would the orbit slowly decay until they collided due to the slightly larger gravitational pull at a certain time in their orbit?  It would have to be a very large moon to have much effect - and once the gravitational attraction of the moon becomes important, you end up with three objects orbiting each other, rather than two planets and a moon. Once you get three objects, working out what happens becomes fun™ and depends entirely on the starting configuration.  To get a bit handwavey, for every time you get an ""extra"" pull (I presume you mean when the moon is closer to the second object), you get a period of ""less"" pull due to the moon being further away. This would just act to create a combined planet-moon system with a slightly higher average mass than the planet alone.",™

First off, SW's damage coefficient. Methodology here was very simple, walk up to MP10 Nightmare Ghom, hit sweeping wind, let it expire, record his health, repeat.  (Rather than trying to copy things over I'm just going to post screenshots from excel.)  http://i.imgur.com/aUgWEPN.png  As you can see, the results were almost perfectly in line with a 0.2 damage coefficient at 0 stacks, as the SW tooltip indicates. Replicating this for 3 stack isn't really possible but I think its safe to say that 0.2*3=0.6 is a fair assumption.  Next, applying skill damage bonuses to the base coefficient. Same methodology with a 10% SW Inna's Radiance along with 4 pc Inna's and a handful of other random gear for the sake of modulating stats to ensure consistency.  http://i.imgur.com/RF2zGkL.png  As suspected, the bonus applies multiplicity just as it does with FoT:TC.

t5_2qhqb,RichieSM,1370174683,"This sort of thing is easily bypassed.  There are countless examples that a simple Google search can provide, but here's something similar to what I do because I host my own email.  As an example for email:    - Set up a cheap VPS (e.g. http://www.cloudnext.co.uk/vps/), install Webmin if you're not that technical, to manage it via a web browser.  - Buy a personal domain name from someone like Fasthosts with the privacy features enabled  - Point the A and MX records for the domain to your VPS  - Set the reverse PTR record (ask Cloudnext to do this) to the same as your domain name, set the hostname on the server to the same: # echo 'YOURDOMAIN.COM' &gt; /etc/hostname &amp;&amp; hostname -b -F /etc/hostname  - Install your desired MTA. I usually go for Exim4 but Postfix is also very good. Configure it to only allow authenticated users to relay mail through the server. Install Dovecot for your POP3/IMAP server  - Only enable the SSL versions of POP3/IMAP  - Grab a free SSL cert from www.startssl.com and install it  For web traffic you could also proxy your connection through your new server:   - Install Squid  - Configure UFW to allow incoming Squid connections from only your home IP address  Want DNS too?   - Install BIND, set it to forward all requests to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Again, only allow requests from your home network because you might have just installed an open resolver if not, and that's a Bad Thing™.  ",™

t5_2qh1i,xxVb,1370181964,"Be like a dude among dudes, pretty good advice.  I'd add that it's easier to be friendly with guys, plural, than with just a guy. One on one chats tend to be more intimate, and the guy will constantly be wondering why you're talking to him - do you want to bone him, are you desperate for someone to talk to, do you like him, can't stand anyone else around, trying to pick his brain about something he knows well...? What's your ulterior motive, girl? Why else would you be talking to me?  If the dude culture among the guys is one of constant teasing and making fun of each other, join in. Just make sure you can joke about yourself just as much as about the others, and can take being the butt of jokes just as often as one of the guys. Guys are mean when they're friends. We laugh at each other as much as we laugh with each other.  (Most females I like the most, young or old, relative or not; are funny. They have a sense of humor and wield it well. Whether this is because they had guys around that taught them the guy™ sense of humor, or because they're just funny in their own way, humor is important in friendships. Actually: it's important, period.)  Talk about stuff. Not emotional stuff, we don't generally do that. If we're on the verge of killing ourselves, we might notice that we've been feeling a little down lately. We're generally not very smart when it comes to emotions, and while talking about feelings would probably help identify them, it's also a way to quickly share too much and become attached to the person you've shared them with. No matter how good a person you think you wanna be, don't catch that attachment. If a guy starts talking emotional stuff with you, he might actually use it to test the waters, whether you're a person interested in his emotional well-being or not - aka love or something like that. Tell him to man up instead of listening.  (Women, generally, stereotypically, talk about their problems because they need sympathy to deal with them. Men instead either seek solutions or just need to vent. This isn't to say it's exclusively male to vent or female to need sympathy, but guys generally value solutions over sympathy. Friend guy has problem? Suggest solution. It can be a bad solution too. He's processing, he needs input to weigh his options.)  Talk about stuff that the guys talk about. This can be anything from our tech toys (computers, cars, whatever) to just more general life stuff like how middle management are idiots (especially if one of the guys works in middle management, see above). If you're not sure, join in once the guys start talking, or just hang around and listen. Suddenly sociology, or climate politics, or game design, car trunk contents, CPR, IRS, IRA, trip to Canada, or the optimal height of stairs. It's not that guys don't talk, we just talk about interesting stuff instead of feelings. XD  Guys tend to like doing stuff together. They don't generally meet just to talk, they need an excuse and need something to do. They talk when they're gaming, when they're building something, when they drink, when they hike... they need something to do. Join their activities, and do stuff. Don't just sit around to be around them, do stuff.  This also relates to the compliments stuff yummy_yummy_red_wine brought up. Guys don't compliment each other on things they are or how they look; they compliment each other on achievements. Achievements are important to guys, even if they're small, and them being acknowledged is the kind of compliment we appreciate. I couldn't care less if my hair looks nice, but moving a computer is awesome. (stupid example tho)  It's all generalized, of course, but should still be useful.",™

t5_2qhwp,alendeus,1370198353,"The only link I found is transcripts on the Duke4 forums, but [here's the blog posts from the DNF art director after they laid off nearly everyone:](http://forums.duke4.net/topic/1091-the-wild-ride-t-ray-isaacs-story/)  &gt;The team was hitting on all cylinders at this point. Everyone knew what DNF was and how it was going to turn out. f-ing cool ass itsh. No doubt. The team leads, Brian, Pollard, Chris, Rick and Myself were all on the same page kicking out some serious content, design and tech in an insanely small amount of time. Along with Georges/Dukes' off the wall, no holds barred style of situational humor, DNF had the makings of something many people hoped and prayed for (sans the haters)...nothing short of ""bad-ass""™.   &gt;The last 6 months leading up to D-day where nothing less than awesome. I think everyone on the team had gotten to a point that any and everything that we created was dead on. We had created ""the perfect storm"". We had a team that knew the product/ip inside and out, we were nailing our goals and then some on a weekly basis, we had a plan for not only completion but for success, and we had a team with the talent, will, and drive to take this mutha-kcufr across the finish line. What more could you ask for?   &gt;The guys on the DNF team, a team 1/3 the size of the average game dev team, were pulling out all the stops. I can honestly say that everyone was in the zone at this point. Cat's would go home on the weekend and fix issues/improvements in their ""spare time"" and then come in on Monday and say things like, 'that animation issue you were asking about....I fixed it...yep' or, 'you know that feature we talk about maybe we'd get it in .... got it in on Sunday. I was like, damn man.. thanks a lot. These random acts of super-bad-ass-ness were like fuel for the fire. Guys would see/hear about others on the team doing stuff like that and it would inspire them to do something like that as well. I remember one of the programmers, in his spare time, got the code running on a (non-PC) platform. This team was seriously operating on another level. So, as you can see... the light at the end of the tunnel was brighter than ever.    Of course, this is a very passion filled post. But that's exactly what the Prey 2 guy is doing in the OP, he's venting steam because he wanted the game to get done, and was sure they had the formula down. What this unfortunately creates is the assumption that the publishers are the bad guys in this, and a martyr illusion where ""aww man the game would've been so much better had *we* been able to finish it ourselves"" that fans will hold on to, even though we have no clue what the game really was like or would've turned out that way. It happens every time a game/project gets canned. ",™

t5_2shyc,lojic,1370213977,"LTE is essentially super fast internet. It's the Real Deal©.   What T-Mobile calls 4g, on the other hand, is technically known as HSPA+. It's also really fast! Like, 10-25Mbps fast. However, it's also not as fast as LTE, which is why T-Mobile is rolling out LTE to the market.   LTE involves new towers/antennae/etc, and so it's a slow rollout. You said you live and commute around the outside of one of their new LTE zones--most likely, your phone is jumping from an LTE enabled tower to an HSPA+ tower.   There's no real downside for you, other than 4g being slightly slower than LTE. You can even rest easy knowing that HSPA+ is still faster than many people get on other network's LTE!",©

t5_2sa7c,TristanTheViking,1370222219,"I use Alienlayer. They have pretty cheap VPS hosting, especially the [specials](http://alienvps.com/vps-hosting-specials/). For $19/month, you get 3GB RAM, 50GB storage, 300Mbps connection, and 8 cores CPU. Edit: In player slots, this means many. 25 players with a couple of heavy plugins won't be a problem.  &gt;1. ✔  &gt;2.  ✔ With a host, you don't need to do any port stuff on your end. With a VPS, you might, but it isn't difficult, especially if you get it with CentOS or something. Opening a port is pretty much copy/pasting this command:     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport [port number (For a MC server, usually 25565)] -j ACCEPT   Not too tricky and there's lots of tutorials if you need them. &gt;3. ✔ (Depends a bit on your location, though)  &gt;4. ✔ You can either SSH in or use an FTP client like FileZilla. You may need to install a FTP program on the server first, though. Again, not difficult.  &gt;5. ✔ If you aren't hosting it yourself, it won't touch your internet.  If you aren't interested in a VPS, just check out [BestMinecraftHosts](http://www.bestminecrafthosts.com/) for reviews and ads by hosting companies.",✔

Same methodology as last time, but dual wielding this time with off hand being the active weapon.  http://i.imgur.com/qG8nHF0.png  As expected, no crazy FitL shenanigans take place when dual wielding.  So at this point I can confirm the full, accurate formula for SW is (w/o FitL): &gt;`((MH_AVG_DMG * MH_ACTIVE_PERCENT) + (OH_AVG_DAMAGE * OH_ACTIVE_PERCENT)) * (0.6*(1+SW_BONUS)) * (1 + (CHC * CHD)) * (1 + (DEX / 100)) * APS * BUFF_TOTAL`  \* demon bonuses, elite bonuses, etc   Full excel version w/o FitL (B56):  &gt;`=(((((((B8*IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,B6))+IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),0,(B19*B17)))*(0.6*(1+IF(('DPS Stats'!B11&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B11,0))))*(1+(A44*'DPS Stats'!B7)))*(1+('DPS Stats'!B2/100)))*A40)*A46)*((1+IF((Buffs!I7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B3,0))+IF((Buffs!J7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B4,0))`  and w/ FitL (B64):  &gt;`=(((((((B10*IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,B6))+IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),0,(B21*B17)))*(0.6*(1+IF(('DPS Stats'!B11&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B11,0))))*(1+(A44*'DPS Stats'!B7)))*(1+('DPS Stats'!B2/100)))*A40)*A46)*((1+IF((Buffs!I7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B3,0))+IF((Buffs!J7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B4,0))`  On to the implications: non-FitL SW damage falls and FitL SW damage rises for an overall drop in eDPS. More interestingly though, it devalues bonus SW damage (whereas Laxdk's results show increased value of competing bonus FoT damage); although I have my suspicions that correcting the cyclone damage formulas may balance this out, or even show a net gain in the value of bonus SW Damage.

You are such a wordsmith, you can beat yourself off all day long and not get tired. This very post is exactly the sort of high-caliber, friendly content that we all know Gunnit is only producing more and more of every passing day.  In fact, I found a video that summarizes all your lessons [right here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=og3COmVwvdA#t=38s).  I'm in love with the direction Gunnit is headed. My favorite guns are the AR-15 and the Glock 19 and the Remington 870.  If you get different guns, you wasted your money, since you can't learn the fundamentals on other guns. You have to become an expert with every gun you own, otherwise you're wasting your time and money, and endangering others. AKs are pieces of typical Russian shit. Russia can't do anything right, lol, America rules! I always shoot all my guns with my thumb over the bore, since it improves my ergo grip and sitrep reaction times. My first gun was a Ruger 10/22, which I took to Appleseed. Revolvers are stupid, I don't know why anybody has them anymore ha ! Obama is really not a bad guy and we just need to invite the leftists over to our house for tea so they'll see how nice we are. Then they'll buy guns themselves and we'll all live happily until the FBI arrests us for copyright infringement and domestic terrorism, or until PE finishes jerking himself off, whoever comes first.  What is your goal in making these posts ? To educate ? All you do is belittle and condescend and wax mournfully at your own genius. All your 'instruction' is backhanded to reinforce your self-styled pseudo-intellectual superiority over us, the 'people you've never heard of'. Retarded users on here look up to you 'for some reason' -- no wonder this sub has gone to shit. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The sub has drowned in meta minutiae bullshit, and the last time I saw this place come alive was when our rights were being seriously threatened. Since then the mods in typical asinine fashion silenced open political posts.  Seriously, /k/ is funnier and more instructional, yet is much less serious. The only reason I come to this PC pit anymore is for /r/gibs-muh-dat, a refreshing and clear oasis. Or maybe unless I have a specific question for you, /u/presidentender™.  Edit : I forgot to mock your little flair too. The rest of us little people will feel bad about our Mosins when we don't see a little pistol round and an insignia on our computer screen.",™

Freedom by Design uses the talents of architecture students to design solutions that will make the client’s life easier, for example a ramp for someone confined to a wheelchair.    With over 150 AIAS chapters, Freedom by Design™ (FBD) teaches students how to resolve accessibility issues while simultaneously providing them with the real world experience of working with a client, mentorship from an architect and constructor, and an understanding of the practical impact of architecture and design.

Relevant stats:  * 13-13 damage range * 1270 Dexterity * 10% Bonus Sweeping Wind damage  Expected damage of a non-critical cyclone tick:  &gt;`(13 * (1 + (1270 / 100))) * (0.26 * (1 + 0.1)) = 50.9366`  Actual damage: 51  Just as with FoT and SW, cyclone skill damage bonuses are applied multiplicatively.  These tests were also all done using identical dual wielded weapons and cyclone damage was consistent over both active hands, so any off-hand FitL weirdness is out here as well.  The last bit of the equation is of course: how many times do these silly things hit. Procing a single cyclone at a time and counting the number of hits would suggest 6. Some quick googling finds a few sources that also site 6 hits/cyclone. However, because it seems clear that the original intent of the 0.9 coefficient was to correspond to 4.5 hits/cyclone (0.2 * 4.5 = 0.9), combined with the fact that this would put the total coefficient so far off the current value (1.56 vs 0.9), that I don't feel entirely comfortable calling this one without some further testing (soon™).",™

t5_2qh1i,Uhhhhlisha,1370261009,"I agree with the obesity part. Whether its tax on BMI or just people needing to be held accountable for their healthcare. We used to have waiting periods and plan exclusions for pre-existing on health policies and now the waiting period for pre existing diseases are waived on almost every health policy. BUT, if we didn't do that, lets say, if you have been morbidly obese and you develop type 2 diabetes you will have to pay extra because it is a self inflicted disease. Same for other negative health habits like smoking, there should be higher premiums for the negative health effects developed from those, too.  I know it probably makes me sound like a complete bitch, and I'm not saying people need to be a size zero (because SOMETIMES that is equally unhealthy and it is unrealistic) but people need to be HEALTHY. America is starting to embrace the ""extra large"" person and I don't get it. It shortens their life expectancy, raises their health risks, and the habits and genetics are passed down to their kids.

t5_2qh16,p_giguere1,1370272163,"I see what you mean, but it doesn't really refresh. The page you see during the swipe back animation is not a rendered web page but rather a screenshot of your last visited page. You could not interact with it unless the ""refresh"" occured. The fact that it caches PNG screenshots of your history rather the rendered pages is by design. In other words, it's understandable that you don't like it, but it's not a bug, it's a feature.™  I'm not totally sure why it's done that way, but my guess is that loading a web page from cache (even if all assets are loaded already) isn't 100% instant since your CPU has to render text and vector graphics again, taking a fraction of second that's just long enough to make the swipe back animation not be fluid enough. A solution would have been to cache both the PNG screenshot and the actual web page, in order to temporarily display the screenshot until the cached actual web page had finished rendering, but that would have taken more RAM that what people are used to with other browsers. I think the option should still should have been there for those who don't mind ""wasting"" RAM in order to have an elegant solution with both the swipe-back feature and website caching.",™

Epub 2012 Feb 18.  **A randomized controlled pilot trial of oral N-acetylcysteine in children with autism.**  Hardan AY, Fung LK, Libove RA, Obukhanych TV, Nair S, Herzenberg LA, Frazier TW, Tirouvanziam R.  Source  Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.  hardanay@stanford.edu  Abstract BACKGROUND:  An imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory systems with abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. METHODS:  This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale.  RESULTS:  Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p &lt; .001; d = .96). CONCLUSIONS:  Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder. Large randomized controlled investigations are warranted.  Copyright © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

t5_2s3qj,hak8or,1370302314,"Huh, a response!  &gt;Additionally, the Cryptrade ASIC model is not “configurable” nor was this ever advertised. The FrostBit™ unit itself is configurable however to diversify unit capabilities, customers will be required to upgrade the unit for the designed task;  There are two ways that it is possible to reconfigure this unit to do these very different things, such as mining scrypt coins and 3d rendering and even file compression. One is either have an ASIC like I described and change the functionality on a software level, which is very doubtful, or the second option, have the user physically open the unit, de-attach the liquid nitrogen cooling system, take out the PCB (assuming asic's are soldered) or take the asic out of its socket, and put in the new asic which is capable of 3d rendering and whatnot. I stand by what I said earlier regarding that it is prohibitively expensive to have asic implementations of mining litecoins and 3d rendering and file compression all on the same die, so that would mean different asic's for different functionality, which further results in the unit being able to do only one thing at once (mining vs 3d rendering vs file compression). Unless of course they are using some sort of architecture similar to what GPU's have today, which is many small ""cores"" working in parallel.  Even if they were using the many small cores technique, you will still have a massive die, which is very expensive (die's are priced for the most part based on feature size and die size). Keep in mind that the current GPU implementations for rendering are from Nvidia and Ati, and those cards cost a good bit of money due to die size and engineering costs, which Crypteks has not shown any sign of getting around. Lets not forget that they are still using their superconducting asic material, which is a massive cost in of itself, and they are somehow using this new material at a 32nm feature size?!   &gt;(3) Cryoniks Inc. Cryonic ASIC+ processors are custom fabricated in the U.S taking full advantage of low-temperature superconducting 32nm technology  This seems very infeasible from everything I know about EE, and even though I am still just a student, I still firmly believe that based on my knowledge what you are saying is utter bull-honky. If you are honestly telling the truth, then you **need** to give more information to the general public, or this will be all just dismissed as a scam, since you have to admit, in all honesty, it shares so many features with a scam. It has the very well done and flashy presentation, the promise of a beautiful product capable of nearly everything you can imagine, little to no information on how your claims are actually true, as of now no 3rd party verifying you, as well as the albeit limited association of your previous kickstarter failure. Though, I do have to hand it to you, that box is very damn sexy, I would kill to have that as a square coffee table.  &gt;There are various assumptions made in the article that are also inappropriate; a liquid-purge for example would be considered common-sense as heat-sinks are not sealed and this process would prevent cryonic liquid nitrogen from damaging key electronic components. FrostBit™ units are not to be moved during operation.  Please point out other assumptions you feel are inappropriate or wrong, as it would present more information about this product to further prove or disprove your claims so anyone who might purchase it in the future will be better able to make a more informed decision. The removal of the liquid nitrogen by allowing it to evaporate is most certainly not common sense based on how little information was provided. If this was a closed loop, then the same laws of physics apply as moving a normal windows AC. You can move a windows AC while it is running, though admittingly putting it upside down is not a good idea due to the oil from the compressor no longer preforming its function that well (AC people feel free to chime in, I only know basic AC things from when I was considering a phase change system for cooling my old Q6600 when overclocking), as the nitrogen gas is stored within the loop at all times at a high pressure state. It makes no difference to the gaseous nitrogen what orientation it is. Now, if this is an open loop, with the cooling done by having the liquid nitrogen drip from a cooled tube as is done in laboratory environments to generate liquid nitrogen, then moving it while it is running will possibly cause the LN2 to spill and indeed damaging components not designed for low temperatures, and that makes total sense.   But then you reach a good bit of other issues. If this is an open loop, that means that the entire inside of the unit would need to be required to be filled with only nitrogen gas, which therefore means it is airtight, which means further that the only method heat will escape the unit is via conduction (the components inside are in contact with the metal case, which would then via radiation and convection release heat to the surrounding air), or via the condensers which would be outside the unit. This still does not solve the issue of throwing out over 2 Kw of heat to surrounding air, but lets leave that be. The open loop is done by cooling the surrounding nitrogen gas to such a low temperature that it liquefies and drips down into the pot which is above the ASIC. You are cooling 2 Kilowatts, a far cry from a processor which throws out at most 250 watts under extreme overclocking, and you claim to be doing that all with just around a few square feet of nitrogen gas, assuming that the nitrogen is stored at normal pressures. If not, you better be using some proper engineering for those walls of the unit, because then that is a seriously dangerous thing to do, keeping a high pressure vessel in your living space. After all, there is good reason why those cylindrical tanks used to store gases for welding are actually chained down.  Anyways, to get an idea of the volume of LN2 needed to cool a 250 Watt processor, here is a video of an old AMD overclocking record. Look at the two tanks they have sitting next to them to get a feel for the amount of liquid helium they are using. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKN4VMOenNM  There is no way on earth you can have so much volume of gaseous nitrogen to cool 2 thousand watts of heat in such a small unit, especially when you consider that nitrogen's expansion ratio is 700 times. This is assuming the nitrogen is kept inside the unit at low pressures. Higher pressures would, as I said earlier, be extremely dangerous to keep in your living area.  There is some more I would like to add to this but I already wrote a good bit to satisfy any questions regarding your two rebuttles, and I am still hoping someone who is more familiar with phase change, EE, semiconductor fabrication, or just simple physics would chime in and point some other things out which I surely missed.  One last thing which is very interesting is this: &gt;or if the seals on the unit were breeched. Opening the unit to modify or customize the inner components will void your warranty.  How are users supposed to upgrade their units later, especially if requires detaching the LN2 cooling system and physically swapping the asics, which I think we agree, is the heart of this machine. Also, lets say that you do send a unit to btcbible and it gets at least 1 Thash/s, indicating that you made due on your claims regarding performance. How will BTCbible verify your claims about the liquid nitrogen cooling, which you are advertising as a feature on your product? One way would be to measure any differences in the amount of nitrogen in the surrounding area, yes, but it still does not proove that you are actually cooling your asic's using LN2.  Also, lastly, what on earth is this suppoused to mean, and why is it hidden in fine print? &gt;(1) Beta FrostBit™ 1000 Cryonic Bitmining units are individually throttled up to 40% as per V1.00027B firmware release. Future firmware updates will gradually increase max GH/S rates to individual unit thresholds. See supplied User Manual for more information.  So it appears that the only limitation for higher hash rates is on the software end? Why does this limitation exist? Why not jump it to full performance considering that the user cannot modify the cooling later him/herself, showing that the original designs were intended to reach their advertised 100% performance? Unless of course this is some very shady advertising you have going on right there.",™

t5_2v5x9,Shallotosis,1370306245,"Since I'm pretty confident with the cyclone results I decided to go with something a bit less scientific (and I figured this would be a good way to wrap up and sanity test everything).  I edited formulas to incorporate all of my findings as well as Laxdk's and ran through my regular gear with 0 buffs.  Expected non-FitL damage:  835,702.90  Small aside that I found somewhat amusing, running the same numbers through a completely unedited version of the toolbox I got an expected non-FitL damage of 838,003.61, not even a 3k difference.  But getting back on track, Inferno MP10 Ghom, no buffs for me to screw up refreshing, no combo strike, no FitL:  http://i.imgur.com/zseiz7m.png  Pretty damn close (and closer to the edited formulas).  Formula used for non-FitL Cyclone (B57):  &gt;`=(((((((B8*IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,B6))+IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,(B19*B17)))*((0.26*(1+IF(('DPS Stats'!B9&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B9,0)+IF(('DPS Stats'!B11&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B11,0)))))*(1+(A44*'DPS Stats'!B7)))*(1+('DPS Stats'!B2/100)))*A46)*((1+IF((Buffs!I7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B3,0))+IF((Buffs!J7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B4,0)))*6`  Formula for FitL Cyclone (B65):  &gt;`=(((((((B10*IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,B6))+IF(('DPS Stats'!B26=0),1,(B21*B17)))*((0.26*(1+IF(('DPS Stats'!B9&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B9,0)+IF(('DPS Stats'!B11&gt;0),'DPS Stats'!B11,0)))))*(1+(A44*'DPS Stats'!B7)))*(1+('DPS Stats'!B2/100)))*A46)*((1+IF((Buffs!I7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B3,0))+IF((Buffs!J7=""y""),'DPS Stats'!B4,0)))*6`  I used the single hit coefficient and pulled the 6 hits/cyclone to the end as I think it makes the logic a lot more clear.  While I think that with this we can close the book on the non-FitL formulas there's something in the FitL buffed FoT formula that seems off to me. Specifically, the logic used to compute to weapon damage contribution is so vastly different from that used for FitL + SW and FitL + Cyclone. I think what its trying to accomplish is to account for FitL's bonus damage snapshotting the currently active hand when it is used, but clearly both versions can't be correct. So, still more to come (soon™).",™

t5_2ranw,SRSLovesGawker,1370307379,"Men can put up with a lot of crap. A lot of physical, mental and emotional hardship. We tolerate a lot of nonsense, we provide our blood, sweat and tears and sometimes even our lives to protect and provide for those we care about.  We require very little in return, but those things we require are absolute.  Those things are *respect*, *consideration* and *appreciation*.  In this man's case, despite being a considerate and dutiful quasi-dad/quasi-husband, the people he cared for showed him in no uncertain terms that they *do not respect him*, that they have *no consideration for him*, and absolutely *do not appreciate his sacrifices and contributions*.  After 10 years, if none of those are present, then leaving and not looking back is by far and away the most healthy thing for him to do. A clean break, a lesson dearly learned, but hopefully the promise of a life with someone who actually gives a crap ahead of him.  ... and as for those self-absorbed, grasping parasites he leaves behind, *fuck them.* He's not abandoning anyone, let alone ""his kid"" whom it has become abundantly clear is *not his* in any sense aside from a now past-tense financial obligation.  Now you'll have to excuse me. The idea of an SRS/CB clown having any sort of moral authority to declare what defines a *Real Father™* has made me laugh so hard my sides are aching.

The host country might start denying visas to Americans or start heavily scrutinizing their actions and turning people away at the border.

Heat oven to 375°F. Spray 12 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray. (i used cupcake liners, dont recommend as the pies stuck to the liners)  2. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in oil 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in center. Add onion and chicken broth; heat to simmering. Add frozen vegetables and seasonings. Heat until hot, stirring occasionally until almost all liquid is absorbed. Cool 5 minutes; stir in cheese. (I cooked the chicken then through in the remaining ingrediants and waited til the veggies were cooked. Mine was more liquidy bc of the  soup/milk but I had enough left over filling to freeze for next time)  3. In medium bowl, stir baking mixture ingredients with whisk or fork until blended.

t5_2t1w0,Druidika,1370364772,"A lot of work continues to be focused on our major launch features. If you haven’t already checked it out, head on over to the [UI 2.0 Command Chair](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/117053-ui-20/page__view__findpost__p__2333676) post and check out the latest information on our major overhaul of the Front End UI. Production is well under way on this new UI and we expect to begin testing in August. The final bits of engineering work are being put into 12 v12, which include further networking code optimizations, UI work, art optimizations, and some minor gameplay/level adjustments. Our drive to launch continues to keep the bulk of our team focused on delivering an exciting MechWarrior experience for all players.  **New Content:**  * `Mech of the Month - Quickdraw (18th) * Hero `Mech of the Month - FireBrand (4th) * Champion `Mech of the Month - Hunchback-4P© (18th) * New Pattern(s) - Sherman (4th) * New Cockpit Item(s) - Spider Statue (18th) * Special - Sarah's `Mech (25th)  **Test Servers**  The networking and hardware wizards are hard at work setting up this our new public testing environment. While not necessarily a new feature per se, this new server architecture will allow us to test a range of features from small tuning adjustments to large additions such as 12 v 12 and UI 2.0. This is part of our continued commitment to product quality and stability, along with involving the community in key aspects of the game’s development. The test servers will be coming online in June, and the first major test will feature 12 v 12 functionality.  **Company and Lance Improvements**  Further lance improvements make their way into the game this month. These adjustments are based of internal testing and player feedback. These new adjustments include text and audio queues when new orders are issued, Company and Lance Commander icons to identify leadership, revised chat color, and revised order icons for more clarity. If you haven’t tried out your leadership skills yet, have a go! Players can take command by pushing “B” for BattleGrid and taking either a Lance Command (4 players) or a Company Command (8 players).  **Balancing and Tuning**  LRMs, SRMs, and Flamers will receive tuning passes in the first patch of this month. For mid-June expect to see more tweaks to the UAV consumable, and Seismic Sensors. Jump Jets will receive a weight based shake to add a more realistic feel and help to balance out some of the jump sniping meta game. Caustic Valley gets a lighting adjustment for the mid-June patch Expect to see more details about upcoming adjustments in the Command Chair section.  **Host State Rewind (HSR) – Missiles**  With this latest addition, all weapon systems are now affected by HSR. HSR helps high ping players achieve more reliable hits, improving the gameplay experience and making them more competitive.  **Bugs and Stability**  A lot of effort has gone into improving and fixing some of the more difficult technical issues, among them the HUD bug (last month). This month we are introducing fixes for some to the more frequent black screen and disconnect issues some players may experience.  **Looking Forward**  * 12 v 12 is due out for first patch in July. * Training Grounds (tutorial) will make it's way live mi-July to early August. * Third Person view will be pushed to test servers in the next 30-60 days.",©

t5_2rfxx,freet0,1370389634,"OK I know this is one of those ""we ♥ RIOT"" threads, but I'll attempt to explain what most people's problem with RIOT's f2p system is.   First you need to understand that owning more champions and runes DOES give you an advantage in the game. You can counter your lane opponent and enemy team's composition better with more runes and more champions. Also more champions lets you trade with more people, letting your team get more out of hero selection in draft/ranked.  The main counter argument I've seen to this is you don't need all champions and runes. For example why own shaco? He's almost never played and is considered to be a low tier champion. I think this line of reasoning is absurd because 1) champions fluctuate in strength and popularity and 2) even ignoring 'low tier' champions, there are still a ton of good champions to unlock.  So, owning more champions and runes gives you an advantage. Now the main thing I hear people use to justify this is that its possible to own all the champions and all the runes without spending any money at all. What I don't think these people really get though is how many games this would take. I don't remember the actual number, but to unlock every champion is around 400,000 IP. If you get 100 IP per game(which is definitely higher than average) that's still 4,000 games, a number most people are unlikely to ever reach.   I will allow that you don't need to own every champion to be successful, in fact there are successful players who only play one (like BestRivenNA). However it still gives you an advantage, and I personally think that's unfair. Its a very small advantage when both players own a lot of champions (say 60 vs 80), but it actually makes a significant difference in say the 20 vs 40 range. This is especially pronounced for players just reaching 30 and I think does come across as greedy. They feel like they get an incomplete game unless they either play way more than is practical or spend money. Not to mention even if they do play enough to unlock everything, they're still at a disadvantage before they finish and after they're done they have an unfair advantage over others.",♥

t5_2qkt4,Fairlight_Ex,1370408611,"The picture that you linked indicates you'd be a great fit for Judo, as well as BJJ (Brazilian Ju-jitsu) or JJJ (Japanese jujitsu).  Judo plays to your strengths as a big guy with shorter arms, since arm length will not be as much of an issue as with other styles; you start your matches by grabbing the other guy (clinch). Learning to use your weight to your advantage and stay on your feet helps develop balance, muscle, and control, not to mention strengthening your legs tremendously.  BJJ is also good one for your body type. Stocky guys are really hard to deal with if they have a solid BJJ foundation, and it's harder to trap their limbs if they have short arms and know how to keep them in tight to their body. You'll develop monster core muscles as well.  You should also consider JJJ, although this one is a mixed bag since there are literally hundreds of different styles within JJJ and they can be very different from each other. I have personally trained in two of them, one of which is utterly useless in a real fight/street fight, but the other one is brutally effective and basically the science of how to kill people as fast as possible. If you are looking for actual self-defense skills to protect your self, family, and daughters, then JJJ is hard to beat and turns you into a death machine (depending on which teacher you have and what style you're looking at). Again, the first form of JJJ I studied was complete pansy nonsense, so be careful about this one. Watch some classes and make sure there is resistance training and not just fancy dance moves.  Regardless which style you go for, make a list of questions to bug your teacher/sensei/sifu/saboom/instructor about and make sure you're training under someone who is an effective communicator and teacher. If he is a 9th degree Black Belt in Death-Jitsu™ and can single handedly walk into a bar and wipe the floor with the faces of literally everyone there, but is very impatient and not a good communicator or teacher, then don't train with him. You'll learn very slowly from his poor teaching methods, he'll get frustrated, you'll get frustrated, and you'll likely give up.  If you want to see how good a teacher really is, find out if they have a children's class and go watch one. This is where you can clearly see how well he does at expressing concepts to newer students, not to mention see how well disciplined the classes are.  Good questions to ask your potential teachers:  * What are the core philosophies of your style? * What goals do you set for your students? * How long have you been teaching? * Do you consider your style to be more artistic or more practical? Or both? And why? * How do you determine when a student is ready to advance to the next rank? (so you don't get stuck with a ""pay-for-your-belt"" school, or schools that just give you your next belt every six months regardless of progress) * Do you offer realism training?   Hope some of this helps you out and good luck with your search.  Oh, I forgot. Make sure you can bring your own gear instead of being forced to buy from them. Some schools will have their own sparring gear that you have to use and price gouge you for it. Don't pay $150 for a pair of gloves, shin guards, and mouthguard. You can get all that for $80 or less. The exception is uniforms for Judo and ju-jitsu. Whether Brazilian or Japanese (or Judo), get a HIGH QUALITY uniform that won't tear or rip. You will be thrown around a lot and grabbing at clothes, so the clothes need to be thick and sturdy. We had a karate student come into our dojo and insist on using his own uniform, and the collar had torn off within a month because of all the clinch work we do. ",™

t5_2qkt4,Fairlight_Ex,1370411663,"Since I was poking fun at your typo, I suppose I owe you some advice. I don't live in NY, so take this all as general advice regardless of location:  * It doesn't matter how tough the teacher is if he can't teach. Being a 9th Degree Black Belt in Death-Jitsu™ and being able to walk into a bar and beat up everyone there means nothing if he is not able to effectively communicate the principles to you and help you grow as a student. Make sure he has patience and understanding; these are critical skills for any teacher, not just martial artists.  * MMA is not a style. Mixed Martial Arts simply means learning multiple martial arts rolled into one. An MMA gym usually has teachers that are proficient in Western Boxing, Brazilian Jujitsu, Kickboxing, and some Karate/TKD guys around. MMA gyms are great for getting the complete package, where you can learn a lot of different techniques from different coaches, and where you can usually find a sparring partner. The downside is that since you are studying multiple styles all at once, you are likely not going to become an expert at any one style. You can, however, become a very well rounded fighter.  * Since your goals are varied (a little self defense, a little sparring, a little confidence) choose a varied style, not something very specific. Karate is very specifically about punching and kicking. BJJ is very specifically about ground fighting and wrestling. Tae Kwon Do is very specifically about putting your foot through someone's face. Instead try to find something that encompasses a wide variety of techniques, such as Wing Chun (GOOD Wing Chun, not the crazy hippie crap!) Ju-jutsu (Japanese style) Muay Thai (good all around stand up game). Krav Maga is a good one too, although the Krav Maga that I was exposed to really favored big strong dudes who could just muscle their way through everything instead of teaching effective technique. Or, as in my previous point, you can seek out an MMA gym and get a blend of all of the above.  * Regardless of which style you choose, watch some classes and make sure they are balanced. Styles that do not spar at all are usually bullshido. Styles that are ""too dangerous to teach you the upper level techniques"" are usually bullshido. Joe Rogan, love him or hate him, had a very good point when he talked about how Wing Chun is notorious for practicing movements but never actually sparring. If you do Wing Chun, make sure they aren't afraid to slap each other around a little bit or put on some gloves and have at it. On the other hand, styles that spend 95% of their time sparring are usually just fight clubs disguised as a gym and you'll end up getting pulverized. Don't train somewhere that solely focuses on competition or winning points or whatever. Look for something in between, with a good mix between teaching effective technique and giving you some good sparring time. Too much of either one and not enough of the other will hamper your growth as a fighter.  * Are you intrigued with Asian culture and traditional martial art styles? Or would you rather just learn how to pulverize people? Keep that distinction in mind when choosing where to train. I've done boxing and BJJ in the past at an MMA gym, where we pretty much showed up as we pleased and trained with whoever was around. I have also trained in an authentic dojo, where you must bow upon entering, bow to your senior students, never interrupt a training session, never turn your back to a senior student, never sit on the floor with your leg pointed outward, never rest your hands behind your back, and always raise your right hand slightly as you pass another student. Also, the instructor yelled out commands in Japanese. Be aware of what you are committing to and don't sign up in an environment that will annoy you. I found the Asian culture to be a lot of fun, but people who aren't into that will get overwhelmed by all the rules.  * Check their grading methods. In other words, you should not automatically get a belt promotion every 3-6 months. Nor should you be held down to white belt rank if you have clearly grasped all the basic techniques within 2 weeks, but they want you to wait 2 months or whatever. Advancement should be based on your progress as an individual, not based on how long you've been there. I personally shot straight through my jujitsu white belt and blue belt within 2 and a half months, because I found it to be very easy. I even passed by several students who had been there much longer than me and outranked them very quickly. Then, I got stuck at green belt for OVER A YEAR. The techniques at that level suddenly required a degree of balance and sensitivity that I struggled with. Being pushed through green too quickly would cause my technique to suffer; being stuck at white belt for too long would have caused me to become very bored.  Hopefully these guidelines can help you narrow down your choices.",™

So when I thought you didn't understand me, I asked if I was unclear, with the implication that I'd explain. When you thought I didn't understand you, you insulted me and did not explain further.  Hm.  That said, ""kiss me"" is, implicitly, being used by the woman. But the first line says nothing about whether it's the dude or the woman who started the friendzone conversation. He could've started the conversation, and she asked for the kiss. Or she started it, and asked for the kiss. Your OP seemed to imply that it was the guy who started the conversation, and you did not dispute my implication that you thought it was the guy who started the debate.  &gt;In saying that, I just had a look at your comment history - looks like you enjoy starting arguments.   That's called an ad hominem.  &gt;So instead of wasting my time and yours, enjoy this clip[1] . It will serve your time better than talking to me, and it is right up your ally.

t5_2sf6m,mptyspacez,1370439070,"Crit nodes: if you don't specify a type, they go for everything    Unwavering stance stops you from being stunned (with many mobs around you, you pretty much get locked out of a fight), In order to bypass the loss of evasion, they take iron reflexes, which turns evasion into armor    Not aware of any diminishing returns for evade/block, definitely not for block at least.    Damage reduction from armor is based on the amount of damage that is dealt, and the armor you have, the higher the hit, the less effect armor has. This means you always need a healthy buffer (life or ES) alongside armor for hard hitting monsters.    Endurance charges are awesome, you can generate them with enduring cry, and since every time you gain a new one, you refresh the total duration, you can keep them up at all times, given enough mobs to go around.    Mobs crit, often.    Good gear is hard to come by, if you have to worry about accuracy, you get an extra requirement on all your gear pieces, to make it less so, you pick up resolute technique, especially if you don't spec for crits anyway.    Block recovery reduces the minor stun.    About elemental/phys damage. Currently physical damage was a bit underpowered compared to elemental damage, this is about to change however in the next update (coming soon™). You always want to get as much total damage as you possibly can, if this means mixing in elemental damage, that is no issue at all.  One thing to keep in mind though, is that mobs have armor too, if you have a low damage physical attack, it does significantly less damage in comparison to a hard hitting physical attack. ",™

His roll is brought 10 closer to the goal, placing his final check result at 42, which is within the range of success.  Way too cumbersome to use.  Not trying to be mean, but that's a clunky mechanic.  Look at the steps taken:  (1) DM sets the difficulty (r10).  (2) The DM rolls the dice.  (3) The DM adjusts the target number based on the difficulty.  (4) The player rolls his dice.  (5) The player *subtracts* his skill bonus from his dice roll.  Six steps is two steps too many.  And subtraction counts for extra, so it's more like three.  Compare that to the relatively simple d20 process.  (1) DM sets the difficulty.  (2) Player rolls 1d20.  (3) Player adds modifiers.",®

t5_2qhk3,waffebunny,1370453567,"Truly. I recall once an English teacher that had attempted to raise her own son tabula rasa; much to her consternation, he abandoned his gender-free lifestyle circa age five.  Personally, I believe it to be possible to raise a child with interests in both traditionally male and female pursuits; indeed, my daughter is living proof of this. (There are two containers of Lego pieces in her bedroom shooting out their evil Patriarchy Rays™ as I type.)  Where Feminist-style thinking goes wrong, I fear, is in attempting to inculcate in young girls an interest in traditionally male pastimes while ignoring or even demonizing the underlying principles that make such pastimes desirable. Such positive benefits as confidence, assertiveness and self-reliance are the results of boys routinely endangering themselves and competing (and frequently, conflicting) with one another. Handing a young girl a toy truck demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of this principle.",™
t5_2rz8w,xoxLove,1370453695,"Also..   The term “organic” refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. Specific requirements must be met and maintained in order for products to be labeled as ""organic"".   Organic crops must be grown in safe soil, have no modifications, and must remain separate from conventional products. Farmers are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes (GMOs), petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers.    What are Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)   Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are plants or animals whose DNA has been altered. These products have undergone only short-term testing to determine their effects on humans and the environment.   In most countries, organic products do not contain GMOs.   Organic livestock must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed. They may not be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal-by-products.   Is organic food more nutritious than non-organic food?  The evidence is unclear. Some studies suggest that, on average, organically grown fruits and vegetables may contain slightly higher levels of vitamin C, trace minerals, and antioxidant phytonutrients than conventionally grown produce. However, other studies have found no nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods.   The benefits of organic food  Organic foods provide a variety of benefits. Some studies show that organic foods have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally grown counterparts. In addition, people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives often find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods. In addition:  ◾Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Pesticides are chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. These chemicals are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.    Why do pesticides matter?  ◾Children and fetuses are most vulnerable to pesticide exposure due to their less-developed immune systems and because their bodies and brains are still developing. Exposure at an early age can cause developmental delays, behavioral disorders, and motor dysfunction.  ◾Pregnant women are more vulnerable due to the added stress pesticides put on their already taxed organs. Plus pesticides can be passed from mother to child in the womb, as well as through breast milk. Some exposures can cause delayed effects on the nervous system, even years after the initial exposure.  ◾ Most of us have an accumulated build-up of pesticide exposure in our bodies due to numerous years of exposure. This chemical ""body burden"" as it is medically known could lead to health issues such as headaches, birth defects, and added strain on weakened immune systems.  ◾Organic food is often fresher. Fresh food tastes better. Organic food is usually fresher when eaten because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is often (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms near where it is sold.  ◾Organic farming is better for the environment. Organic farming practices reduce pollution (air, water, soil), conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. In addition, organic farming is better for birds and small animals as chemical pesticides can make it harder for creatures to reproduce and can even kill them. Farming without pesticides is also better for the people who harvest our food.  ◾Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. The use of antibiotics in conventional meat production helps create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. This means that when someone gets sick from these strains they will be less responsive to antibiotic treatment. Not feeding animal byproducts to other animals reduces the risk of mad cow disease (BSE). In addition, the animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, both of which help to keep the animals healthy. The more crowded the conditions, the more likely an animal is to get sick. ",◾

If you are powering two AlienBees™ B800 flash units at full power (640 wattseconds) or one Einstein™ E640 flash unit at full power (also 640 wattseconds), you can expect between 400 and 500 flashes per battery charge.    Edit:  I rarely shoot at full power, even in daylight.  Recycle times are still very quick, however it does slow down if you have 2 or 3 strobes plugged into the same Vegabond mini.  With just one strobe connected though, it easily lasts me through a full day of shooting and I always seem to have at least 50% charge left.  I've been pretty well amazed by this battery pack.  The Einstein uses a bit more continous power than the Bees do, probably due to the LCD screen on the back and the digital controls but I don't know if it's enough to make a serious difference in the total # of pops you get at similar power levels.",™

All you have to do is push the little plus button next to the self post, then push the little camera plus to see your memes. Cuts down on karma whoring and reposts that get highly upvoted. Somebody point me to the negative. EDIT for this one: Memes not as highly upvoted means other content such as news, information, and debate rise to the top.  2. Busts blogspammers. There is absolutely zero negative to this.   3. Refocusing the subreddit on things that actually have to do with atheism. Yes, the gays are persecuted in parallel, but only in the places where their persecution is explicitly religiously related should the intersection of their plight with our subreddit occur.  4. Discourages trolls, encourages serious discussion. Again, this seems like a positive.  As long as this moderation is done with a light hand, as opposed heavy handed or skeen™ ""none at all"", I doubt you'll see much difference, and the subreddit will continue to thrive and grow.   If any of you took off your Fox News style blinders, you would see that this subreddit has been mocked across the board by reddit.

Even though, much to my distaste, I get called a newfriend, I feel I've been around long enough to establish some trust with the city, and nation, as a whole.  I studied politics in school, I love debating and I always try to go for the objective point of view - Playing the devils advocate is fun! Naturally, I have visions for where I want to take Suilven and Petrania as a whole. I'd love to get us more on the map, so to speak - Get us more out there! Cetracey and others have already done a wonderful job of getting us diplomatic ties and I'd like to further those ties. Also, I'd like to tighten our laws about newfriends joining. The process simply needs to be more controlled, so we avoid more SnakeHandler incidents. That being said, a lot of wonderful people wouldn't be here, if we didn't allow new people to join. (including myself.) It simply needs to be touched upon.  Another thing is - I think the Council needs the voice of the newer citizens. This whole 'Dictatorship' thing that's going around (which to me, is quite ridiculous.) wouldn't be a factor, if we had someone newer to the game inside the Council. I'm one of the oldest of the new - Why not Nebex?!   Have you enjoyed potatoes this past week? There's a good chance they were farmed at one of Hovel Industries farms! I'm by no means the founder of this wonderful little thing, all credit goes to Humatim, but I am his right-hand man, and I've helped built the old farms as the bottom of the mountain, and also the Giantfarm™.  I also got us on the frontpage with my newfriend-friendly attitude (which, honestly, was quite unintended.) I simply love being around town and having a laugh with people who comes by, citizens or not.   Most people in Suilven know my by know - If you like what you're seeing, vote for me!

t5_2sxwp,johnsmcjohn,1370530546,"&gt; How/when did you get into yo-yoing (is that the proper term)?  I started in November of 1997. I saw an episode of ""Guinness World Records"" on Fox and they had Chris Ciosek face off against ""Fast"" Eddy MacDonald for ""most tricks in one minute."" Chris was an unknown at the time, but he prevailed. At that moment, I said to myself ""I want to do that!"" And some 16 years later, here I am.   &gt; What's your favourite trick? How about top three/five ""crowd pleasers""?  Personally, my favorite trick involves using inertia to go from one mount to another(if you want a video, I'll be glad to try but my phone is a Samsun Potato® so be warned.) The top ""crowd pleasers"" are walk the dog(I don't like doing this one because it damages my(very expensive) yo-yo), rock the baby, and a trick where the yo-yo isn't tied to my hand, and I make the yo-yo and the counterweight I use spin in opposite directions. If you're patient, I'm going to try and upload both to youtube, but my internet sucks and the video won't be HD. But you'll get the point.   &gt; Do you do routines to music? What are championship competitions like (techniques vs. creativity, etc)?  Yes. This is called ""freestyle"" and it's the way most contests are won. Perform to 3 minutes of music of your choosing, and earn points on the tricks you hit as well as difficulty and showmanship. And a championship contest in insane. Imagine hundreds of people who've been practicing several hours everyday all at the same venue. It's great. :)  &gt; What do you like to do in your downtime when you're not yo-yoing?  Reddit and work primarily. Unfortunately, I'm 32 so I can't put as much time in as I'd like to.   &gt; What is your favorite band/music genre?  Band: Tool. Music genre: EDM. There's just so much amazing music to use for performances.   Thanks for a great question! :)",®

t5_2qh9a,_________lol________,1370533259,"I don't claim the market or a voluntary society is the The One Truth, I just think that it generally is better at solving problems that government-based solutions due to better-placed incentives. I also think that many of the problems we see today (Shell's polluting, etc.) are partially due to the government actions of the past (Corporate Personhood, EPA, etc.).  If you see Shell as problem, you can attempt to use the government to stop it, but then the problem is that Shell has more money than you and they have an incentive to control the government too. The more power you give to the government, the more incentive Shell has to control it, and the harder it is for individual voters to keep the power in their control.  Since we've tried the approach of Always Add More Government™ whenever a problem like Shell crops up, and such problems *keep* cropping up and/or generating new unintended consequences, I'd like society to take a stab at Lets Try Less Government For Once™.

t5_2r2jt,MsAnthropic,1370538745,"I readily admit that I don’t know all the details of your situation, but it sounds like you took risks, got burnt, and are surprised about it.  The first risk was dating within a very small friend circle.  Some people can handle it, but IME the vast majority of people can't.  You already knew that your ex was avoiding you, which was a sign that he wasn't comfortable being friends.  Then you started flirting with his friends pretty soon after you broke up, which is IMO isn't exactly kosher.   Lesson: don't fish off the company pier, as it were.  The second risk was not making friends of your own.  IME, people tend to side with the person that they were friends with first out of loyalty.   Lesson: always maintain an independent circle of friends.  The third risk was making out with someone you friendzone(d).  Usually that's Bad News™ because the Friendzoned will probably get upset afterwards; I don't blame them because IMO it's pretty much leading them on unless there is an explicit FWB agreement.   Did you think about why Friendzoned Guy told you all the hurtful things that were said about you?  It was probably done to hurt you or to curry favor.   Lesson: don't do relationship type things with people you have friendzoned unless you want to retract that friendzone.  If I'm making the wrong assumptions about your situation, I apologize.",™

But the basics of Burly Bill's Beer Chili™ are:  * 1 pound each of ground beef and ground/cubed pork  * 15-16oz each of black beans and dark red kidney beans - drained  * 1 can of crushed tomato  * 1 can of diced tomato - drained  * 1 bottle of [insert stout here]  * beef broth to taste  * 1-2 each of serrano, poblano, ancho, anaheim, habanero, jalapeno, mulato, chipotle, and pimiento peppers (a hot variety if possible) - diced  * 1 oz unsweetened dark chocolate - doesn't matter how you cut it, I guess, since it melts in the pot &lt;_&lt;  * 1/2 cup celery, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup leeks, 1 shallot and 1 yellow onion - diced  * 1 clove garlic - minced  * 8-10 oz maize (optional)  * salt, black/pink/white pepper, ground cayenne, Mexican oregano, parsley, and cilantro to taste  * 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp dried orange peel  In a large heavy skillet, brown the beef and pork. Remove the meat, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the vegetables and fresh peppers (leaving the smoked ones alone for now) to the pan to saute over medium heat until the onions are clear and the veggies are soft. (Add the garlic, veggies, and shallot about 1-2 minutes after the onion.) Season the vegetable-and-pepper mix while the garlic and shallot soften. Meanwhile, empty the beans, tomatoes, beer, and (if applicable) corn into a large stockpot or dutch oven on medium-low heat. Add the chocolate, broth, smoked peppers, and meat when the meat is done. When the vegetables are ready, add them directly to the rest of the mix. Continue to season to taste as the concoction simmers over low heat. When satisfied, let the mixture cook uncovered over low heat for however long you feel like letting it -- ideally for at least a couple hours. Serve in bowls with cheese, if that suits you, or put it in the fridge or freezer to serve later. Just please don't put it on a hot dog.",™

t5_2r9po,souldonkey,1370546575,"&gt; I can use the software that I want  +  &gt;It's a real shame that I won't be able to use this wonderful piece of software  Erm....wat?  The reason you need to upgrade is because the OS you're using is outdated. It will be end of support (meaning basically dead) in April. By your logic there's no reason anyone should ever upgrade. Why don't I still use windows 98, or 2000? Because they're old and a better, faster, more robust OS has replaced them.  &gt;there's still software being developed for XP and still tons of people using it  No there's not. Software is being developed for Windows 8 and windows 7 and they are making it ""compatible"" with Windows XP. That is not the same thing.  &gt;I mean, if people are still using XP for 10+ years, then they must have done something right with that OS right?  My dad still listens to vinyl records and 8-tracks. That does not mean that they are better than digital media or cds. This argument is bad and you should feel bad.  &gt;until they specifically start forcing me to upgrade due to games / software not being compatible with XP, then I don't see the need for upgrading it.  Why? I can see not upgrading immediately, but come on. Waiting until the shit you use literally will no longer function? As I said before, I could install windows 2000 on a PC right now and it would still do the stuff that many people do everyday, but that does not mean I should.  Windows 8 may be a big leap and, as it's still very new, wouldn't be necessary. But you should at least get 7. It's faster, more reliable, has better features, and you'll probably see a performance increase in pretty much everything you do on it. As a comparison, a fresh install of Windows XP takes about 40 minutes, and then you have to install anywhere from 6-15 drivers or more. A fresh install of 7 takes about 8-10 minutes, maybe 15-20 on a *really* slow machine. I've done *a lot* of Win7 installs and I have never once had more than 3 drivers to install.   Do what you want, but your stubbornness is really only hurting yourself.     Also, that whole ""until the software is incompatible"" thing may be closer than you [think](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/tech-specs.html):  &gt;System requirements Windows  &gt;Intel® Pentium® 4 or AMD Athlon® 64 processor (2GHz or faster)  &gt;**Microsoft® Windows® 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8**  &gt;1GB of RAM  &gt;2.5GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)  &gt;1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with OpenGL® 2.0, 16-bit color, and 512MB of VRAM (1GB recommended)*  &gt;Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, membership validation, and access to online services.†",®

t5_2qh1i,BRCA1BRCA1,1370548173,"Thank you for making me laugh (""camp no. 3"").  Yes, Patagonia clothing is worth it and here's why:  1.)  It's quality.  It lasts.  Everything is well built to withstand the wear and tear of whatever activity you are doing.  The gear I have bought lasts.  It last longer than North Face, or Mountain Hardware gear/clothing that I've bought.  2.) Patagonia really does care about the environment, and by buying from them, you are helping the world (sounds cheesy but it's true.)  As you probably know, a ton of gear is synthetically produced using oil- Patagonia openly admits that fact, and then they really try and reduce their environmental impact.  Here are examples of how:         - Pay any employee $2/trip who bicycles, walks, or takes public transportation.       - 1% of all sales to conservation efforts (started in 1985)       - 100% organic cotton in all cotton containing products (they started this in 1996!)       - Recycled plastic soda bottles for fleece products, first company to do so (started in 1993)       - Shipping inventory by ground instead of air         - 1st ever neoprene-alternative wetsuit (60% plant based biorubber produced from the Guayule plant)       - 14% of their electricity at their headquarters in Ventura, CA comes from 498 solar panels       - Use of permeable cement around their buildings to let storm water seep into the soil          Materials:       - Use of Chlorine free wool, hemp, organic cotton and recycled nylons       - Recycling program specifically for these products:                      Patagonia fleece (including Synchilla® and Regulator® insulation)                     Polartec® fleece from other manufacturers                     Capilene baselayers                     Patagonia cotton T-shirts  3.) They treat their employees well.  I absolutely support any company that manages their employees the way they do.  Here are more examples:                - 8 weeks paid maternity leave        - 8 weeks paid paternity leave.         - Pay 100% percent of health insurance premiums for full and part-time workers.   Here are some incredible links to show what they do:  [patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=1964!](http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=1964)      TL DR:  Patagonia makes quality products that outlast other leading brands, they are truly and unequivocally environmentally friendly, and they respect the working man/treat their employees super-well.

That's funny, [because this is what you sound like.](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35076370.jpg) Maybe try addressing things I actually say?  Also, if you actually engage with feminist theory and literature you would know that patriarchy isn't some sort of shadowy cabal of men or any other sort of conspiracy but rather structural and systemic privilege overwhelmingly granted to men and the institution of gender roles that disenfranchise women from meaningful power. Does that mean there are some negative effects for men? Yes, we do get the short end of the stick sometimes but it's directly the result of institutionalised misogyny.  Moreover, just because an organisation self-identifies as feminist doesn't mean that everything it does is feminist so why don't you ask me what I think of the NOW's opinions on child custody before putting words in my mouth?  &gt;Also you can read a few posts up where I actually linked to something about the tender years doctrine and how it was formed.  You're right. I was preparing for a meeting with my advisor before so I only glanced over the first paragraph. My apologies.

t5_2to85,Draconics,1370554629,"7 **MCGamer** (No Movement)  *Why?*: While MC didn’t make any stupid mistakes, much of the first episode was honestly wasted for him. Much of the 20 minutes was spent on nearly doing things—from running away from a cave due to a skeleton, running away from BDoubleO, and just losing Kurt. Regardless, MC has proven himself to be a skilled player (read: Season 6, Season 8, Season 10), and deserves to remain in the top half nonetheless.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to get to work immediately.  *Season Outlook*: MC is starting to show that he could become a consistent contender and he will likely finish high.  8 **BDoubleO** (No Movement)  *Why?*: While he lacks the pedigree that pretty much everyone above him possesses (really, the only player that has been less successful out of the 7 above him is Pakratt), BOO has shown to be a quietly successful player. After finding a fair amount of gold and still with full health, BOO is doing fine.  *How Can They Improve?*: Be as efficient as he can be, and has shown to be.   *Season Outlook*: If he can keep doing what he did in Episode 1, he could finish higher than he ever has.  9 **BlameTC** (No Movement)  *Why?*: BTC had a quietly successful Season 10. Even though he doesn’t have the chance to break his Iron Kurtain record from Season 10, he has already proved that he could potentially join the ranks of the elite PvEers (read: Kurt and Beef). A slow start in terms of iron and a small amount of health lost keeps him a little down.   *How Can They Improve?*: Be as successful in PvE as he was in Season 10, and show that he is a capable PvPer.  *Season Outlook*: The Iron Kontroller has fallen? Regardless, he has time to take advantage of his PvE skills.  10 **Pyro** (No Movement)  *Why?*: This is mostly due to the fact that it seems like there will be an encounter between Pyro and a mystery person may be happening in the beginning of the next episode. Even though he had a fine start, despite losing a fair amount of health, Pyro is already an only-slightly-above-average player. Also, something that others may not be really taking into account as the fact that he’s actually playing at a reasonable time—something that may improve his gameplay greatly.   *How Can They Improve?*: Depends if this fight happens, and how it goes for him.   *Season Outlook*: Hopefully the party downstairs isn’t too distracting. He can potentially finish high if he plays like he did in S7 and if he doesn’t have an early encounter early next episode.  11 **Guude** (No Movement)  *Why?*: This is the guy where I find trouble basing previous seasons off of. I’ve been a big supporter of Guude, and have been saying that he will be going back to his winning and successful ways from S2 – S4B since Season 7. Even though he was more successful in S9 (a PvE season) and S10 (in which he displayed his still excellent tactical skills), it’s not really enough to cast away some of his previous woes. Regardless, a good start means that you cannot keep “The Fallen Champion” out of contention.  *How Can They Improve?*: Continue using his brilliant tactical abilities.  *Season Outlook*: We’ll have to see if Guude can go back to his winning ways.  12 **Shreeyam** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I put him in the middle of the cast. After a total of 20 minutes of UHC experience, there is a very small sample space to base his skill off of. He had a fine start, but I really only put him here until he is proven to be lower or higher.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to avoid silly rookie PvE mistakes, and that’s not counting any of his ability in PvP, which we have yet to see. Remember, some of the most successful rookie seasons (S3 Kurt, S5 Nebris, S6 MC, and S10 Jsano) were all by people who had excellent PvE success, and very few PvP encounters. Unless Shree is the next Anderz, PvE is the most important issue.  *Season Outlook*: Any predictions on Shree’s first season are pretty much impossible.  13 **Zisteau** (No Movement)  *Why?*: He lost a little bit of health, but he still drops low because of his little historical success. I may be completely underestimating our favorite zombie pigman, however.   *How Can They Improve?*: He has to redo everything he did in his S6 4th place run, except for decorate mountains and stand in the open while AFK.   *Season Outlook*: Like everyone else, too early to tell. I don’t expect an extremely high placing, however.  14 **Millbee** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Again, not necessarily an awful start, but I still place my 100% favorite sheep near the bottom of the list due to his past experienced in UHC. Millbee has yet to have a remotely successful season, but all of these seasons (unfortunate early encounter, bad shift key, and the Iron Kurtain) could be flukes.  *How Can They Improve?*: I kind of don’t think he wants to improve, considering he says that this will not be a very serious perspective…   *Season Outlook*: Maybe he’ll end up like S6 Zisteau, not take it seriously, and place high. For now, his track record and personality points to a low place.  15 **GenerikB** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Generik has had around the same success as Millbee. That is, very little. He’s already lost a significant amount of health for the first episode, and it already looks like yet another early exit.  *How Can They Improve?*: He’s going to get the “Dinnerboned” award at this rate.  *Season Outlook*: Low, as what has seemingly become tradition.  16 **W92Baj** (No Movement)  *Why?*: First of all, I believe Baj is a better player than his record indicates. Even though he’s never been successful in an FFA, he has been a key player in all of the successful teams that he’s been in. Regardless, that’s not enough to disregard the amount of health he lost.  *How Can They Improve?*: He must take advantage of the perma-day in order to grow his wheat better.  *Season Outlook*: Baj Grylls isn’t exactly to his best start. Baj has never had a truly successful FFA, despite showing he can work well with others, but don’t count him out early yet.  17 **DocM77** (No Movement)  *Why?*: He really shouldn’t have gone after Dinnerbone.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to pull off an amazing recovery.  *Season Outlook*: Low, considering how terrible that start was in terms of health.  18 **PauseUnpause** (No Movement)  *Why?*: “He ****ing sucks.” That unfortunate Enderman death could have been dealt with better, but it still leaves him as the 4th person to leave the game.  *How Can They Improve?*: Stop **** sucking. (I seriously hope this becomes a meme in the Mindcrack community.)  *Season Outlook*: Well, he may have gone out in the first episode, but at least he gave us one of the best UHC exits (rage quit) of all time.  19 **Jsano** (No Movement)  *Why?*: The firefighter has a sad leave, as he must exit due to net issues.  *How Can They Improve?*: Fix his internet.  *Season Outlook*: Maybe if he can fix his internet, he can come back and make a comeback for the ages.   20 **Dinnerbone** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I was seriously hoping he would get “Dinnerboned”, but getting “Doced” will have to do.  *How Can They Improve?*: Make the skeletons less evil so people won’t hate him.  *Season Outlook*: He’s going to have to go to the doctor first.  21 **Avidya** (No Movement)  *Why?*: There are no gentlemen in Ultra Hardcore.   *How Can They Improve?*: Watch for Vikings.  *Season Outlook*: Unfortunately for Avidya, Vikings aren’t gentlemen.   *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2qyt6,somnolent49,1370555097,"First, a tiny bit of background on decay heat.  Each nuclear fission produces fission fragments, which each have a portion of the original nucleus.  These fragments are radioactive, and decay into other elements.  As they decay, they produce heat.  When you turn off a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions stop almost entirely, but the fission fragments are still decaying and producing heat.  This decay heat falls off rapidly over time.  The moment a reactor is turned off, decay heat is still producing ~6.5% of the reactor's previous core power output.  Within 1 hour, it falls to 1.5%, within one day it falls to 0.4%, within a week to 0.2%.  Now to Fukushima in particular.  The earthquake happened, and the three running reactors at Fukushima Daiichi all shut down automatically, as they are designed to.  The reactor lost it's external power connection as a result of the earthquake, and was no longer producing power itself.  This caused the emergency generators to automatically turn on and continue to pump the coolant water through the core.  Unfortunately, shortly after the earthquake the tsunami arrived and flooded the basement room where all of the emergency generators were located.  This was the first VERY STUPID IDEA™ that led to the accident.  It turns out in the late 1990's, regulators had realized that there was a risk of exactly this type of scenario.  They ordered that 3 additional backup generators be constructed in a building further up the hillside.  Unfortunately, the switching station to send power from these generators to the reactor was still in the basement with the other generators, meaning they couldn't actually be connected to the reactor.  There also weren't any appropriate power connectors located at Fukushima Daiichi in order to manually connect the generators to the reactors.  This was the second VERY STUPID IDEA™.  Because the generators failed, the battery backups took over the load.  They ran for about 8 hours before failing.  As I explained earlier, decay heat disappears exponentially.  It goes from 6.5% to 1.5% in the first hour, and to 0.4% by the end of the first day.  That 8 hours of battery backup made the difference between having a very bad accident and a potentially catastrophical one.  This of course begs the question, why weren't the battery backups required to last long enough for decay heat to come down to safe levels.  This was the third VERY STUPID IDEA™.  Once the battery backups failed and the coolant pumps stopped, the reactor began to heat up, boiling water into steam and threatening to expose the reactor core to air.  At this point, a meltdown could have been averted by flooding the reactor with seawater, but this was avoided as it would have ruined the reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater only commenced once the government ordered TEPCO to do so, and by then it was already too late.  This was the fourth VERY STUPID IDEA™.  Inside the reactors the heat rose, boiling off the water inside.  This gradually exposed the reactor core to steam voids, and caused the reactor to overheat and melt.  Thanks to the high temperature, a reaction also took place between the zirconium-coated fuel rods and the remaining water in the core, generating hydrogen gas.  This hydrogen gas was vented into the building surrounding the reactor, and was the cause of the explosions some of you may remember seeing.  These were not nuclear explosions, simply hydrogen and air.  The hydrogen explosions were responsible for all of the direct loss of life as a result of the disaster, killing a number of workers.  3 of the nuclear reactors [melted down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown).  This was basically a more extreme form of what took place at Three Mile Island.",™

You do not need a TISUS result to partake in a English-only master's programme. To partake in Ph.D. programs, you need to have an advanced degree (magister (1 year, equiv. of a American master's) or master's (2 years)) and within the humanities you normally apply with your degree thesis (15 or 30 hp i.e. half semester's or full semester's worth of essay writing) and a plan for your research.

t5_2to85,Draconics,1370556938,"7 **MCGamer** (No Movement)  *Why?*: While MC didn’t make any stupid mistakes, much of the first episode was honestly wasted for him. Much of the 20 minutes was spent on nearly doing things—from running away from a cave due to a skeleton, running away from BDoubleO, and just losing Kurt. Regardless, MC has proven himself to be a skilled player (read: Season 6, Season 8, Season 10), and deserves to remain in the top half nonetheless.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to get to work immediately.  *Season Outlook*: MC is starting to show that he could become a consistent contender and he will likely finish high.  8 **BDoubleO** (No Movement)  *Why?*: While he lacks the pedigree that pretty much everyone above him possesses (really, the only player that has been less successful out of the 7 above him is Pakratt), BOO has shown to be a quietly successful player. After finding a fair amount of gold and still with full health, BOO is doing fine.  *How Can They Improve?*: Be as efficient as he can be, and has shown to be.   *Season Outlook*: If he can keep doing what he did in Episode 1, he could finish higher than he ever has.  9 **BlameTC** (No Movement)  *Why?*: BTC had a quietly successful Season 10. Even though he doesn’t have the chance to break his Iron Kurtain record from Season 10, he has already proved that he could potentially join the ranks of the elite PvEers (read: Kurt and Beef). A slow start in terms of iron and a small amount of health lost keeps him a little down.   *How Can They Improve?*: Be as successful in PvE as he was in Season 10, and show that he is a capable PvPer.  *Season Outlook*: The Iron Kontroller has fallen? Regardless, he has time to take advantage of his PvE skills.  10 **Pyro** (No Movement)  *Why?*: This is mostly due to the fact that it seems like there will be an encounter between Pyro and a mystery person may be happening in the beginning of the next episode. Even though he had a fine start, despite losing a fair amount of health, Pyro is already an only-slightly-above-average player. Also, something that others may not be really taking into account as the fact that he’s actually playing at a reasonable time—something that may improve his gameplay greatly.   *How Can They Improve?*: Depends if this fight happens, and how it goes for him.   *Season Outlook*: Hopefully the party downstairs isn’t too distracting. He can potentially finish high if he plays like he did in S7 and if he doesn’t have an early encounter early next episode.  11 **Guude** (No Movement)  *Why?*: This is the guy where I find trouble basing previous seasons off of. I’ve been a big supporter of Guude, and have been saying that he will be going back to his winning and successful ways from S2 – S4B since Season 7. Even though he was more successful in S9 (a PvE season) and S10 (in which he displayed his still excellent tactical skills), it’s not really enough to cast away some of his previous woes. Regardless, a good start means that you cannot keep “The Fallen Champion” out of contention.  *How Can They Improve?*: Continue using his brilliant tactical abilities.  *Season Outlook*: We’ll have to see if Guude can go back to his winning ways.  12 **Shreeyam** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I put him in the middle of the cast. After a total of 20 minutes of UHC experience, there is a very small sample space to base his skill off of. He had a fine start, but I really only put him here until he is proven to be lower or higher.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to avoid silly rookie PvE mistakes, and that’s not counting any of his ability in PvP, which we have yet to see. Remember, some of the most successful rookie seasons (S3 Kurt, S5 Nebris, S6 MC, and S10 Jsano) were all by people who had excellent PvE success, and very few PvP encounters. Unless Shree is the next Anderz, PvE is the most important issue.  *Season Outlook*: Any predictions on Shree’s first season are pretty much impossible.  13 **Zisteau** (No Movement)  *Why?*: He lost a little bit of health, but he still drops low because of his little historical success. I may be completely underestimating our favorite zombie pigman, however.   *How Can They Improve?*: He has to redo everything he did in his S6 4th place run, except for decorate mountains and stand in the open while AFK.   *Season Outlook*: Like everyone else, too early to tell. I don’t expect an extremely high placing, however.  14 **Millbee** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Again, not necessarily an awful start, but I still place my 100% favorite sheep near the bottom of the list due to his past experienced in UHC. Millbee has yet to have a remotely successful season, but all of these seasons (unfortunate early encounter, bad shift key, and the Iron Kurtain) could be flukes.  *How Can They Improve?*: I kind of don’t think he wants to improve, considering he says that this will not be a very serious perspective…   *Season Outlook*: Maybe he’ll end up like S6 Zisteau, not take it seriously, and place high. For now, his track record and personality points to a low place.  15 **GenerikB** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Generik has had around the same success as Millbee. That is, very little. He’s already lost a significant amount of health for the first episode, and it already looks like yet another early exit.  *How Can They Improve?*: He’s going to get the “Dinnerboned” award at this rate.  *Season Outlook*: Low, as what has seemingly become tradition.  16 **W92Baj** (No Movement)  *Why?*: First of all, I believe Baj is a better player than his record indicates. Even though he’s never been successful in an FFA, he has been a key player in all of the successful teams that he’s been in. Regardless, that’s not enough to disregard the amount of health he lost.  *How Can They Improve?*: He must take advantage of the perma-day in order to grow his wheat better.  *Season Outlook*: Baj Grylls isn’t exactly to his best start. Baj has never had a truly successful FFA, despite showing he can work well with others, but don’t count him out early yet.  17 **DocM77** (No Movement)  *Why?*: He really shouldn’t have gone after Dinnerbone.  *How Can They Improve?*: He has to pull off an amazing recovery.  *Season Outlook*: Low, considering how terrible that start was in terms of health.  18 **PauseUnpause** (No Movement)  *Why?*: “He ****ing sucks.” That unfortunate Enderman death could have been dealt with better, but it still leaves him as the 4th person to leave the game.  *How Can They Improve?*: Stop **** sucking. (I seriously hope this becomes a meme in the Mindcrack community.)  *Season Outlook*: Well, he may have gone out in the first episode, but at least he gave us one of the best UHC exits (rage quit) of all time.  19 **Jsano** (No Movement)  *Why?*: The firefighter has a sad leave, as he must exit due to net issues.  *How Can They Improve?*: Fix his internet.  *Season Outlook*: Maybe if he can fix his internet, he can come back and make a comeback for the ages.   20 **Dinnerbone** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I was seriously hoping he would get “Dinnerboned”, but getting “Doced” will have to do.  *How Can They Improve?*: Make the skeletons less evil so people won’t hate him.  *Season Outlook*: He’s going to have to go to the doctor first.  21 **Avidya** (No Movement)  *Why?*: There are no gentlemen in Ultra Hardcore.   *How Can They Improve?*: Watch for Vikings.  *Season Outlook*: Unfortunately for Avidya, Vikings aren’t gentlemen.   *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2qyt6,Hiddencamper,1370558698,"&gt; This of course begs the question, why weren't the battery backups required to last long enough for decay heat to come down to safe levels.  In nuclear power safety analysis, a loss of power grid with a loss of onsite diesel generators for &gt;8 hours is not a credible event (and is extremely rare). The onsite diesels are supposed to be protected from all environment hazards and common cause failures, so then the only things that would get you to a station blackout are multiple random failures occurring simultaneously. The concept that you would have grid failure, plus onsite failure, without being able to restore power in 8 hours was considered beyond 1 in 10 million, so they never were designed for that.  Either way, unit 1's batteries failed entirely, and unit 2's batteries were intermittent. Some worked, some didnt, and some came in and out. So even if they had enough battery power, several of them were flooded.  Ultimately, if batteries dont last more than 8 hours, you need to have an alternate way to get water in the core or restore battery power until you can get portable generators on site.  &gt; At this point, a meltdown could have been averted by flooding the reactor with seawater, but this was avoided as it would have ruined the reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater only commenced once the government ordered TEPCO to do so, and by then it was already too late. This was the fourth VERY STUPID IDEA™.  The reactors were still at rated pressure, and they couldn't depressurize them. They didnt have enough DC power to hold the SRVs open, and they ran out of pressurized nitrogen to lift the valves with. With unit 3, they were bringing pressure down using its remaining battery power, then they shut off the HPCI pump BEFORE starting seawater injection. By the time they started injection, the SRV lost air pressure and closed, and reactor pressure rose above the seawater injection pump pressure, so that failed. Unit 2 wasn't much different. They essentially didn't ensure their SRVs had adequate air supply and DC power to remain open so they could depressurize in the first place. In unit 2, when they were injecting seawater, the pit they were drawing from ran out of water, and they lost injection for several hours while they tried to get more water into the pit. This wasn't good either. The real stupid idea here was that they didnt have a prepared plan on how to keep the water pit levels high.",™

t5_2qh2p,rupturedprolapse,1370559930,"&gt;What you're saying is that deism is compatible with science, not theism. Any of the Abrahamic religions are inherently theisms.    I'd venture to say the only thing needed to fulfill my opinion would be a belief in a higher power. Whether it's a Sim City God™ or one too cool to care about people really doesn't matter.    The people who rally against science are usually people who are the **vocal** minority and have extreme views.     The studies here a out-dated  and I'd guess the numbers are much less now but [I'll toss it out there anyway](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Approximately_what_percentage_of_recognized_Scientists_believes_in_Creation).     &gt;A lesser proportion would believe in creation; it is known that many of the general population who believe in God do not necessarily believe in a literalist version of the Creation story. In fact, Biblical-literalist creationism is considered a fringe belief.    I do like that one snippet. Summary from the link is basically that the sciences do have significantly less people of some sort of faith, but they're still there. The only study they specifically mention by date though is over a decade old, so take it with a grain of salt.    &gt;evolution and atomic theory on the surface are much more conflicting for supernatural claims.    I think generally evolution is indisputable along with atomic theory. I don't think the majority of people who have beliefs get their jimmies rustled over the existence of electrons or how DNA can predict the probability of a person having an inheritable condition.     I only see science and belief being mutually exclusive if your beliefs interfere with what you're willing to accept from science. Generally religion has less bearing now on how people see the world then it did 200 years ago.     My point for entering the thread in general, is that I support the direction /r/atheism is taking. I'm an atheist, but have avoided this sub because what pops up on the front page is arguably bigoted. Religion isn't the problem, it's when shitty people use it to justify interfering with public policy, science and personal rights that it becomes an issue. ",™

You then get upset and say I'm ignoring your overarching point, which you even quote for clarity.  That point is that the word ""Arms"" basically means ""guns"".  It is a facially illogical argument.  Any six year old with a set of revolution-era war themed Lego® Blocks knows canons and swords and all sorts of other Arms were available at the time.

t5_2qhk3,HMRambo,1370581477,"Gentlemen, this is John Rambo, Anti-Feminist Soldier. I am posting this on behalf of Peter-Andrew: Nolan© also now known as Joschua-Brandon: Boehm©. I am doing this because, as a young men who knows Peter well, I know he has our best interests at heart.  Gentlemen, It is well known that five years ago, April 2008, I spent a month suicidal as I went through the process of disowning my former children. When I came out of that rather unpleasant experience I contacted other men who had been similarly affected. I realized that many men were killing themselves because of the criminal abuse of the family law courts all across the western English speaking world.  As a direct result of this experience, and my compassion for my fellow men, I made a vow in June 2008 to re-introduce the rule of law into Australia and Ireland.  Naturally, at the time I made the vow I had no idea how that might be done. We call it “throw your hat over the wall”. You make the vow and “figure it out later”.  Along the way I have talked to many tens of thousands of men, perhaps as many as 100,000 men have seen at least one comment by me one way or another. What I heard from men in 2008 was that they were DESPERATE for a remedy for the crimes being committed against them in the family courts. They were DESPERATE to find a way to end the criminal effects of feminism on their lives. Because so many men told me the same thing I mistook this to mean they actually WANTED to solve the problems of the family courts and feminism. As I said. My mistake.  Through very extensive research and labour, and collaborating with the best and brightest, the remedy for both the family courts and feminism was proven on 2009-11-26. A mere 18 months after I was suicidal. The court meeting that I did on 2009-11-26 I regard as one of the finest achievements of my life. Regardless? The very men I risked my life to create a remedy for have ignored that remedy, preferring to whine, bitch, moan and complain because that is far more rewarding to them than actually solving their problems. If they solved their problems they would have nothing to whine, bitch, moan and complain about.  The remedy has now been available 2.5 times as long as it took to develop and has proved uniquely unpopular. I am hated for even talking about it. The blood of every man who kills himself due to criminal abuse in the family courts is on the hands of those perhaps 100,000+ men who have heard from me and done nothing. I did all I could. They did not. It is actually very simple.  The mechanism for men to free themselves now is the Mens Business Association. The MBA provides individual based services to get men out of the control grid. Such services may well save the mans life from suicide. Going forward? It is necessary to create second economy outside the control of any government entity. Why criminals in governments can dominate and control men via the economy they will continue to do so. There is no reason for them to stop. The MBA is the proposal of a second economy outside the control of the government. This is a NECESSARY ingredient for men to live in freedom.  Only a small percentage of men will want to live in freedom. Those men who want to live in freedom? You are invited to watch a short update on how we are going in our efforts to get the second economy going. Naturally? The second economy will grow just as quickly or slowly as men join in and contribute to it. Those who want to “stick with the government run economies”? You are welcome to do so.  I wish you luck with that because you are going to need it.  best regards   your brother peter   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXDBDzsAk0 ",©

Men are just more interested in these things, and the women who are interested in them *do not give a fuck* about any of the things that non-gamer feminist blowhards like Sarkeesian whine about in a very one-sided way that rejects a ton of evidence to the contary.

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1370585420,"&gt; completion is often intended to express a fulfillment of prophecy  Yes, but prophecies are not fulfilled yet❣  &gt; fear used this way is not fear in the modern sense. See [here](http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/fear.html) for further ..  I agree upon ""knowledge of the Holy One"" but the rest on that page is exactly about the conventional use of ""fear"" and is so specialized that the word fear should never ever be used in this context. It's simply wrong word.  It's like saying something is free, when it is not free but gratis.  My hypothesis for the strong ""marketing"" about atheism today is that this ""fear of God"" is destructive for the human mind, as ""fear"" make people associate with a despote, who you have to believe in, to not be killed or sent to hell, but definitely not a ""holy One""...  In Swedish we use the word ""vördnad"" or ""högakta"" where the former in English seems to be [""veneration""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration), but never ever something similar to ""fear"". The word ""högakta"" I can not find a translation for, google translate proposed ""esteem"" but that is not even a word in English, or is it? Ah yes, it is used as in ""self esteem"".  So the more correct word would be *God esteem*, but it seems to be very little used, but I found a [discussion here](http://jdlarsenmn.tripod.com/Godesteem.htm). ",❣

t5_2x5s1,fairwellIMJA,1370604619,"&gt;Unless the SAA suddenly got like 10 new full strength divisions over the past few days,   That is exactly what happened. And the line of Syrian volunteers to be trained and battle the rebels grows ever longer.  &gt;It is also very close to Turkey from which they can easily bring reinforcements or supplies if they need to.   Consider this rout to be the new Syrian pilot training rang. Anything moving south of the border should be considered a little ducky moving across the target range like in some carnival game. Easy pickings! Though spotters should be used to insure the pilots can find the targets quickly. A few hundred men, the planes no longer bombing Qusayr and  that border will be renamed ""the suicide line"".  &gt;the influence of Hezbollah has been greatly exaggerated  No argument from me on that point. That was a propaganda ploy to label this a sectarian war. I think that backfired as the Syrian Sunnis are distancing themselves from the Saudi Wahhabi/Salafi. (This may be much more important than any one is letting on at the moment!)  ---- Around last December the SAA changed their tactics from trying to have a few men everywhere to having lots of men where they are needed the most.   The SAA absolutely will retake Aleppo, even if they have to flatten it first. This is to put the kibosh on the Wests dream of having a ""Kurdish corridor"" (http://nsnbc.me/2013/02/06/a-kurdish-corridor-to-be-set-up-by-the-us-israel/) and cut off supplies for the rebels coming from Turkey and through that strategic city. By the time Geniva-2 happens the rebels will not have enough cards in their hand to play the game.   The longer Assad waits to go to Rastan, the more rebels will be killed by the Kurds. Thinking Assad will waist men to go their is silly.   Qusayr was the most, or second most entrenched base for the rebels. The relative ease the SAA retook Qusayr was astonishing. That city was set up to last out a year-long siege and yet it fell in a few short weeks with losses of the rebels and the SAA at about 100 to 1 respectively. The rebels in Aleppo should say their prayers now, as their days are numbered, and it's a rather small number.   The Russians have sent another three huge landing ships with weapons to Syria. (They're on their way, expected to arrive in a few days.) So the SAA can feel free to use up ammo like it's going out of style.   ---  ---  PS: Love your username!

t5_2qh2p,Abomonog,1370606398,"&gt;On what basis would this be allowed/ make sense? Did he really expect he could win that lawsuit? (He didn't, right? Please tell me he didn't.)  Winning is secondary to the lawsuit. The primary reason for the lawsuit is to incur as much expense to the university as possible in order to force them to raise tuition beyond the reach of most of the students in the state. The second goal is to elevate the lawsuit to the Supreme Court which is very sympathetic to corporate powers and likely to rule in his favor (because climate change science makes life hard on corporations).  &gt;Again, on what grounds? I seriously don't understand the GOP's position of freedom™!!, while simultaneously wanting to control what goes on in people's bedrooms. How is that stuff any of their business?  The GOP wants to take us back to late Victorian age where everything was on a ""don't ask, don't tell"" basis. It was a time where homosexuality was aggressively prosecuted in the courts and crimes against women and children were nearly always quietly swept under the rug. The Tea Party would like to go even further, back to the pre-revolutionary war colonial days. When you hear people like Sarah Palin talk about America's religious beginnings they are attributing this autonomous government to the likes of George Washington and crew. To put it quite frankly our Colonial government made the current Islamic ones look damned liberal. [It even had a uniquely cruel punishment system that  condoned the ridicule and torture of those accused of a crime by the public.](http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)   Even being perceived to have performed work on Sunday was a crime. Adultery was a crime punishable by death. By torture for the male, often starvation for the female (unless an Indian tribe took in the now branded and ostracized female, death by starvation and/or exposure was very likely).   Ironically, for most crimes you could escape punishment by merely reading a certain passage from the Bible (psalm 51).   ""A man's home is his castle."" Remember this quote when dealing with GOP politics. Their laws aren't so much designed to police the bedroom inasmuch as make sure nothing ever gets out of it. ""In America everything is legal so long as you are not caught."" This is the GOP mindset and the world they wish to create would have this as its primary rule. Where there would be castles there would be no police and very little government. Those who cannot afford a castle, however, would find their very existence a prison. Welcome to GOPland.    Edit: blasted errors.",™

I think this view that sex is some inherently special God given activity is one of the big things that cause people such a hangup on the topic. Because people view it as such a Big Deal™ it causes way too much anxiety and apprehension including unrealistic expectations.   Think of it like a bowling. A super sweet bowling outing.

t5_2qil9,eXeApoth,1370638543,"If you want to try EWAR then I highly reccomend just giving them all a go, and I think saying it's the absolute strongest may be pushing it, but essentially let's briefly compare:  ECM: Not as reliable as damps (the act of jamming is based on a calculation of jam strangth vs sensor strength of the ship, whereas damps work just like turrets with optimal/falloff), people are far more used to dealing with it, and people hate ECM so much that if they see you with a bunch of blackbirds they may just not fight (known as blueballing). E-UNI had and for some people still has a reputation for ECM blobbing, amking a lot of people not wnat to engage.  Target painting: It does help, but generally you're only ever shooting at one target, so stacking penalties means that 3-4 painters are all you'll ever need for most fights.  Tracking disruption: Useless against missiles, does nothing to reduce the effectiveness of enemy EWAR or logistics.  Obviously this biased towards the negative sides, and in many situations one is better than the other for such and such a reason, but in general i believe that in most situations you have more options to apply damps and to make the useful.  As with all things in EVE, I reccomend you try all of them and see what's the most fun. Probably the best thing for you would be EVE-UNIs Noobs on Patrol fleets, where everyone rocks up in whatever they want to fly. You can try out all kinds of stuff and even if you lose your ship the hull will be reimbursed, and then your insurance will cover the cost of the modules.  Hope that helps!  Apoth ♥",♥

I was talking about my mom because she does the same thing, she speaks about men as if they're animals and never to trust them. I have two brothers and it bothers me to hear her say this- am I not to trust my own brothers? Are her own sons not an exception?   I would be devastated if I found out my own mother were lecturing my brothers about all women being gold-diggers and sluts, and never to trust women. And I'm sure if my brothers knew she was constantly lecturing me about the dangers of men they would be offended too.   I mean, if the genders were reversed on that comment and it was a young woman feeling upset that her father was posting things about women being useless, a majority of the users here would be extremely supportive and find it to be sexist- no doubt. But just because he's a man we have to dismiss his feelings? Suddenly sexism towards men is non-existent, or should be invalidated? BS.   A young man should be able to talk about the sexism he's endured without people mocking him and saying ""no, women have it worse!!!"" I'm not gonna lie, I usually do think women have it worse, but that isn't the point. This isn't the oppression Olympics, men and women should be fighting *together*, not against each other.

t5_2rfxx,LullabyGaming,1370655172,"Might not be for everyone, but Annie is who I'd pick.  She's really strong against most champions if played well, and her build possibilities are pretty damn versatile compared to many other AP champions.  One build I've fallen in love with for top lane is Spectral Wraith, Liandry's and Rylai's. You get spell vamp from Q last hits, you have Rylai's slow for Q and what's best about this is that Rylai's and Liandry's both proc from Tibbers' passive AOE fire. This brings out a MASSIVE amount of damage in a teamfight. It also of course procs spell vamp.  One amazing thing too is that Annie's E, the shield, procs all of those items when you're hit as well.  I usually take teleport and early homeguards for some crazy TP gank possibilities whether I'm mid or top.  Sometimes I also like buying Lich Bane on Annie. It's quite scary when you think about 625 range Lich Bane procs.  Annie is by far the most cute champion in the game, she has a fantastic list of skins to her *(Which I all own, by the way)* and she is really easy to get in to. She's only 450 IP too!  She also makes up for a great kill lane support if played well and she's actually not that bad of a jungler either, now that Spectral Wraith is in the game. She has a pretty weak first clear but as soon as you get Spiritstone you can easily clear the camps, and her ganks are quite damn scary.  I understand this might not be everyone's cup of tea, but goddamnit I love her so much. ♥",♥

Their true power comes from the fact that much of the population gets them.   When this is the case, the immunity of the entire population makes it extremely difficult for disease to spread.

t5_2qh1m,Cust0dian,1370691400,"It's hard to be good web designer *and* front-end developer at the same time, in my experience. Not impossible, though.   ###Web design There's much more thought being put into what will be good for user, targeting the right audience, providing a better flow throughout the website/webapp.   There's also a trend for ""flat"" design, but it's a trend, as Web2.0 was, so there are [pros](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design) and [cons](http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2013/05/calling-bull-on-flat-design/) to it. *[Personally, I agree with Todd Burton on it](https://medium.com/design-ux/98913bbdcfa4)*  We also starting to look at the web as a different medium and coming up with *responsive design*, when website/webapp adjusts to device/media it's being viewed at—as a concrete example, iPhone's browser will get different layout/presentation than iPad's, iPad's browser will get different presentation than maximized browser on a huge desktop monitor, so on.  ###Front-end dev We are approaching a more programmatic approach—HTML, CSS, JS are separated as much as possible and handle only their respective domains (actual content for HTML, how it looks and interacts for CSS, business logic for JS).  Semantics (what HTML elements actually mean) is taken way more seriously, so no more table layouts. There are a bunch of new HTML5 elements, such as `header`, `footer`, etc., you can read about them in [specification](http://developers.whatwg.org/).  To answer your questions:  1. *How do you export from Photoshop?*   Fairly high-quality mockups, to get a sign-off from a client mostly. Would love to work straight in browser (we actually can painlessly do it today with developer tools in all major browsers and tools like [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) or [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)), but I can't find a way to incorporate this approach into my business process yet.  2. *What program are u using for editing?*   [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [Tomorrow Night color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) and [Phoenix Dark UI theme](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme). Coda is awesome as well. Doesn't really matter, anything with syntax highlighting will do, even [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (and it's free).  3. *How do you write you CSS?*   I start blank, with [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as a starting point. Continue on with [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) in mind and [BEM](http://bem.info/) (well, [BEMish](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)) syntax. It might be too much if you touched CSS long ago. Just try to notice when you write similar rules for different selectors and combine them in one.   Oh, as /r/krues8dr pointed out, I use Sass as well, but coming from a purely Windows environment, command-line was the only option until recently if you wanted to use Sass/Compass. Now there a [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) (it's free *and* [open-source](https://github.com/sbspk/Prepros/)). **Use it as soon as you've read about preprocessors**. Here's a [chapter about preprocessors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/preprocessors) (from a [Shay Howe's HTML&amp;CSS Advanced Guide](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/) I linked below) and [some rationale why most devs choose Sass](http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/) over other preprocessors. Also, [Susy is just beautiful](http://susy.oddbird.net/).  4. *Do you have a lot of snippets?*   Yes. Full Internet of them, really. [Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_Reference), [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/), [Nicolas Gallagher's blog](http://nicolasgallagher.com/), [Harry Roberts' blog](http://csswizardry.com/), [Lea Verou's blog](http://lea.verou.me/) have a lot of good stuff, and it's just a few off the top of my head. You will find something useful in [HTML5 Boilerplate's CSS](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css). Google your problem/intention and you'll probably will see a [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/css) link with answer. You'll also see a w3schools link. [Don't open it (this is a link, read it, please)](http://www.w3fools.com/).  5. *Which sites do you follow?*   All of the mentioned above, plus anybody you can find in [HTML5 Boilerplate's Contributors List](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/graphs/contributors). After some time you'll find a lot of good people and start noticing that some names pop out more than the others. Follow them.   Also [Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/), [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io/), [Web Platform Daily](http://webplatformdaily.org/), [Web Design Weekly](http://web-design-weekly.com/).  6. *Do you have other tips?*   Don't get discouraged by how quicky everything changes and how much information you need to process every day, just keep pushing, *make the web a better place™*.   If you think this comment has good points, continue on reading /u/probookair's [comment, that has even more information on the matter](http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1fx4t5/how_do_web_designers_work_nowadays/caetav3). Also, if you have some spare time, take a look at [WebPlatform](http://www.webplatform.org/) ([quick video about what it is](http://youtu.be/Ug6XAw6hzaw)) and [contribute something](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Getting_Started#Basic_tasks) to it, so we have a centralized resource for such kind of questions in the future.  *EDIT:* Added more links, because they are tasty. + Added more info on preprocessors. + Added a link to useful comment by /u/probookair and a link to WebPlatform.   (If only we had a revision history for comments, so that redditors don't need to type these ^ things out... We'd call it *KarmaOverflow*.) ",™

t5_2s7k2,JasonMacker,1370697148,"&gt;I think what The_Zulk meant was that you've made the whole conversation about Christianity again, just like the people the was talking about in his self-post. I've seen that Islam-fellating ex-Christians (not talking about you here) have a tendency to shove Christianity in discussions about Islam and then attempt to justify Islam's negative aspects by listing negative aspects of Christianity. That's idiotic. Just because Christians have done bad stuff because of their religion doesn't mean we shouldn't criticise Muslims (and their religion) when they do bad stuff because of their religion. If A does something bad, it doesn't make it okay for B to do something bad too.  No, the whole point of bringing up Christianity is to disprove the false claim that Islam is uniquely violent. That's why it's critically important to bring up Christianity so that you can verify whether the person is being *honest* in their criticisms of Islam, or is simply being one-sided and failing to grasp that Islam is not uniquely violent. If someone is willing to gloss over Christian violence but interprets any violence committed by Muslims as driven purely by religion, then that is a problem.  Can you think of a better heuristic to tell whether or not someone is being consistent in their criticism of religion?  Also, what the fuck is ""Islam-fellating""? Would you like it if I called you ""Christianity-fellating"" for your refusal to engage in honest criticism of Christianity? Grow up.  &gt;I've noticed, especially on Reddit, that any criticism of Islam is interpreted by libtards as a call to war against Muslims. That is NOT what everyone means anytime they dispraise Islam godammit. If I had a penny for every time I've seen people on r/atheism treating Islam like it's sacrosanct and going on and on about how it's not right for us to criticise it, I'd have a closet full of pennies.  First of all, I'm not entirely sure what ""libtard"" means in this context. Second, if you're referring to reddit's userbase as being sympathetic to Islam, that's horseshit. Stories with a negative portrayal of Islam get upvoted through the roof on /r/worldnews and /r/atheism all the time. Are you using the same reddit as me?  &gt;I am defending the right of people to make valid criticisms of Islam without having their heads bitten off.  You mean, a right that people have basically always had and there is no necessity in ""defending"" it? If your right can be defended by making comments on reddit, that's right probably can survive without your defense.  And I think the contention here is whether or not these criticisms are valid in the first place, is it not? Should people have the right to make *invalid* criticisms of Islam? If yes, then why do you make the distinction of only valid criticisms of Islam?  &gt;We all know about the Crusades and abortion clinic bombings and attack on Babri Masjid.  Actually, no we don't. There are plenty of people that deny that the Crusades were A Bad Thing™. And like I mentioned, there seems to be a very strange interest in what Christians have done centuries ago, yet Christians in modern history as well as contemporary times are still behaving badly (so to speak) yet nobody seems to think that's of concern.  &gt;There are more important aspects of Islam than terror e.g. the misogyny, the homophobia, the pedophilia, the animal cruelty, the slavery, the anti-Semitism, the mistreatment of human beings, the double standards, the Allah-sanctioned discrimination, etc. We should be able to call out Islam on these things without being labelled an Islamophobe whose ignoring evil parts of other religions.  Again, you're conflating criticism of Islam with Islamophobia. Let's say someone says ""I don't want my children to go to the same school as Muslim children"". Is that ""criticism of Islam""? No, it's Islamophobia. That is what is being opposed here... xenophobia.",™

This is just the way I was concieved; I was born a consumer.  I don't see how you can make this type of existentialist claim. You could say, for instance, that you never chose to exist (as in, being born), or that you don't have a choice in paying taxes for things that you don't support, but you'd have a hard time justifying that you were ""born a consumer."" In any case, now that you've become existentially aware, then stop being a ""consumer,"" or whatever it is. Do what you want; grow your own food, etc. Live authentically and in accord with your virtues; smoke weed if you want to, snort cocaine if you want to, sit at home and just draw pictures. Do whatever you want. The only person who is stopping you is yourself (and, the state).  &gt;Buy, buy, buy! At Soulless Corporation™, we care about our customers! But more shit and your life will be infinitely better! Who believes that? It's pretty sad.  Well, if you don't think your life will be infinitely better, then don't support it by buying it. Only support businesses you think aren't soulless and convince the people you know. Live authentically and do as you will and believe is virtuous. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy). Moreover, I don't know how the government is supposed to fix this problem. People are being ridiculous and living shallow lives... Should the government be coming in and regulating our lives for us? Sheesh.  &gt;While what you're saying makes sense on a very simplistic level, it's not necessarily always true - people are not always better off. We have to consider research on the following:  Then these are negative externalities for which people must be compensated, or actions that produce negative externalities must be enjoined because they impose unconsented costs on others, and/or damage their livelihood.  &gt;Whether consumerism is good for our collective psychological well-being  Who cares? I get to determine my own psychological well-being. Even if you are well-intentioned, I get to do what I want. You don't get to shape the rules so that the world can conform to your notion of psychological well-being. If a girl wants to buy Louis Vuitton bags, she can. If you think she's living a virtueless life, then you're free to tell her that and try to persuade her of your views.  &gt;Environmental risks  You aren't allowed to pollute, etc., because you are negatively harming others (throwing clouds of toxins in the air which other people breathe) and you are damaging their property, etc. The government is *not doing its job* when it doesn't prohibit this type of pollution because it is failing to carry out justice for those who harm others (public loss, private gain). A big reason why the gov. isn't enforcing is because these polluting corporations (big energy, big oil, etc.) are the ones who fund their campaigns and get them elected in the first place.   Quote from Murray Rothbard on this topic: ""The major function of government — of courts and police — is to stop aggression; instead, the government has failed in this task and has failed grievously to exercise its defense function against air pollution.""  &gt;The utter bullshit some businesses get away with selling  You're right. We can solve this problem by trying to talk to others and showing them that things are bad. Sometimes businesses get away with selling bullshit, but things are getting better with the greater access to information available through the internet.  &gt;The negative effects profit-driven business models have had on once-meaningful products  Profit-making does not preclude doing things that are meaningful (though I am not arguing that you are necessarily suggesting this). Profit is just the amount of money people are willing to pay you for the value you add to inputs. If I have a piece of bread I bought for $1 and some peanut butter I bought for $2, and I put together a peanut-butter sandwich and sell it for $4, then I've made a profit (where profit simply equals revenue minus expenses). I've made a $1 profit off the peanut-butter sandwich. If people wanted to make the sandwich themselves, they could have bought the inputs. Instead, they want to do other things in life, and so they are willing to compensate me for the value I have added to the bread and peanut butter (putting them together into a packaged sandwich for their lunch).  Regardless, if you feel that some businesses are just out there to be ruthless and profit-making, rather than having good corporate ethics, then you're free to not fund them. On the contrary, if you believe invading other countries or telling gay people they can't marry is wrong, are forced to continue funding such an institution.  &gt;Class warfare  Class warfare is just envy. Envy is not justified grounds for anything. Class warfare is only problematic when people use the force of the state (e.g., getting bailouts, subsidies, imposing select taxes on people and groups, rubbing out competition, etc.). Otherwise, we can solve all these problems if people just lived reflectively and authentically. If some rich guy is a dick to a poor person, then don't deal with him; tell all your friends he's a douche and ostracize him. If a poor person is an asshole, do the same.  &gt;Children not being afforded a quality education which increases their chances of not making choices that are destructive to themselves and society. This is a big one for the Liberal Party.  This is certainly true, but do you honestly believe that children are taught well by government run schools, which are really just beholden to teacher's unions' special interest? A lot of public schools are failures, yet parents are forced to fund them. Normally, if something is failing and does poorly, then it gets replaced by something better. With public schools, we throw *more money* at the worst schools and expect them to magically do better, meanwhile we ignore underlying causes of the school's failure. If the problem is access to education for the needy, then a system of school vouchers would ensure the best outcomes, since parents will be able to choose better schools for their children.  Regardless, having the state run education is not necessarily a good thing. Do you think if Coca-Cola ran the schools, that the kids would get objective information concerning sugary drinks? If not, then why do you think if the government ran schools, that children would get objective information concerning the reality of the state, or the mental training required to be critical of the powers that be?  &gt;Money is power, right? How do you justify wanting people with money to have more power by diminishing the closest thing we have to a representative of the people, the democratically elected government? You're advocating sacrificing the interests of the whole for the interests of a few.  But that's such a myth! Do you *actually* believe that politicians are representatives of the people? Your local bank's customer service agent is more beholden and an honest representative of your wants and concerns than a politician in Canberra. No way politicians are representative of the people; do you think they have a legal contract binding them to what they said during their campaigns to what they will do in office? Why else are people so distrustful of politicians? It's because most politicians are demagogues. They say what they have to say on the campaign trail, then just do what they want when they're in power. They dole out money to special interest groups to ensure that they get reelected. If it were really a matter of democracy, why is it that every parliament and every single leader never enjoys &gt;50% approval? Gillard had low approval ratings two years ago and is still in office. Do you think that anyone who replaces her, within 6 months, is going to have a positive approval rating just a little ways down the line? No. History tells us so, and every politician disappoints and fails precisely because they don't actually represent the will of the people. The will of people is carried out by what people do voluntary (such as care for their children and bringing them to piano classes, babysitting your neighbor's cat, etc.). The moment you have to force people through the armed force of the state to do x, you know that people mustn't naturally want to do x, or else they would've just done it without being impelled.    They clearly don't represent the interests of the people when they censor what you can do, or engage in reckless spending or ridiculous scandals. This occurs over and over again; the myth that the government is somehow beholden to the people is really just out of touch with the real political shell-game. You have a better chance getting a refund on your telephone bill than contacting your MP (who's supposed to represent you!) and getting him/her to actually do something.  I am not looking out for the interests of the few. I'm looking out for individuals and individual rights. I really resent being told that I'm for the interest of the few. It's really offensive to say that I'm out there to back big CEOs over regular people. I am for individuals and individual rights, which means protection against violence and fraud and corporatism (which is corporations mixed with government, which is what inevitably happens in the political game). You do this by empowering actual individuals, rather than proxy institutions that have a track-record of lying to us. No corporation should get any sort of special privilege or subsidy from the state; every corporation should have to compete as hard as it can and be completely beholden to the real people who actually desire the goods/services it provides. No entity, corporation or person, should be allowed to injure others (including their health, etc.) or their property, or falsely represent themselves for economic gain (fraud, which is essentially theft).   The reality is that government and politicians get bought out by special interests. Why doesn't special interest call you up on the phone? Because you don't have the power to give them anything. Take away the power for corporate welfare, make companies accountable to their actual customers, and leave money in the pockets of those who earned it rather than doling it out through political channels to cronies. That's how you make sure you're acting in the interests of actual people!",™

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1370749247,"Thanks for your elaborate answer. This time I'll answer very brief.  &gt; So many comments! You know can edit your comments, don't you? :)  :-) I use to do like that as my thought process and discovery process is sequential, and the recipient can not see when a message has been updated, and what is new. When I edit messages I just change spelling errors or replace a badly chosen word with a more suitable word, but I avoid changing the meaning of the message.  &gt; a non-canon book. I don't believe Jesus said this  The selection of what is canonical or apocryphical or later discovered (like the Gospel of Thomas) is arbitrary as it is made by humans, and I do not believe in other humans. If what is said is similar to something I could have said myself, after some thinking, then I consider it genuine, if not, false.  &gt; God's ways are beyond us. This is a truth often repeated in scripture  Something doesn't become more truth due to repetition. For my own I would compare with one of our largest problem today in communication, ""spam"", which is a symptom of this non-working society.  Regarding ""God's ways are beyond us."" I do of course agree, as we do not know the intention with the game. The only way I can act and think is by my logic and my open mind.  &gt; Why would his thoughts bear any relevance to ours? You might as well compare ours to ants.  Now I may be picky but this is of course a limit with the English language (as also my language Swedish), i.e. lacking a neutral third person pronomen. I wouldn't use ""he"" about a being we do not know.  Regarding ants I have considerable more respect for them than many humans. Humans that are greedy, search for power, control, money, use violence, create wars, oppress other people, tell them how to think and how to behave are below the level of ants, as ants do not do this, they collaborate. However, I consider these people to be victims. In another world scenario they could have been good people.  &gt;&gt; I do not believe in countries nor borders. They create conflicts.  You never commented on this.  &gt; this is the pattern of the bible.  but, this implies that you have complete trust in something compiled and selected by other people. People who may have completely misunderstood things, and thus may have changed the actual meaning.   &gt; So when Jesus accepts the book of exodus,  did he? I read his comment about this as not being an acceptance of truth reasons but an acceptance of tactical reasons. As he also explicity said in Math 5.17 that it will be invalidated, as he said:  *I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished*  &gt; Have you actually read the book of exodus?  Yes, but only in the form in the translated (1917) Swedish version, and it was 40 years ago. However, I have always found it very strange. A God acting like that is not a God I would accept. God in Exodus behaves like a stubborn upset human, acting more like a despote in vain, than a wise loving super being, but as you say, we do not know the reasons.  &gt; This is not an answer to my question. I said what if a new strategy was devised, not *could* a new strategy be devised.  If a new strategy would be devised, it would show that Jesus was in error, and I do not believe this, as I have no way to imagine such an alternative strategy myself.  &gt; I believe Jesus's purpose was to inaugurate the kingdom, but the kingdom is not a mere earthly kingdom.  Remember that Jesus said that the [kingdom of God is within you](http://www.tm.org/blog/enlightenment/jesus-christ-kingdom-god-within-you/).  &gt; So it's not about which is the most effective, but the most ethical? Doesn't this contradict your earlier rejection of morality as flowing from science?  I may have expressed myself in an ambiguous way.  My mind is pure logic, thus also defines ""moral"" (even though I do not like the word ""moral""). Science is what describes my mind's relation with this world (e.g. physics and world modelling). My mind has nothing to do with this world. All I can see is that the world is weird, thus need to be fixed. The reason why the world is weird I do not know, the only thing I know is how it can be fixed, which is to throw out the currently ruling God, i.e. [Mammon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon), which has destroyed this world.  I just say, I'm glad you took the time to answer in that elaborate way❣ Keep your faith❣ Things will be alright❣  As I'm a computer scientist, you may be interested in my view of ethics and thinking. 1 1/2 years ago I wrote this short essay denoted [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15).    PS. I can tell that the reason I dislike the word ""moral"" is because such a word is only needed if one's values and ethical system would not be coherent with one's actions. That is, the being behaving would be false.  PPS. I noticed that my ""very brief"" reply may not fulfil the criterion for ""brief"" :-)",❣

We have known since the birth of literature that our will is always subject to the contraints of our material existence. To say that you are somehow submitting this will to *some other agent* because you are required to get a vaccine is a triviality of perspective.

t5_2w2s8,type40tardis,1370757840,"&gt;1) They are modified to be more resistant to pesticides, allowing crops to be sprayed more often. This leads to further soil degradation at the very least, and potentially a further build up of pesticides in the plant itself, which is then consumed.  Provide a source for this claim. I have only seen modifications that provide resistance to glyphosphate (an herbicide), which is not very toxic to humans at all. It becomes inactive when it binds to soil, and has a rather short half life. Please explain the mechanism by which the herbicide could ""potentially build up... in the plant itself"". You might also want to explain the fact that, even with maximal residual glyphosphate on the plants, a person eating a lifetime of of these plants would experience [no ill effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#Toxicity).  If you're thinking about Bt, which is actually a pesticide, it's completely natural--which I'm sure makes you think that it's fantastic. It is completely--even in principle--inert to humans, and is a perfect way to kill pests. It only affects insects.  &gt;2) They are modified such that the plants don't produce viable seeds, locking farmers into perpetual contracts with companies such as monsanto.   This is true of hybrid plants. The offspring are viable, but the desirable traits are not as strongly expressed as they would be in the first generation. This is why farmers have been buying new crops every year for decades. It's not because of the ~Evil Monsanto™~.  &gt;Have a look into the levels of suicide among indian farmers, I'll leave it up to to decide if Monsanto and it's ilk are responsible for that.  Thanks for leaving it up to me, because that's complete bullshit.  http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/03/demolishing-myth-monsantos-engineered-cr  http://i.imgur.com/PCQsApv.jpg  As for the rest of your post, GMO plants are more sustainable than organic. They take less nutrients, less space, and less time to produce bigger, hardier, more nutritious crops. They require fewer pesticides and herbicides precisely *because* they can use more effective ones.  &gt;Also, I would argue that record corn yields is actually a bit of a curse.   You're really saying that our record corn yields are a curse? I'm sure that you feel comfortable saying that, typing your comment from one of your god-knows-how-many internet-connected devices while people all around the world starve.  &gt;The links between HFCS and obesity seem to be pretty clear.   Oh, [really](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup#Health)?   &gt;I don't think humans are supposed to be consuming corn at the rate the average american does.  Can you explain how HCFS has anything to do with corn consumption, aside from the fact that HCFS is often refined from corn? Do you also think that we drink too much ocean water or eat too many rocks because people eat too much salt? Better yet, find a solution from which NaCl precipitates--do you think we have too much of that?  ∇",™

t5_2ssp3,yodatsracist,1370765909,"It's also worth noting that the *Great Gatsby* wasn't considered ""the Great American Novel ^® "" until World War Two at the earliest, not when it was initially published in 1925. As [this article](http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_23210783/from-good-sales-great-wartime-boosted-gatsby) states:  &gt;Published in 1925, the book was considered more of a ""nostalgic period piece,"" something like an old Gershwin tune, as one critic put it. In 1937, Fitzgerald couldn't even find his own novel on the shelves, going from bookstore to bookstore to find a copy for his mistress, Sheilah Graham. Sometime over the next decade, that all changed.  What changed?  Well, for one, Fitzgerald died in 1940, but the [New York Times obituary said](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0924.html), rather famously, ""The promise of his brilliant career was never fulfilled."" (It did, however, also call him a ""symbol of the 'jazz era'"" and recognize *Gatsby* as his best work.)  Between 1925 and 1942, only 25,000 copies of Gatsby were printed.  In 1942, however, the ""Council on Books in Wartime"" started printing cheap paperbacks to boost soldiers' morale.  Among the 122 million paperbacks they distributed were 150,000 copies of the ""Armed Services Edition"" of *the Great Gatsby*.  Pretty much everything I've read coming out in the wake of the new movie says that this wartime and post-War reevaluation, rather than any initial critical acclaim and recognition, is what sealed the book's eternal glory. Which is to say, Fitzgerald wasn't universally recognized as *the* voice of his generation until his generation had passed.",®

t5_2qhbe,lynn,1370771821,"We're doing a lot better now -- my husband got an internship last summer that became a Real Job™ -- but before he got hired, we were thinking of how much we could save to get us through the following school year. I'm really glad we didn't have to, because I did not have the financial skills to save very much at all.   We planned our first, but we didn't plan well enough.  I think a lot of the problem is that there is no personal finance course in most (any?) American public schools. IMO *every* high school should have one and it should be mandatory at about sophomore or junior year -- about the time people are able to get their first job, so they can put it into action right away but aren't already used to having spending money. Because if it's not in the schools then you have to learn from somebody you know, and if you don't know anybody who really cares about personal finance and saving etc, then you're basically SOL.  Nobody taught me or my brother how to budget (Mom felt that kids should be kids -- you can bet mine aren't being raised with that philosophy!), and it was only last January at age 33 that I finally put together a budget I can stick to, at least mostly. It didn't matter at the time I described, because we simply didn't have enough money to spend, but it definitely does now, and it definitely mattered at earlier points in my life. ",™

However, if I were still sitting on a Nexus S now I would be tempted to sit on it until the late 2013 Nexus phone is out, Android 4.2 isn't that different to 4.1, and I presume there are a whole host of ROMs for the Nexus S if you are into that kind of thing.

t5_2s7k2,SurfingTheCosmos,1370795791,"&gt;No, the whole point of bringing up Christianity is to disprove the false claim that Islam is uniquely violent.  Did you even read what I wrote? I said that **even when people aren't being one-sided**, Islam-fellating ex-Christians shove Christianity in the discussion in an attempt to downplay Islam's negative aspects. It seems they like defending Islam because it's curently Christianity's adversary #1 and they just love fellating anything against Christianity. *They're* the ones who have double standards.  &gt;it's critically important to bring up Christianity so that you can verify whether the person is being honest in their criticisms of Islam  No, it's utterly unnecessary when the topic of discussion is Islam. If the person is making factual, valid criticisms of Islam then it doesn't matter if he thinks Christianity's evil parts are equal to Islam's evil parts or not. How many times do you discuss [the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qaynuqa) or [the Massacre of Banu Qurayza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qurayza) when you're discussing the Crusades? How many times do you shove Islam's negative aspects in a discussion about Christianity? Why would you need to shove Islam in a such discussion? If you interpret any mention of Islamic violence as as a negation of Christian violence then the problem lies with **you**. If you aren't sated until the Bible is bashed in a discussion about the Quran then again the problem lies with **you**.  &gt;If someone is willing to gloss over Christian violence but interprets any violence committed by Muslims as driven purely by religion, then that is a problem.  No shit.  &gt;Also, what the fuck is ""Islam-fellating""? Would you like it if I called you ""Christianity-fellating"" for your refusal to engage in honest criticism of Christianity? Grow up.  PUH-LEEZ. A person who used an unnecessary expletive himself in a sentence is telling me to grow up. Stop pretending as if you're SO much more mature than me. You think I'm refusing ""to engage in honest criticism of Christianity"" just by not agreeing with you. You're clearly butthurt about Christianity, even more than I'm butthurt about Islam. Why do you seem personally offended by me calling people who are overly sympathetic to Islam ""Islam-fellaters""? Do you think deep down you're an Islam-fellater too?  &gt; Second, if you're referring to reddit's userbase as being sympathetic to Islam, that's horseshit.  Yeah right. Ask anyone on this subreddit and they'll have many examples where Reddit is treating Islam like the most sacrosanct thing in the world. I've seen this so many times: X makes a factual criticism of Islam, moron Y (usually a Muslim) comes up and says X is lying and that actually Islam says so and so. Y basically lies to everyone and get's frenziedly upvoted while X gets downvoted to oblivion. You might not have noticed how sympathetic Reddit is to Islam because you aren't as concerned about Islam as we are.  &gt;You mean, a right that people have basically always had and there is no necessity in ""defending"" it?  If your right can be defended by making comments on reddit, that's right probably can survive without your defense.  You misunderstood what I meant. Perhaps I should have phrased it better. What I meant was that I won't defend people who make up lies about Islam to make it look bad however I am going to defend people who make honest criticisms of Islam without criticsing Christianity too. I am going to speak out in their favour, even if that means commenting on Reddit.  &gt;Should people have the right to make invalid criticisms of Islam?  No.  &gt;Actually, no we don't. There are plenty of people that deny that the Crusades were A Bad Thing™.  Okay, but there's no point of mentioning those things in a discussion about Islam. If someone wants to enlighten people about the atrocities of the Christianity then they should have a separate discussion about it. Just like the people-who deny-that-the-Crusades-were-a-bad-thing piss you off, the people who deny Islam is a bad thing piss us off. Wouldn't you be angry at a person who diverts all the attention away from your discussion about the Crusades to a discussion about Muhammad's caravan raids?  &gt;Again, you're conflating criticism of Islam with Islamophobia.   I don't understand how I'm doing that. My point was that people (AKA libtards)  assume *we ex-Muslims are* anti-Muslim Islamophobes simply for calling out Islam on it's misogyny, homophobia, batshit crazy laws, etc.  &gt;Let's say someone says ""I don't want my children to go to the same school as Muslim children"". Is that ""criticism of Islam""? No, it's Islamophobia. That is what is being opposed here... xenophobia.  Duh. What does this have to do with what I said?",™

The best thing is obviously to go to the post office and ask what the cheapest option is but basically the main idea is that the weight is much more important than the size of the box if you want to cut costs.  Go to the [USPS Price Calculator](http://postcalc.usps.com).  If you now click on ""Package"" at ""-OR- Select Shape"" you can enter the weight. Anything under 4 pounds costs ~25$.   On the next screen select: ""Priority Mail® International Options"" I don't know which box will fit the best. Either one of those Flat Rate boxes, maybe ""Priority Mail® International"" or even the one in ""First-Class International Options"". If the shoes don't really fit inside one of those boxes you could send them without the shoe box and the person receiving them can get a new box or put them in another if it's okay with him. Wrapping them in some paper or a bag is gonna be enough protection.  AFAIK each option has tracking, but I could be mistaken.",®

The adoption of GR systems in canola, maize, cotton, soybean and sugar beets has been widespread in the United States. However, weed scientists are concerned that growers' current herbicide programs and weed management tactics will affect their sustainability and effectiveness. Without proper management, the potential for weed populations to express a high degree of resistance to glyphosate will adversely impact the utility of glyphosate. In 2005, weed scientists from six universities initiated a long-term research study to assess the sustainability of GR technology. This paper introduces five other articles in this series. Over 150 fields of at least 10 ha were selected to participate in a long-term field-scale study, and each field was split in half. On one-half the grower continued using the current weed management program; on the other half the grower used academic-recommended herbicide resistance best management practices. Field data were collected in 2006–2008 to determine the impact of the two weed management programs on weed populations, diversity, seedbank, crop yields and economic returns. This long-term study will provide invaluable data for determining the sustainability and profitability of diversified weed management programs designed to lower the risk of evolving weed resistance to glyphosate.

t5_2t5iz,1139,1370816105,"Okay. Hold up there. Let's talk this through. No need to shoot me now. Would you like a drink? Sit down and let's chat.  Now, it seems like this is a... complicated situation. Lots of mixed messages floating around. Like how I'm some sort of criminal in the future, or something. Couldn't we just work this out? I don't want to be a criminal, and I know that you don't want to kill anyone.  Well, that does look like an official paper indeed. And if that were so, I would happily comply with my execution. But how can I be sure that you are who you say you are? What kind of time police would send my *own grandson* to execute me?  Oh, you don't know? But it's obvious. You've got my mother's eyes, and a birthmark on the back of your neck shaped like a cockatrice, which is passed down through our male lineage. You mentioned the year you came from, and simple math leads to that conclusion.  Well there *is*. There's a big problem with that. See, if you kill me, your grandfather, then I will never pass on that cockatrice and you will never have been born. And if you were never born, then you never went back in time and killed me. And if that never happened, then I never died, and I can still have children. But if I have children, that means that you can now exist again. But it also means that you existed to go back in time and kill me. It's called a paradox, and it could destroy the universe. Do you want that?  Ah, yes, I figured you would have a record of when your father was conceived. Kill me after that and your timeline is preserved. Without me, of course. Five days ago, you say? That's an awfully small thing to be hinging the fate of the universe on. I mean, all future me would have to do is, say, send a message back to his past self warning him to delay it by a week. He sends his regards by the way.   You like my containment chair? It's specially made, from the future. I've been in communication with my future self for weeks now, and I know you're not allowed to cause a paradox, but I had to be sure. I'm going to rule the world in 40 years, and I can't have anyone mess that up.  Kill you? Why would I want to kill *you*? My own flesh and blood? I had you inserted into the time police for bigger reasons. I wouldn't just *kill* you. No, I'm going to train you. I got special equipment from the future, and without the government looking for its energy signature, I am free to use it to groom you as my successor. We'll have to remove those pesky memories first, they'll only get in the way. Then we can-  You... You shot me.  My own flesh and blood. My grandson. You shot me.  The paradoxes-AAAAARGH!

We aren't really in a strong position to lose him either, but I think we find a way to grab another solid goalie on the market.  He had his chance to rebound from an awful last year and failed (miserably).  (2)   Bylsma is given another chance  * Malkin, Letang, Dupuis, Murray and Adams are re-signed * Morrow and Cooke are gone * We do not attempt to re-sign Iginla and Fleury is given another shot in net.   * We sign some player in August like Eric Nystrom or Max Lapierre that will bring more grit to the lineup, says some Pittsburgh beat writer  Basically, it comes down to whether Mario pushes Shero so much to shake this team's identity up, losing the ""keep it light"" attitude by getting rid of players like TK, Fleury, and Cooke.  I really liked Matt Cooke on this team, and I think he plays hard, but I believe that next year his play will drop off and he will bring more of a distraction than he is worth.

t5_2tzlb,strokey,1370837228,"Lol no just no. Division of labor is not natural occurring its a social construct.  &gt;Of course not. You keeping me from sustaining my life is an act of physical violence. You are claiming the right to regulate my digestive system and bodily functions, which is clearly a violatio of the Non-Aggression Principle.   So if I own all the land around you, and forbid hunting, gardening etc on my land how will you eat? What if I forbid travel through my land, are you going to force me AT GUNPOINT!!!!@!@! to allow you the right to leave? What if my community owns all the land around the area since we're evil collectivist and decide we don't want someone who doesn't work with others eating? Are we forcing you to work so you can survive? Are we violating your freedoms!?  &gt;Not true. If I want to leave the United States, I am required to go to a building called an embassy, give them my biological information, a photo, sign my name, give them every identification number known to man, the names of my parents, where I live, where I work, and other personal information. Then I have to pay them a fee of their own choosing, which I think right now is 100-ish dollars. Then I have to wait 6 weeks for them to deliver me a little book called a ""Passport""... and once I have this passport, I can go to the border or to an airport and fly anywhere, right? Nope. There are some countries that will allow people with American passports to fly to them without visas, but many other countries will require that you give their embassies all this information, where you are going, why you are visiting, who you are staying with, etc. and even then, they only let you stay for a fixed amount of time, and if you overstay that time, they will forcibly remove you and send you back home at your own expense... that is after they imprison you and interrogate you and whatever else.  &gt;So this idea that I am free to leave at any moment is rather simplistic and not completely true. If I refuse to get this passport, guess what? I will not be allowed to leave the borders of the United States of America.   not true, you just don't have the balls to go it solo. You could renounce citizenship and go solo at any time but you won't because that would be hard. Come on oh Captain of Industry show us how stateless people can succeed, be the first data point to show your ideology is the true way!(Hint: there's a couple of states with failing governments that if they saw a huge influx of people could have the opinion turned and you could set millions free!)  &gt;You are referring to fascism,   I was not, I was referring to the fact that businesses like a stable economic climate generated by states, which is why businesses are typically involved in setting up states. See history of the US, most of Europe and parts of Asia for selected reading on the topic.   &gt;Just because a lot of people believe it, does not make it the objective truth. Government can't be efficient because it does not have a profit motive. It simply steals and inflates to fund itself, and does not deal with market forces.  Oh goody talking points. You know how evolution works? Well efficient is subjective, as is truth. There is no objective truth, even time and space is relative. Truth is, governments are effective in their jobs so well in fact that everybody on Earth now lives under one. Can you point to inefficiencies? Sure you can, but I can point to you efficiencies where private businesses fail.  &gt;Small wars were fought before government,   Yes and they were constant in higher population areas since they were fighting over resources. You know what stopped this? Sharing, collectivism (oh shudder the thought!). Some people had to be forced to share, and what happened? The Human race flourished under a system of social control. We are social creatures, we set rules for social actions every time we speak with another human being, what makes you think government won't raise up again? Happy thoughts and jerking off to Ayn Rand won't stop the truth, we crave social control, you can say you don't but that's bullshit, you want me to be Free™ but only under your subjective but objective(lol) morality code! This is the perfect example.  &gt;mmmkay.   I'd take you more seriously if you didn't argue economics before genocide as a reason for freedom.",™

t5_2qh33,CitizenFord,1370837641,"Think about this for a second. This person was out at the store and saw an innocent candle with a fire on the label when a meme popped into his head. This person most likely chuckled to himself and for most of us this is where it would end, but not for him. Later that night, trying to fall asleep, the meme continued to pester him, the words ""ain't nobody got time for that"" echoing within the vacant walls of his skull. He knew he wouldn't be able to find peace until this perfect joke was shared with the world. He tossed the blankets off himself, motivated to be free of the burden of this joke he was being forced to keep, and of which it was his duty to set free. He creeped past his parent's room into the office to do the deed. Working silently on the computer, he had no problem finding the exact image he was looking for, and pasted it into a Word document juxtaposed to the clever phrase that was the icing on his devil's food cake. It was then that he remembered his parents only had a black and white printer and considered calling the whole thing off, but knew he couldn't. It would have to do. After some nimble handiwork with his Crayola™ scissors, he grabbed the glue stick from the top drawer he had been required to have for Mrs. Burk's class last year but never used, and set them out on the nightstand satisfied with his night's work. As he closed his eyes, drifting to sleep, he could hear the laughter of the world, perched on the brink of eruption, awaiting his grand finale.   No sooner was he awake than he was out the door with the glue stick stuffed in his pocket and the two pieces of paper sandwiched in his favorite Animorphs book. The store was a short walk away and he revelled in every step. It was the weekend, the store was busy, and he knew he would have to be alert to the possibility of tattlers. Making his way to the back of the store, he kept his eyes down so as not to draw attention to himself, trying to be inconspicuous with the glue stick bulging from his pants pocket. Turning down the aisle, he saw the coast was clear and made a bee-line route to the candle. There he removed the papers from the book and deftly applied the glue to them and adhered them to the candle and placed it back on the shelf in a matter of seconds, checking the aisle ends to make sure nobody saw. This was the stuff dreams are made of. Taking a step back to admire his work, he knew all that was left to do was to take a picture and his masterpiece would be complete. There he stood, his hand slowly removing his phone from his pocket, a grin stretched across his face. The world was his.",™

t5_2qm4e,brownMandMs,1370837890,"Thanks for asking. I learned something new. The glutaraldehyde can get a head start in the photosynthetic cycle by entering as an intermediate. From one fertilizer site:   &gt;The reason plants need CO2 is to produce longer chain carbon compounds also known as photosynthetic intermediates. Photosynthetic intermediates includes compounds such as ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, and 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5 bisphosphate. Although the names are complicated, the structures are quite simple (5 carbon chains). Flourish Excel™ does not contain these specific compounds per se, but one that is quite similar. By dosing with Flourish Excel™ you bypass the involvement of CO2 and introduce the already finished, structurally similar compounds. It is in its structural similarity that Flourish Excel™ is able to be utilized in the carbon chain building process of photosynthesis. Simple chemical or enzymatic steps can easily convert it to any one to any one of the above named compounds (or a variety of others).",™

Some of our founding fathers said that about a federal army, that it would invite tyranny, and preferred keeping it broken up into local militias.

On Intel x86 processors, the execution time of integer and floating point division and SIMD square root does depend on the magnitude of the input:  &gt; 9 . The latency and throughput of IDIV in Enhanced Intel Core microarchitecture varies with operand  sizes and with the number of significant digits of the quotient of the division. If the quotient is zero,  the minimum latency can be 13 cycles, and the minimum throughput can be 5 cycles. Latency and  throughput of IDIV increases with the number of significant digit of the quotient. The latency and  throughput of IDIV with 64-bit operand are significantly slower than those with 32-bit operand.  Latency of DIV is similar to IDIV. Generally, the latency of DIV may be one cycle less.  &gt; 10 . The latency and throughput of IDIV in Intel Core microarchitecture varies with the number of  significant digits of the quotient of the division. Latency and throughput of IDIV may increases with  the number of significant digit of the quotient. The latency and throughput of IDIV with 64-bit  operand are significantly slower than those with 32-bit operand.  &gt; 11 . The latency of DIV r64 varies. If the dividend (RDX:RAX) is no more than 64-bits, the latency is  similar to DIV r32. If the dividend is more than 64-bits, the latency is in the neighborhood of 70  cycles or more.  [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual, Appendix C](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf)  Of course, division is *not* going to dominate the runtime of either the client or the server and the variance in division speed isn't all that large.

For my own I have never left out God of the equation. Even though I was an agnostic between 1955-1987 this didn't imply that I didn't believe in Jesus, I had not reason to not. When I was 13 I refused to do ""confirmation"" and told the priest that I am not mature for this, and she was happy for my decision. I speculated that Jesus was a helping visitor from a high-tech civilization and so far has not got any indications against this. During the 80-ies I started pondering over the reason for the world, and I still do. I was an agnostic until 1987 when I had a revelation. This revelation could from one aspect be seen as generated by high tech, like the scenario in e.g. Exodus, but due to also a neurophysiological component in this revelation I had no way to imagine such a high tech technology that such an input could come from the ""outside"", thus it had to come from the inside, and thus being a proof for the world to be ""fake"". So from that event, which only lasted around 3 minutes, I had got a significant indication for this world to be just a simulation or a game scenario. I also got an important message, which I didn't understand until spring 2009. After that event 1987 I had understood what needed to be done with the world, to fix it, work which e.g. Richard Stallman had started just before (Free Software Foundation), I wrote a report to finish an old school course describing the technical and social evolution from 1987 to 2037, and then decided to start my PhD program to obtain the skills and tools I needed for this.   Regarding:  &gt; I still don't fully understand how that applies to Jesus, but alright.  Jesus is presented in very many forms from a miracle maker (Wine, Bread, Fishes, curing lepra, blindness etc and even able to exit and enter the Matrix again (resurrection) (requiring either extreme high tech as well as medical knowledge or connection with the underlying implementation, the ""source"")  to someone very insightful but neither divine nor a miracle maker in other scriptures.  For me it doesn't really matter what. The message he gave as  *""Do unto others as you want others do unto you""* or in the extended version *""treat others as they want/need to be treated""* or in another wording *""Love your neighbor as yourself""*.  is sufficient to tell me that he had got the true insight. Most of the things Jesus said are neither contradictive either, but occasionally he seems confused, sometimes claiming to be God and sometimes being a messenger. If this is intentional or just the results of human interpretations I do not know and I think it is not important.  I am quite amazed how the world is going to such extreme expressions as today (e.g. wars like the insane attack on Iraq, and war on information DMCA, copyright, DRM, patents, proprietary tech etc) as well as attempts to kill what is of uttermost importance for a society, i.e. personal integrety, like the NSA-google,microsoft,yahoo,facebook etc scandal which has recently been revealed.   News about the world started to become so insane a few years ago, merely a kind of massive ""proof"" for this world to be just a kind of practical joke, which resulted in me stopping reading news spring 2011, as they were just like comedy. Now news are filtered through my friends.  Anyway, how my previous message about Bayesian statistics and close-minded ness and Jesus is related is that there seem to be different people.  People that consider that what happens is by random, they believe what other people are saying and despite this do not do anything, they are just waiting for some kind of Messiah. That is insane!  For me, there are no ""random events"", almost everything I experience seems to have a well motivated meaning, and I'm just amazed how most other people (I know a few though) which do not see this. So in summary:  If one can see that the world is weird, Fix it, be your Messiah, don't wait for someone else to save you❣  Jesus said that he will return like *""a thief in the night""*. However, as there are so many things going on now, when lots of actors try to act like a Messiah, but... in very strange ways (like google/NSA etc) it is hard to see on ""which side"" they are. Which ones are Jesus and which ones are just thieves...  One thing is clear, I have to focus❣   However, I still do not know the reason for the world. In the 80-ies I considered that it could be a school or a test, but lately it seems to be more of a stupid computer game, but they can of course all be true. One thing is clear, any mind can not be alone, any mind which becomes self aware needs a world to interact with. As I indicated with the last reference to one of my essays in the previous message, that is [""My Free Will is not Free, it is Reinforced Logic""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=98).",❣

t5_2tzlb,thisdecadesucks,1370871640,"&gt;So if I own all the land around you, and forbid hunting, gardening etc on my land how will you eat?    What a bizarre and unlikely scenario.  If you were to somehow completely circle me and try to trap me inside some land parcel and refuse to let me eat, then I think I would have to trespass on your property, kick your ass, and start hunting.... This is such a desert island scenario that ignores principles, would probably never happen, and neither proves nor disproves anything relating to the ideas I have presented.    &gt;What if my community owns all the land around the area since we're evil collectivist and decide we don't want someone who doesn't work with others eating? Are we forcing you to work so you can survive? Are we violating your freedoms!?  In this scenario, you would be the one not willing to work with others, as you are trying to starve me into submission.  You would be trying to enslave me, which is a violation of my rights.  &gt;not true, you just don't have the balls to go it solo. You could renounce citizenship and go solo at any time but you won't because that would be hard.  If only you knew where I have travelled and lived in the world.  Your assumptions about me are giggle-worthy in their ignorance.  &gt;governments are effective in their jobs so well in fact that everybody on Earth now lives under one.  Being effective at plunder and mass violation of rights coupled with the occasional (or frequent) rape, murder, and extortion racket does not make it right.  Just because gangs of thieves currently have most of the land under their control does not mean it is morally correct.    &gt;Can you point to inefficiencies? Sure you can, but I can point to you efficiencies where private businesses fail.  This is a great point because it shows you the nature of government.  If a government runs out of money, what do they do?  They steal more from people at the point of gun, or they get their central bank to print up a bunch of fake money called a ""treasury bond"" and they continue to pursue their destructive goals.  What does a business do when it runs out of money?  They go out of business, and a better business with happier customers will come in and take their place.  Thanks for making my point for me.  &gt;what makes you think government won't raise up again?   If people understood their rights, and understood the true nature of government, people would simply stop paying taxes, stop voting, and stop paying attention to bureaucrats.  If nobody shows up to an election, and nobody reports their taxes to the government, what happens?  They will either declare war on their own people and show the violence inherent in the system, or they will simply collapse in their own footprint.  If the worst-case-scenario is a return to the current system, then I will gladly take that chance.    &gt;Happy thoughts and jerking off to Ayn Rand won't stop the truth, we crave social control, you can say you don't but that's bullshit, you want me to be Free™ but only under your subjective but objective(lol) morality code!   Ayn Rand was a statist, and I do not follow or read her works as part of my studies, so you can let that one go.  I am sorry you crave domination over your fellow man, but that does not legitimize it.  I want to be free under my own morality code, and I want you and your friends to live under your own morality code, so long as your morals do not interfere with my inherent right to self-ownership.  &gt;I'd take you more seriously if you didn't argue economics before genocide as a reason for freedom.  I honestly don't understand what you are talking about in this sentence.",™

More often than not it's used by the ""friendzoned,"" person as a criticism or attack against the ""friendzoner."" And in my experience, men are FAR more likely to use this term than women, again, specifically to attack and criticize women who just aren't interested in them. This happens especially in conjunction with ""The Nice Guy™,"" often manifesting itself, from what I've seen, where a ""Nice Guy™,"" does absolutely nothing to make his intentions known, and when the woman finds a boyfriend, the ""Nice Guy™,"" then goes on the internet and whines about how he got ""friendzoned,"" even though he never actually put himself out there as legitimate romantic option. He then becomes bitter and hateful towards the woman and blames her for treating him like the friend he always was. The ""Nice Guy™,"" then will rant to the internet about how ""nice,"" he is and how there's something inherently ""wrong,"" with women that they aren't attracted to ""Nice Guys™,"" like him.  So yeah.   **TL;DR: I don't think that the term ""friendzone,"" is inherently misogynist, but it's often used by misogynists who want to criticize women for not being interested in them.**",™

t5_2qh6c,cabbagery,1370879367,"First, that doesn't follow. Lucifer evidently had the 'free will' to rebel, in spite of the fact that he apparently *observed* god create the universe. Adam and Eve didn't even know the difference between good and evil, yet they had direct access to god (i.e. irrefutable evidence of god's existence), and they, too, were apparently able to rebel against god. If the bible is accurate *at all*, then throughout its many pages, *every person who has been given direct and irrefutable evidence of god's existence has managed to rebel*. Hell, the idiot Hebrews at Sinai had only just observed as Yahweh orchestrated their escape from Egypt, yet even while Moses was crafting the stone tablets at the mountain's top, they were able to rebel by building a golden calf (which they proceeded to worship).  So unless you deny virtually *all* of the bible, you cannot say that god ""should not reveal himself to us,"" because throughout the bible, *that's precisely what he does*.  And what of those who *didn't* [continue to] rebel, in spite of receiving direct and irrefutable evidence of god's existence? What of Paul, the Twelve, various prophets, virtually anyone who had direct contact with Jesus (especially those who witnessed miracles)? Are you suggesting that god *shouldn't* have done these things, or that because these people in some meaningful way had their 'free will' robbed, they are therefore ineligible for an eternal reward?  No. You are not prepared to say that at all.  Second, the 'free will' type of defense is impotent anyway. It suggests that god, in its omniscience, 'chose' (whatever that means -- it is unclear that an omniscient and morally perfect being has any 'free will' of its *own*) to create in such a way that 'free will' is particularly important, but because of the constraint imposed by your premise, the vast majority of its creation would endure an awful eternal fate (or at least miss out on the eternal reward), which we are told runs counter to god's actual wishes.  Never mind that omnipotent beings get what they want, and omniscient beings know what they'll get -- insofar as it may be the case that we are without excuse for our rebellion, god is also without excuse for creating in such a way that the vast majority of us would rebel.  Consider an analogy:  &gt; A parent erects a large table in a room, around which she places several toy guns. Ray guns, cap guns, Nerf® blasters, etc. all ring the edge of the table. None of these is in any meaningful way actually dangerous. At the center of the table, this parent places a real, loaded, and unsafed .44 magnum (if you like, we may also say she places a magical life-giving elixir next to it).  &gt; After all of this, our parent gives her two young children access to the room, and informs them that they may play with all of the toy guns which line the table, but that they may not play with the one in the center, else it will kill them. The parent then leaves the room, locks the door, and observes the room from behind a two-way mirror.  Now, as you may or may not have guessed, this tale is directly analogous to the situation in Eden -- except that in Eden there was also a creature who sought to tempt the 'children' into playing with the real gun. Insofar as we (collectively) are evidently guilty of disobeying the parent by picking up the real gun and shooting ourselves, surely any such parent is likewise culpable. Surely any parent who did this would rightly be found to be at minimum criminally negligent, and surely we'd not deign to lift up such a parent as some sort of moral paragon.  Yet Yahweh, as the story goes, did all of this and worse. As I noted, Yahweh also placed an *agent provocateur* into the room, and according to Christian theology, Yahweh *knew* what the outcome would be, *but did it anyway*. That is not the mark of a morally perfect being, but the mark of a monster.  ---  Yeah, so no. 'Free will' cannot be what the 'free will' defense requires it to be. There have been myriad examples of persons throughout the bible and the history of the Christian tradition who have been 'robbed' of their ""free will *not to believe*, who according to that tradition have not suffered any negative consequences as a result. The 'free will' defense also implicates god, else exposes god as incompetent.",®

t5_2qh5b,Slothwithbroth,1370885034,"What I meant by begs the question is that the cosmological argument presupposes with its use of the PSR that infinite regress is not an option. I.e.

But it just may be that there necessarily isn't a first cause, as some cultures believe.  Sorry for my previous clarity issues.   As well, as I said before - I don't remember the ontological argument and I didn't plan on laying out each entire argument. But I do remember that the ontological argument uses reductio ad absurdum fallaciously as I learned in a Philosophy course. It had something to do with the argument saying ""therefore there must be a greater, greatest superior being,"" which doesn't make sense. But I don't remember as I said before.   Also I think my responses to the teleological and cosmological arguments are okay, as I wrote a paper on the Cosmo. And it's dependency on the teleo.

""Really the best thing about the smirk is that it demonstrates that literally a single pixel can serve as shipping fuel. It was worth it for that scientific demonstration alone."" —Andrew Hussie, on this panel of Homestuck Shipping Goggles is when a viewer interprets the smallest, most ambiguous canonical evidence in favor of their ship of choice, even if said ""evidence"" is insignificant relative to other evidence, or outright nonexistent. Maybe that glance lasted just a little too long, or that remark in that conversation could be interpreted as innuendo. The ship in question can range from one that seems entirely plausible but doesn't yet have clear canon evidence, right up to a Crack Pairing between characters who are bitter enemies, live in different universes, have never met, or whose sexuality or circumstances makes any relationship between them extremely unlikely. Reasons for putting on Shipping Goggles vary; sometimes it's just wishful thinking, sometimes it's to defend the ship against other competing ships, and sometimes it's Just for Fun. Merely being an implausible pairing doesn't automatically mean that Shipping Goggles are in play however, as often a ship's supporters will admit that their support for a particular pairing has nothing to do with the source material. Note that as with everything Tropes Are Tools, although this can be bad in some situations. Many shippers would admit to doing this to some extent; in fact, having your own interpretation of Canon is part of the fun of Shipping. However, it can become Fan Dumb when people try to force their ships on others. Not to mention what happens when such fans are Running the Asylum... A subtrope of Epileptic Trees. Creators aware of their fans' Shipping Goggles can play to it with a Ship Tease; this can be interpreted as Fanservice or just cruelty in suggesting a relationship that isn't going to materialize. Sometimes, the shipper turns out to be right. Other times... Caution should be used not to confuse every case of Fan Yay Gaydar as Shipping Goggles — if fans believe a character is gay, it is not necessarily because fans want to ship them them. Examples should generally go on one of the other Shipping Tropes pages, like Crack Pairing — particularly dubious interpretations may be listed here though.

Remember when Wikileaks offered the United States government to redact the cables, and the response was to pressure Visa to cut off donations to Wikileaks, which subsequently began its downfall and the eventual unredacted leak? Now that was **bravery**.  Manning is not a hero, he leaked all the cables and should have redacted the cables himself, since a transgendered living/working under a DADT policy isn't already under enough mental duress.

t5_2cneq,Sir_Auron,1370894986,"Any rational person who thinks about what libertarianism (not the Libertarian Party™ but the broad idea itself) means for the military, for the social safety net, and for the federal budget should realize that it is a process and any implementation at all would be incredibly gradual. The current government behemoth wasn't created overnight, and it won't be broken up overnight.  More than anything, I agree with the way libertarians (again, small 'l') think about government. That's how I think about government: cost/benefit analysis, an accounting of every dollar before it's spent, long-term planning, and the utmost concern for civil liberties and property rights (not all of which are created equal). Where we begin to diverge is in our respective opinions after those analyses.   I truly believe that the collectivism that brings about our corrupt, corporatist government really is inferior to the mindset I described above. ""Fix education no matter what it costs."" ""Fix the hurricane damage no matter what it costs."" ""Keep me safe no matter what it costs."" It's not [just] the money that's wrong with those statements, it's the complete lack of foresight they betray.  So no, I don't necessarily want a Libertarian president. What I do want, as an average person who overthinks this type of thing, is for more people to ask ""Should the government do this?"" (oftentimes the answer will be yes, remember) instead of ""Can the government do this?"" (where the answer from the authoritatians that run the dog and pony show will always, always be yes).",™

Some “Color Runners”  opt to wear glasses or goggles for their eyes and use a bandana or dust mask for their mouths.

t5_2to85,Sixelona,1370913741,"In my opinion it got too big. There's people on the server that I have never met or they never said hi to me. It's not as close knit as it was before.  When it was a smaller sized group it was easier to meet people, make friends,  coordinate events. We had an amazing Halloween party where even mindcrackers showed up and everyone had all kinds of fun. Now having those events are hard to do. People lose interest.  We have to start new worlds because people would take resources from near town and there was next to nothing to gather within 3000 blocks. RC and I ended up going 7-10k blocks out to find unclaimed land.  I never got the 'hierarchy' thing. Then again sadly I wasn't on as much as I wish. But for those who think people just 'took over' that is not the case. Some people spent hours, days of their time creating plots, building a town square, making the server feel welcoming when you joined. We didn't want people to immediately run off into the nether and we never saw them again. But ultimately this is what tended to happen.  In my opinion there are plenty of servers that dont coordinate events and you can go as far as you want. The MCFS was about community, doing things together, and some people just didn't want that and instead think there was some ultimate plan to ruin people's fun. I'd also like to note that no one was ever forced to participate in events nor did they have to help with building.  I've been with MCFS almost since opening. I met Darkphan, Morgwen, and some really great people thanks to this server. But lately I've been almost hesitant to go on, knowing that I missed my chance to venture and find an unexplored temple or a cave that hasn't already been plundered. I miss the events. I miss the close knit community.  And now I await the slew of down votes I'll receive for stating my view on the subject matter.  **EDIT** - I'm heading to bed. I'm sorry for any folks that I may have upset. For those commenting that I should join a smaller server, I actually have gone ahead with this :) I still love the MCFS but I'll be taking a break from it. Love ya guys, take care ♥ ♥ ♥",♥

That is why we are very excited to announce an all-new next generation Mirror’s Edge is in development. In this introductory blog post, Senior Producer Sara Jansson shares her personal thoughts on spearheading this new project.  &gt;Hi, my name is Sara Jansson, and I have the honor of working as Senior Producer for Mirror’s Edge.  &gt;Wow, it feels great to finally be able to type those words. Ever since we introduced the world to Mirror’s Edge in 2008, we have been waiting for the right moment to bring Faith back -- and we know you have been waiting as well. We’re taking Mirror’s Edge to a new era of entertainment delivering unique gameplay only possible today with our newly developed Frostbite engine and the arrival of the next generation platforms. You can get a glimpse of what I’m talking about in the official Mirror’s Edge E3 Teaser Trailer above.  &gt;Like so many fans I fell in love with the original Mirror’s Edge. I think it’s because it did things in a brave new way from the first-person parkour inspired movement in a vertical environment to the unique art direction; all of this based in at stark dystopian setting that still feels too close for comfort. But perhaps the strongest element in Mirror’s Edge is its iconic heroine, Faith. In 2008, I was one of the millions of fans who connected with Faith. Today, I feel privileged to be leading the charge on a new Mirror’s Edge featuring one of gaming’s most inspiring and true heroines.  &gt;So there you have it. The stake is in the ground, this new game will be a first-person action adventure starring Faith and I am here to tell you that we will stay true to Mirror’s Edge.  &gt;As we embark on this new adventure, I ask that you be patient as we explore the best way to make Faith’s return as memorable and impactful as the original game. We are still in early stages of development and we don’t want to rush anything. We want to make sure we create an experience that lives up to high expectations and fully takes advantage of the next generation of systems.  &gt;Finally, I want to extend a sincere thank you to all of our fans. Every time you have asked us about the future of Faith, we have felt your support. Without you, the new Mirror’s Edge wouldn’t be happening.  &gt;Sara Jansson Senior Producer, Mirror’s Edge DICE",™

I wish I could look at my factions with a better picture, but the majority of assholes really need to be brought down.    Mattherson:    ♦ Terran Republic: A lot of nice people, but I usually see a bunch more disrespectful people. Trolling, name calling, the such.   Outfit wise it's one of the most organized I have ever seen. Every time I see the TR outfits get on together and roll out on the same page they just DESTROY anything in their way. But, it only lasts for so long due to all the fighting wearing people down. So the TR has a spurt of wreckage, and it dies down to taking and losing territory.    ♦ Vanu: As far as I've seen. I've either met really respectful and kind people who aren't complete asshats. Or VERY egotistical players who think they and their faction are just the fucking shit for no real legit reason.   Outfit wise the Vanu have been doing a fantastic job in most cases. I personally like fighting TEST and GOKU as they like having fun with the fights. There have been some fights where the Vanu did an amazing job out maneuvering the TR and NC in some fights. But holy shit we get it you won the fight. Stop god damn gloating about it.   Hell the Vanu ghost capped the continents not too long ago and they have been parading around going ""WE OWN THIS SHIT WE WIN FUCK YOU!"" But everytime I engage them with the outfits they can't really do anything. I only see them win when they have more numbers. Which has been a common thing since Vanu on Mattherson have had a pretty high pop for awhile now. And if they actually won a even fight I personally haven't seen it yet.    ♦ New Conglomerate: I have only met poor sportsmanship players on the NC side. With a small chunk of exceptions. There is the occasional nice guy on the NC side of the world. But the vast majority like to troll, whisper insults, start stupid ass arguments, and t-bag corpses. A lot of disrespect.    Outfit wise I have no god damn idea what the NC are doing. They seem very unorganized and only really assemble then their warpgate is threatened. And there have been some outfits who like to park in front of a warpgate and kill any air coming through. Which I found baffling since we just fly around them and they can't do a damn thing. Or they just get wrecked by a tank column.    I'd like to have a more positive light on it all. But I meet far more negative people than I do positive.",♦

This means he can stay in lane longer than anyone if need be. He makes excellent use of Spirit Visage. 2. He's got a ranged poke that benefits nicely from AD and CDR. 3. He excels at split pushing. A stack of wards and clever use of his ultimate will let him push deep into enemy territory and get out alive to tell the tale. Ravenous Hydra doubles as a splitpush item and AA resetter, making it a valid item option. 4. His champ-specific item is incredibly cost efficient, think of it as a 800 gold B.F. Sword and boots wrapped up into one. 5. His burst is second-to-none at level two all-ins, and murders most squishies with ease later on in the game.

His whole thing is constant thought interruption, and reframing the debate back to Winstonvision™. And he has a very deep bag of these very practiced tricks. It is like boxing. No matter the weight, or truth behind your punches, you are always going to be too off balance to land a decent blow.  The best strategy seems to be to ignore him, and not get in the scrap in the first place, but his other trait is that of first class muckraker, so sooner or later you are going to have to defend yourself.

My inference was that you were saying all/most dudes who complain about the friendzone feel entitled, even if they won't say so. DS was saying that they've never seen someone with that attitude, period. 3) Come to think, why are you so sure that the other person's assessment of the complainant's attitude is correct?

t5_2s0u3,TheGamblur,1370958705,"&gt;For the second consecutive year, a key Bears defensive end has to overcome a nagging foot injury. &gt; &gt;Second-year pro Shea McClellin has plantar fasciitis in his right foot, according to a league source. He first started experiencing discomfort in February while working out, and it might have resulted from a lack of arch support in his shoes. &gt; &gt;McClellin has had full participation in offseason workouts and is not expected to be limited when the Bears begin a three-day mandatory minicamp Tuesday. His status could be worth monitoring throughout the season, though, considering how plantar fasciitis can linger. &gt; &gt;Julius Peppers experienced the same issues last season yet never missed a game and was named to his eighth Pro Bowl. The Bears monitored his reps during training camp to keep him fresh for the regular season. Peppers declined to acknowledge the injury, referring to it as ""general soreness.'' &gt; &gt;Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the thick band of tissue at the bottom of the foot. The condition rarely requires surgery and usually can be controlled with increased stretching, ice, shoe inserts and rest. &gt; &gt;McClellin underwent Astym treatment, according to the source. The treatment is a stimulation of the body's healing response, resulting in the remodeling of scar tissue and the regeneration of degenerated tendons. It is a non-invasive procedure and involves physical therapy with an acrylic stone. &gt; &gt;A variety of treatments, including cortisone shots, helped Bulls center Joakim Noah play at an All-Star level in the playoffs despite being noticeably hobbled by plantar fasciitis. &gt; &gt;""Plantar fasciitis sucks,'' Noah said in April. ""It feels like you have needles underneath your foot while you're playing. …You need to jump, you need to run, you need to do a lot of things while you're playing basketball, so you don't want needles underneath your foot, right? &gt; &gt;""It's not easy, but at the end of the day, you've got to do what you've got to do.'' &gt; &gt;All indications are McClellin's pain subsided over the last few months. The former first-round draft pick dealt with knee and concussion issues during his rookie season. When healthy, he showed flashes of his ability and quick first step. In 14 games, McClellin recorded 21/2 sacks and seven tackles. He played 365 snaps, which amounted to 34.7 percent of the defensive plays. &gt; &gt;General manager Phil Emery said McClellin might stand up at linebacker in certain situations but insisted he would not be moved to middle linebacker permanently. At least one member of the previous coaching staff believed the Bears planned to switch McClellin to middle linebacker in the future to replace Brian Urlacher. &gt; &gt;The Bears moved on without the now-retired Urlacher and signed D.J. Williams to a one-year deal as a stopgap. Second-round pick Jon Bostic could be the middle linebacker of the future. &gt; &gt;Whatever McClellin's role is, the pressure is on him to produce. The Bears gave up on one first-round pick Sunday when they traded Gabe Carimi to the Buccaneers. Emery is highly unlikely to give up on his initial Bears draftee. &gt; &gt;""The expectations are high for me this year, so hopefully I can fill all those expectations,'' McClellin said this offseason. ""I'm going to work hard and do my best.'' &gt; &gt;vxmcclure@tribune.com &gt; &gt;Twitter @vxmcclure23 &gt; &gt;Copyright © 2013 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC",©

Riddell's black-and-white drawings have an expressive, graphic-novel-style sophistication, but can't leaven this leaden effort. (Fiction. 11-13) -- Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

t5_2s7yn,FLXLF,1370963460,"hmm... maybe, but this title is probably marketed towards an audience who don't have the time, willingness or patience to go in-depth with a game. even if all of those concepts were adequately explained, do you think the F2P crowd will understand and embrace them? there is no point in including a great tutorial if no-one uses it.  obviously the idea of attracting more players is great. maybe some of them will get a taste of Tekken in a more approachable package, (which is also great!) but I can't help but think that somewhere along the road, a lot of those people will try a ""real"" (i.e. fully-featured) Tekken game, and will end up back at square one. maybe this is an experiment to see how many of the more obscure mechanics they can strip down while still keeping the Tekken feel, I don't know. I just think that if this ends up being vastly different from the ""core"" Tekken experience, it could lead to even more confusion. (""Why can't I do my Special Arts and Critical Arts? And where do I spend my Grinding Points™ to power up my characters? This is Tekken, right?"")  all in all, in my opinion this can go both ways. either new players hop aboard, and Namco decides on unifying mechanics and game features, or there will be an even larger disparity in skill levels than there is currently. for me, the core of Tekken is to understand the underlying mechanics and formulating strategies based around them - instead of relying on tricks, gimmicks, power ups, gems, invincible super moves, etc.  it's just (for the most part anyway) a very honest game, and I love that. what I don't love, however, is this new trend of using arbitrary features and mechanics to build bridges between gaps in skill that instead should be built by practicing.  sorry for the wall of text, I guess I have stronger feelings about this subject than I thought, heh. :D",™

t5_2qh03,tehrebound,1370971033,"The long answer is that sometimes ""standing pat"" is moving forward. When you get right down to it, there wasn't really anything NEW or INNOVATIVE that was coming out from the PS4. I mean hell, people were joking that the PS4 looked like two PS2 glued together, although let's be honest: no matter what the PS4 ended up looking like people would have made fun of it.  But...looking at the first conference for XB1, was there really anything being featured that you wanted/needed? As someone who plays video games, were you necessarily excited by being able to watch TV and movies on your XB1, or being able to Skype from it or listen to music on it, or all of the other non-gaming stuff they were showing off? At Sony's conference, they said PS4 could do all that too, but it wasn't a centerpiece of the presentation.  And even putting aside the DRM, the always online, the used games, and all the rest of that, when you looked at the titles coming out for XB1, were you excited? There were a LOT of sequels (to be expected), a LOT of sports games, and a LOT of shooters. Even that cartoony looking one, Sunset Overdrive, is a shooter. Don't get me wrong, I like shooters (played CS competitively, played Quake and CoD). But there was a lot of emphasis on realism, on grittiness and brown and bloom; so much so that it even infected Dead Rising 3, which was a zombie game series that had some of the BEST gallows humor ever.  Contrast that with what PS4 is going to be having on launch. If you include the non-exclusive stuff from the Ubisoft and EA presentation, you end up with a VERY WIDE variety of games. Final Fantasy XV. Kingdom Hearts 3 (♥). New Infamous. MAD MAX. Are there sports games and shooters on PS4? Yes, but Sony didn't make those a centerpiece of the presentation. And while I said to not talk about the DRM, it's worth noting that any game that isn't an XB1 exclusive, you can buy for PS4 and/or PC and not be DRM'd to death.  Also don't forget about the much, MUCH larger library of indie games getting their console release exclusively on PS4 (You can get Don't Starve on Steam IIRC). For Microsoft, indie development = Minecraft, an already well-established and wildly popular indie game. Notch himself even tweeted, ""Not sure if we're the type of indies that require support. They could do SO much more."" Sony not only said they had a larger indie library but they SHOWED IT OFF and made it a CENTRAL POINT of their presentation.  In the end, Sony did a lot of ""not Microsoft."" And that's why there's so much love. Standing pat, so to speak, and being about more than just sports and shooters can put you surprisingly ahead.",♥

Are you surprised software have bugs in them? Games are not special. People can find exploits in games just like any other software. There have been several winhacks/drophacks since SC2's release and they have all been patched relatively quickly (atleast after they were used publicly like this). Now there's apparently a new winhack out there and I'm sure Blizzard will go through the games played by this account and fix it soon™. You can't expect software to be perfect, there will always be some edge case that the developers have missed that can be exploited. SC2 is however a lot more secure now than it was 1 year ago. ",™

Congratulations on breaking free!    Be aware though that even though you've left the religion, the religion probably has not left you.  You're a born-in and have been marinating in their way of thinking your entire life.  It will likely take some time to shed the organizationally-created personality and discover your buried real self.  I myself was disfellowshipped but continued to believe it was still the ""truth"" for about 2 years.  It led to quite a few sleepless nights and a persistent feeling that I was unworthy and would be destroyed by God at Armageddon.  I don't want you to experience the same thing.   You MUST read ""Crisis of Conscience"" by Raymond Franz.  If you haven't heard the name, he was a Governing Body member for nine years.  He chronicles his life within the organization and the events that ultimately led to his departure.  It's an incredibly absorbing read; without a doubt the best book I've read in my life.

A brand to listen to music? What do you use ?  The fact that I hear a lot of  your scores from movies more often than I see the movies which the score are from should provide a crystal clear message :) You make the a lot of movies complete....  Giving them a deeper and a more amplified affect even more on the emotions caused by the movie.   *&gt;""Music is feelings floating""*© ;)  Please continue to write scores and composing ;)   Best and humble regards  Martin Annel ",©

t5_2qh1i,Breathe_the_Stardust,1370996149,"1/2 cup sherry 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/4 brown sugar Few garlic cloves Crushed red peppers to taste Chicken breast (pork chops) Olive oil Fettuccine noodles  Add oil to the pan and heat that shit up. No need to be the Human Flamer™, medium-high heat will do. Squeeze those chicken breast a little because why the fuck not, you haven't gotten any in a while (but this recipe will fix that). Throw those breast in the oil and cook for a bit. Quick! Get those hot little chicken titties out of that pan and add more oil. Sauté some garlic in that shit, but don't fucking burn it or you're definitely not getting any. Now add your sherry, soy sauce, and brown sugar and let that ambrosial mixture heat to a gentle boil, let the smell seep into your nostrils and try your hardest to hold back those urges to touch yourself. Go ahead, be a man and add a metric shit ton of crush red peppers; More spice is more nice. Replace the chicken into the sauce and reduce heat to simmer. Flip that chicken occasionally.   Serve chicken over your noodles covered in some extra sauce. What the fuck did you say? I didn't tell you to make noodles?! Fuck you, they were in the recipe list and any fucktard can make them. Just learn to time your shit right. And if you think this dish is complete without a green veggie side dish you are completely fucking wrong! Grow a pair and buy some fucking greens to make!   (I know it technically has more than 5 ingredients but I could soy sauce, garlic, and crushed red peppers as staples that are always in the house... Maybe the sugar too)",™

Please share and do not change ©   Full view:  Hello! On October 25th, 2012, the next messenger angel of God brought on this message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom, prophet of God! My name is Rouacha. I come to you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I reveal to you the following...  They want Israel to bow down and surrender to Islam. Islam is out on the massive destruction of Israel, as Israel isn't listening now.  Benjamin, you saw that Obama had an Arabic Bible in his drawer, do you remember? Under the desk... There are people replaced, who had to swear to make nothing public and to stand 100% behind Obama. Also Obama has the media under his control, completely! Someone from the White House had said to others, that Obama is the antichrist, and he told about his behavior. Shortly afterwards this man was deceased. As you know, Benjamin, Obama is playing a game and he has many personalities.  Iran is prepared for battle. Many spies have been arrested already.  The whole world does not even realize that Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is more than a conqueror! Even with God's holy Scriptures they have never been able to eradicate it. So it will be with Israel! The world has abandoned Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of God, the God of Isaac, Jacob and Abraham. Few stand behind Israel, and especially many countries don't even care about Israel. Why? The world hates Israel because of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.  The evil spirits hate Yeshua, Jesus, and have already started the war, and want the world to bow down to Obama and Islam! Who can overcome Islam? Who is the god of revenge and which God is the God of peace, love and kindness? Who gave Israel many miracles? The time is very near! Choose this day whom you want to serve.  God protects the airspace and intervenes at the right time. Israel defends itself and will strike back, and the God of Israel is surely on the side of Israel! The end will come soon, repent! Yeshua HaMashiach is the only Way and the Truth and the Life: Jesus Christ.  Keep your camera's focused! Israel, your temple gate has never been destroyed. Behold, I come very soon and I will go through the gate, and I myself will clear the entrance!  Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

t5_2qorf,arrozconplatano,1371004480,"&gt;Why is this necessarily a bad thing? There's nothing wrong with praising anti-statist elements of socialism. I don't have to agree with them on everything to praise what I do agree with.   Because anything that isn't *Austrian Economics™* is obviously evil.  /s  &gt;it's when they start going on their objective value crusade, which is nothing but an attempt to imprint the planners' values onto me, that I jump ship.  LTV isn't objective. It comes down to the belief that in a truly free market prices will fall to the cost of production including the subjective cost of labor.  &gt;I think it should be obvious Warren is more handling tradesmen with roughly comparable productivity, and he's only wanting this scheme so as to accomplish escape from parasitic (state-propped) economic relationships.   Warren used multipliers to adjust for the fact that some labor is in more demand than others.   &gt;I would like to suggest left-anarchists stress history because they don't understand, or more likely haven't read, what Mises said about history. It makes sense that schools of thought with less robust theories would want to substitute it with nebulous history whose accounts can be fitted to complement a value system.   No, left-anarchists stress that anarcho-capitalism isn't anarchism because by definition there is no authority in anarchy and capitalism is authoritarian in nature. They also don't want ancaps appropriating anarchist writers and claiming they would be capitalists if they knew about austrian economics.   &gt;I would prefer the vulgar egoists.   Egoism is incompatible with capitalism, again because it is authoritarian. An egoist scoffs at the non-aggression principle and any ""rights"". ",™

A group of tribes, essentially, and not a unified kingdom or nation or a homogeneous culture or anything of the sort.  Celtic groups spread as far to the west as Spain and as far to the east as Turkey and the invasion of/migration into the British isles was one wave of conquest. I suppose answering ""how"" the Celts expanded had to do with technology: they had iron weapons and relatively strong military discipline, and how and why they achieved a high level of cultural hegemony in areas they invaded is probably lost for history, and why they chose to expand or migrate probably is answered well by the first line of any Fallout™ intro cinematic.

(The species was first described in 1888, and it is not rare in primary forest in Madagascar.) The satanic leaf-tailed gecko is the smallest of 12 species of bizarre looking leaf-tailed geckos. They are nocturnal, arboreal geckos which exhibit extremely cryptic camouflage. They are only found in primary, undisturbed forests, so their populations are very sensitive to habitat destruction. They are endemic to Madagascar. Large *Uroplatus* species have more teeth than any other living terrestrial vertebrate species.  The leaf-tailed gecko is part of the complex cycle of circulating organic matter in the ecosystem. They are predators of small insects and small vertebrates  In 2004, the World Wildlife Foundation listed all of the *Uroplatus* species on their ""top ten most wanted species list"" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade because of it ""being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade"". It is a CITES Appendix II protected animal. (Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled.)",©

Because hippies used LSD for the experience? Because MDMA is a 'party drug'? Bullshit.  We can help people. We know that it works.

First thing you see is giant bloody tusky doom breathing hotly on your face. You panic and try to make a dash for the door. Not quick enough.   You feel the weight of the giant cat's jaws as they close around you. You try and scream but it's muffled by your Snuggy™ now wrapped around your head. Your short life flashes before your eyes.

Is it going to stop any second, chew you up, and swallow you? The thoughts race through your head for what seems like an eternity...   It stops.

You squint at it for a second... Your eyes widen, horrified. All you can see across the whole sky is a face. A giant flat face.   Have you been abducted my aliens!? It stares at you. You stare back. After a few minutes of this you calm down enough to come to your senses.   You have to escape! You look over the side. You aren't quite as high as you thought... Maybe 20 feet. In one swift motion you stand up and leap over the side. Before you hit the ground you notice something horrible. The cat. The cat is still here waiting for you. It will eat you this time for sure!   You hit the ground and twist your ankle pretty bad, but you get up and start sprinting in the opposite direction of the alien and the cat. They're right behind you you'll never make it. You run as hard as you can too terrified to look back. There's no way you can get away.   Or is there? What? Still running. Still not caught. You dart behind the closest tree and look back.   The alien is sitting, the cat laying beside it in the same place it was before. Maybe you'll be okay. Shame your parents are now dead and you're now Snuggy™-less. You moonwalk into the woods.    **TLDR:** *Poor mouse...*",™

MICHAËL, ALSO CALLED 'THE DRAGONSLAYER', BRINGS THIS MESSAGE OF GOD TO BENJAMIN COUSIJNSEN, GOD'S TRUE SIMPLE END TIME PROPHET. Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, Shalom and welcome! On February 5th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. I am Michaël.  Verily, verily, I tell you, Mighty and powerful are all deeds, and marvelous is His name: Jehovah Jireh! There is power in the Blood of the Lamb! The time is near; stand in your power!  Ephesians 6, verse 16 Above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.  Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ spoke with authority! Demonic powers know if you are really clothed with Christ's authority, or not. Whom would you fear, when Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, is with you and before you? Verily, hear!  Mark 3, verse 14 And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach, Mark 3, verse 15 and to have authority to cast out demons.  Matthew 10, verse 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.  Matthew 10, verse 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hidden, that shall not be known.  Verily, fallen angels and demonic powers know if you have doubt and unbelief in you! Therefore, speak to them with faith and authority! And commend them to let go: Get out in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ!!  Luke 4, verse 35, and Matthew 8, verse 16, and Acts 19, verse 11, and Matthew 17, verse 19 to 21 Read this aloud. Here it is written: Luke 4, verse 35 Jesus rebuked him, saying, ""Be silent, and come out of him!"" When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.  Matthew 8, verse 16 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick.  Acts 19, verse 11 And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul. Matthew 17, verse 19 to 21 Jesus answered, ""Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."" Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, ""Why weren't we able to cast him out?"" He said to them, ""Because of your unbelief. For most assuredly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting.""  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  If you have accepted Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, you may be sure that you're more than a conqueror, and the Blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, has broken the devilish fallen angels, with his powers and any attack whatsoever, by His beloved precious Blood! Go stand in your faith, beloveds of Yeshua HaMashiach, He is Lord, Jesus Christ! Thank Him! Praise Him! Be glad and sing delighted. He is the King of kings.  Verily, without Him, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, I, Michaël, would not be the dragonslayer. You are more than a conqueror! I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!  SHALOM!

t5_2qpzs,HilscherFarms,1371030337,"&gt;I can't be proud just being a good person who sits around playing videogames, not wanting to hurt people. I'd be proud if I had a good job and a home of my own. But I don't.  You're disenfranchised; if you had a job and a house, you'd have a seat at the table in the society, and you'd be socially proofed, right?  But I think if you had those things, you'd still be unhappy. In order to maintain those things, you would be taking on even more obligations in return for that social approval. Social approval, which, when you get it, you find out it's positively worthless. Social approval is only good for improving your mate value to attract and maintain a relationship. Is a long term relationship something you want? And if so, where does it rank on your priority of things you want?  &gt;You seem like someone who has genuine care in your heart, why would someone like you be alone even by choice? That doesn't make sense to me about the world...  Actually, I'm very bitter and full of hate for the world. I used to be kind -- and when I was, I was wretchedly depressed. As time went on, I became more spiteful, cynical, and contemptuous of the world -- and it stopped me from being depressed. I went from soft to Some Kind of Hard™. Maybe that sounds awful to you, maybe you want to be kind. But do you want so much to be kind that you'd die for it? Because it's killing you.  Do you know who Diogenes was? He was a man who rejected the society he was living in, and chose to live in mockery of the culture he hated. He severed himself completely from social approval, lived with dogs on the street, flipped people off all day long, and styled all over the status quo thumping Plato school of philosophy and founded Cynicism. He didn't live in hedonistic bliss, but he lived for himself, in 'enlightened poverty.'  My point is, you don't have to 'man up' to harden yourself, you just have to start mocking and scorning the things that deserve mockery and scorn. Be less kind. Play more vidya. Show your finger to those who say you shouldn't, and play them twice as hard just for them. It's what I did.",™

Even if the play through is shorter you paid less so you still got what you paid for, right? And same units? you played as zerg compared to terran. The campaign mode is also slightly modified. All in all it was an expansion and not a dlc.   I just checked the CIV ""DLC"" and I'm surprised at how much they added I wouldn't really call it a DLC. Especially they call it themselves an expansion pack:   &gt;Sid Meier's Civilization® V: Brave New World is the second expansion pack for Civilization V  DLC in my view is something that could have fit into the main game.

It shows me that you will go anywhere to have a ""good"" time and that's not okay even if you are having a dry spell.*  I'd be interested in learning about her past. Pretty brave declaration from someone who most probably had her share of one-night stands and carousel riding.  And don't let me start on how most women don't know jack shit about ""dry spells"". For them it means a couple of weeks, maybe months but that's rare. For men it could mean years. Couple that with the fact that men have about 10 times as much testosterone (causing the sexual urges in both men **and women**) and you might start to understand how a dry spell has an entirely different meaning for the sexes.  &gt; you would stick your dick in anything  *""Anything""?* I had sex with an escort who was at least a 9 but I'd given her a solid 10 if she had just a tiny bit bigger tits. And I'm a lazyass guy who can't be bothered to put up a charade long enough to attract these types of gals otherwise, so pardon me if I take this stupid, ignorant moralizing from a (presumably) average woman with a grain of salt. Yeah, I put my dick in the most beautiful woman in town, and I had to cough up a whopping 67$ for it. (It happened in eastern europe, this is actually a relatively high price there.) The best handful of money I've ever spent.  For me having sex with escorts is an easy way to ""score"" above my own SMP value. Realistically I'm a 7, which is better than average, but 10s would never give me the light of day, a fact which I am not ashamed to admit because I know how the SMP works.",♀

t5_2fwo,WalterBright,1371050390,"**Abstract:** Professional Programming in teams requires a common clean coding style. This could be enforced using code reviews, but the simpler and less offensive way to achieve this is by using a tool as style cop. It helps spreading the conventions about the language in the team and assisting new team members in easily adopt to the programming style by getting fast feedback on their code. Having such a static code analyzer refactoring becomes easier, because it reminds about now unused variables, unused parameters or other refactoring artefacts.   This talk will introduce you to AnalyzeD, explain you how it's working, and give you an outline about what's planned.   AnalyzeD is currently used for checking 250kLOC of production code against programming conventions and determines metrics.ent state and what is planned to develop/release.  **Benefits:**  ◾Information about Static Code Analysis for D.  ◾DPaste like Web Application.  ◾Extended D toolchain (Styleguard, Metrics, D1to2).  ◾Cleaner Code due to removal of e.g. unused variables.   **Speaker Bio:**  Stefan Rohe studied computer science in Germany and worked at Fraunhofer Institute. In 2008 he joined the industry where he got the chance to redesign a complete server application in D. Now there is a complete Scrum team of D professionals having about 80% of the code base emerged to D.  [slides](http://dconf.org/talks/rohe.pdf)",◾

Sto se moze shvatiti tako da su u obavezi da im daju direktni ili skoro direktni pristup. Koliko se meni cini, dovoljno je da neko sedne za komp u kancelariji, uradi dupli klik na Prisluskivac™, ukuca koga hoce da vidi i toliko. Ako ne bas direktno, pozove nekog u Telekomu, kaze ko ga interesuje, i on mora da mu posalje mejl sa informacijama bez pitanja i odmah.   Doduse, po clanu 6:  &gt;Nadležni državni organ koji ostvaruje pristup, odnosno kome se dostavljaju zadržani podaci, dužan je da vodi evidenciju o pristupu, odnosno dostavljanju zadržanih podataka, koja naročito sadrži: određenje akta koji predstavlja pravni osnov za pristup, odnosno dostavljanje zadržanih podataka, datum i vreme pristupanja, odnosno dostavljanja zadržanih podataka, kao i da ovu evidenciju čuva kao tajnu, u skladu sa zakonom kojim se uređuje tajnost podataka.  Znaci moraju da zabeleze zasto pristupaju podacima, ali i razlozi su tajna tako da je pitanje koliko su primorani da to postuju.  A sto se tice toga sta mogu da vide, Clan 129 stav 1: &gt;Obaveza operatora iz člana 128. stav 1. ovog zakona odnosi se na podatke potrebne za:  &gt;1) praćenje i utvrđivanje izvora komunikacije;  &gt;2) utvrđivanje odredišta komunikacije;  &gt;3) utvrđivanje početka, trajanja i završetka komunikacije;  &gt;4) utvrđivanje vrste komunikacije;  &gt;5) identifikaciju terminalne opreme korisnika;  &gt;6) utvrđivanje lokacije mobilne terminalne opreme korisnika.  Znaci mogu da vide koga ste zvali, kad i koliko dugo i sa kakvog aparata, i gde se nalazite. Telekom inace zna gde se nalazite po prirodi mobilne mreze.

t5_2qore,HerpDerpenberg,1371059673,"It's the same reason I didn't like when they just increased drop rates of legendary items and 61/62/63 rares on release.  It was a band aid fix really.  To go back to the drop rate example, they pretty much doubled the iLvL63 drop rates early on, didn't change the quality of items that were rolling just people had to sift through twice as much shit.  This introduces ""good"" items to the market at twice the rate.  Everybody has the same drop rates so everyone is getting just as ""good"" of items.  Good transitions to ""shit"" and rinse/repeat for each step up.  Another example was Ziss streamer who was crafting something like 3000 amulets when he already have a pretty fucking amazing amulet.  He was essentially looking for a perfect quadfecta amulet to be an ""upgrade"" at that point.  It takes about 2000 necks rolls to get a quadfecta and that's just to get them to roll.  They can still roll shit (which happened to him) so if you're looking for a near perfect quadfecta roll amulet you're actually looking at something more like 260,000 amulets to see one.  **I have got a spreadsheet that breaks all this down, not ready for release yet as I'm working out the bugs but look for it soon™.**  It's going to be tough when Blizzard wants every legendary or rare you pick up to have that ""how good is this"" mentality.  It just raises the bar for what you think is good at that point without decreasing the chance of rares to drop. ",™

I was just generally trying to point out that the size of the real estate market makes the city directly unable to intervene. You need to be the US Fed to be able to conjure up that much money.  The city can steer the housing market, as they are trying with laneway housing, or by making it easier/harder for more housing to be built. But it seems like every time anyone anywhere in Vancouver brings up the idea that more housing might equal more affordable housing everyone who lives there seems to lose their mind.    As for the HIP where it says “The MLS® HPI data is now available to download in Excel (.xlsx) format.” That download link has the actual housing prices in it going back to 2005, not just the % change. However it does not actually seem to specify what geographical area it is, but 300k seemed about right given what you see advertised around Vancouver and other work I’ve done recently.

Please share and do not change © BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! Welcome to this special message of today. Benjamin Cousijnsen was called three times in his sleep on June 6th, 2013. He heard, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin... And Benjamin thought, it was an angel of the Lord, as always. He walked into the small room, where he has always encounters with the angels of God, opened the door, and the Lord was standing there... Benjamin actually wanted to cast himself at His feet, in order to worship Him. But the Lord gestured very graceful, Just take a seat over there and start writing. I'll start with the message now.  Shalom, peace be to you! Verily, verily, I tell you My child, It is I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Before you were formed in the womb, I knew you already. I have always loved you, My beloved, and protected you from the first day. Verily,  James 1, verse 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.  Verily, I do not look at your past; it's blank, whiter than the snow! I'm not far away, or someone you need to be afraid of. But I am love.  1 John 4, verse 16, and 1 John 5, verse 12 We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. He who has the Son has the life. He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.  My beloved, if your heart is broken, I'm close. I cherish you close to My heart. I, the good Shepherd, will carry you, even if you find your life difficult. I am with you. Forgive your neighbor, your brother and sister and all that have hurt you.  Grab your Bible and read for yourself: Colossians 3, verse 12 to 15, and verse 24 and 25  Verily, also I have been able to forgive you, and borne your sins in love.  Read aloud: Galatians 5, verse 22, 23 and verse 25 Here it is written: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control. If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit. The Lord Jesus Christ spoke further,  My beloved, you are valuable to Me. I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the Lord, and disappeared.  SHALOM! The Lord bless you   Note: Full text display for the deaf, hearing impaired and speakers of other languages...

You're not there to get your general education, you're there to become a priest.  Getting confused about a high school is one thing, but this is basically Priest College™.  That's a little harder to get mixed up over.  There are hundreds of options for kids who can't go to certain schools.  I've experienced them myself.  In addition to homeschooling, there are charter schools, ""independent study"" schools (usually for students with emotional or medical issues where you check in once a week), and private schools.  Even if he can't afford a private school, when you are under the age of majority the government legally has to provide a basic education for you, and if you successfully argue that a student cannot complete his work at one school, they will provide you with resources for any of the other options.  Priest College™, however, is not anything remotely like regular school.  And this kid should have known that.... or rather, I think he *would* have known that, which is why I slightly suspect the veracity of OP's post.  I really hate saying that, I do, because it makes me feel like a bitch and I want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  If this was an inner city kid whose public school was plagued by gangs... well a city like that would have at least one more public high school, or at the very least another charter school.  Unless the only families in the entire city were either thugs or evangelical crazyfaces, there would have been SOME midway point.  I've seen some awful Christian/Catholic High Schools out there.

The representative of the readers, 'netw3rk' (seriously?), says at one point, ""Listen, I get it: I’d slit my own wrists before I drank a blended scotch, but there are only so many “bests” of any particular thing. After I’m done with those, I still want something to read.""  Really, dude? You'd *slit your wrists* before deigning to drink Johnnie Walker Blue?

Except you really haven't done much homework and have no actual idea what the fuck you are talking about.  Then the TV Guy makes the argument that Game of Thrones does a fabulous job of ""set[ting] characters loose inside [the fictional world] in order to better plumb the depths of the human condition"" whereas the books fail to do that completely, and goes on to suggest that, on the page, Martin's characters ""seem restricted, and not like living, breathing (or in many cases, choking-on-blood) people."" I don't think many people who have actually stuck with the books would agree that the characters seem ""restricted"" or wooden. I don't think Martin is above criticism, but I think that particular criticism is pretty fuckin' absurd.

t5_2qh13,Realist14,1371072924,"The fact that those are the best you could come up with proves my point. The contributions of the White race are many thousands that of the tiny percentage of blacks who manage to pass as civilized human beings.  Your liberal race denying argument is typical in that it does not address the facts, but instead relies on individual cases, which as any *educated* person knows are not statistically significant. (But then again, that clearly isn't you based on your post).  Instead, like a typical liberal, you continue to dodge the facts and hurl insult after insult as if focused aggression is the difference between right and wrong. The *facts* that blacks have low IQs and have higher testosterone making them violent. The *facts* that blacks have never created a developed or advanced society!  We live in an age where liberal dogma fed to us by Jewish media is regarded as truth, where scientific discovery is marginalized and ridiculed as being Racist™. We will be known as the Galileos of our time, those who preached the truth even though others were too close minded to analyze the *facts* - that blacks are stupid and violent!",™

t5_2qh2p,Because_Poop,1371073873,"I went to an all girl's catholic high school. There were many things I disagreed with such as if you were even rumored to be pregnant, rumored to have had an abortion, rumored to be gay, you would be kicked out or put on some kind of contract. The biggest thing I can remember that made me completely sway into being agnostic (not quite an atheist still) was the retreat we were forced to go on senior year. We were stuck in a room with no windows in a basement and given endless lectures on Catholicism. We had groups we were forced to talk about the most horrible things in our lives, and were told why those things happened (I talked about how I was molested) and how if we had accepted Jesus Christ as our lord and savior those bad things wouldn't have happened. We were only allowed to sleep for about 3 hours a night. We were not allowed to use a phone, and my psychiatric medications were withheld. The retreat lasted three days. Nearly all of my classmates had some sort of religious experience, and if they weren't already Christian, they converted. I however, had a psychotic break and spent tree weeks afterwards in my bedroom trying to forget the horrible things that were drawn out of me, an starting to get my sense of self back. I compeletely understand where you are coming from. Not all Christians are like this, we happened to get stuck with some bad ones 😔",😔

t5_2to85,M1LK3Y,1371074625,"Placeholder comment for **statistics post.**  Also I'm calling that Nebris wins this season. First FFA season to include potions. (He *almost* has potions.)   **STATISTICS**   Everybody’s favorite new math-guy is back for his fifth round of statistics. To calculate standing in UHC, I use my [COOLNESS EQUATION ™](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1foib0/uhc_xi_episode_1/caczfzd) which you can read about on the other side of that link. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1g2q43/uhc_s11_e4/cag642m) are last episode’s statistics.  Without further ado, I give you the statistics.  **Player number** At the end of this episode, 11 players remain. This puts all remaining players at 9.09% chance of winning.  **Health** In total, there are 81 hearts in the game (25.5 fewer than last episode). 3 players have full health (2 more than last episode). Each of them have 12.34% of all health in the game.  *BTC and Anderz,* at 9.5 hearts, have 11.7% of all health each.  *Millbee,* at 8.5, has 10.4%.  *Palratt and Etho,* at 7, have 8.6% each.  *Zisteau,* at 6 hearts, has 7.4%.  *McGamer,* at 3, has 3.7%.  *Bdubs,* at 0.5, has 0.6%.  **Armor** In total, there are 85 Armor Points in the game. 8 players have 7.5 armor. They each have 8.8% of all APs.   *Palratt,* at 9, has 10.5%.  *Pyro and McGamer,* at 8, have 9.4% each.  |**Protection rates**   *Palratt* is blocking (on average) 73.6% of damage.  *McGamer and Pyro* are protecting against 67.2%.  *Etho* is protecting against 66%.   *Millbee* is protecting against 62.4%.  **Gold** In total, there is 89 gold (43 less than last episode) in game. 1 player (BTC) has no gold. One golden apple counts as 8 ingots.  *Pyro, at 9 and 2 apples, has 28.2% of all gold.  *Guude,* at 16, has 17.9%.  *Millbee,* at 6 and 1 apple, has 15.7%  *Nebris,* at 10, has 11.2%  *Bdubs,* at 7, has 7%.  *Etho,* at 6, has 6.7%.  *Anderz,* at 4, has 4.4%  *Mc,* at 3, has 3.3%.  *Palratt and Zisteau,* at 2, have 2.2% each.  **OVERALL** My [COOLNESS EQUATION ™](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1foib0/uhc_xi_episode_1/caczfzd) puts Pyro in the lead with 61.13 COOL POINTS (those golden apples pay off.), Guude in second with 48.99 COOL POINTS, and Nebris in third with 45.15 COOL POINTS. In last place (for now!) is Bdubs with 13.33 COOL POINTS, which is 21.81% of today’s leader, Pyro.  **Note on COOLNESS** My COOLNESS EQUATION ™ is in Alpha. This is the first season I have used it. It seems to be valuing health and gold very highly (which was intended, but it may be too much), and armor and weapons less so. It was very accurate early in the season but now with variable like so much gold and enchantments being thrown in, it's beginning to maybe not be as accurate. I will, for the sake of continuity, keep using it for this season. But NEXT SEASON, we'll have a bigger, better, badder COOLNESS EQUATION ™.  **Rank list coming**  Pyro  Guude  Nebris  Millbee  Anderz  BTC  Etho  Palratt  Zisteau  McGamer  Bdubs  **Extra bonus statistic:** It took me 1 hour, 25 minutes, and 11 seconds to make this post.",™

t5_2qhcs,bobaroo120,1371090585,"The handicap system requires you to take a maximum score on every hole based on your handicap.    [Here's the explanation from the USGA website and the limits by handicap](http://www.usga.org/HandicapFAQ/handicap_answer.asp?FAQidx=9):    Section 4  Adjusting Hole Scores for Equitable Stroke Control (ESC)™  Q.  What is the current method for adjusting my hole scores under Equitable Stroke Control (ESC)?  A.  ESC is an adjustment of individual hole scores (for handicap purposes) in order to make handicaps more representative of a player's potential ability. ESC is applied after the round and is only used when the actual score or the most likely score exceeds a player’s maximum number. ESC sets a limit to the number of strokes a player can take on a hole depending on Course Handicap™. Apply ESC to all scores, including tournament scores. Below is the maximum number a player can take:  Course Handicap	 --   Maximum Number  9 or less	     --     Double Bogey  10-19              --   	7  20-29                --  	8  30-39	                --        9  40 and above	 --       10",™

t5_2xbrg,-AbracadaveR-,1371113863,"This cat actually has a bit of a back-story. And he might be brain-damaged, far as anyone can tell, which could explain the face. He was found at the side of a highway as a kitten, badly injured (no-one knew just *how* badly at the time though). My friend stopped her car and her teenage(?) daughter got out, ran across several lanes of traffic, scooped him up and put him in her jacket. Then we got a phone call. ""You like angry cats, right?""  First time I met him, he bit right through my thumb. Adorable.   We said yes, we'd take him in, even though my previous cat had died not that long before and I didn't really feel like having another cat just yet, especially not another orange one... but my feelings were trivial compared to the little guy's need for help, so I put those aside as best I could and we took him home.   At first, we could barely get near him, but within a few days he'd let us take him out of his room and he started exploring the house a little, and we noticed he walked kinda funny, favouring one of his back legs. A quick check suggested that it was broken, and since we'd been intending to take him to the vet for a check-up as soon as he'd let us pick him up, we figured it was a good time to do so. As it turned out, we were right. The x-rays showed massive damage to that back leg - shattered in two places. The vet told us what I'd been kinda suspecting, that it was most likely someone had kicked him hard or stepped on him, and just dumped him beside the road to ""take care of the problem"". Humans are arseholes. So anyway, the options were to remove the leg, or have him put down.   I couldn't stand the thought of just killing him, not after he'd been through so much without ever having a chance of a peaceful, happy life, and not after my last cat... so despite the cost (over $1k that I didn't have) we decided on the operation. We'd sort the money out somehow, and the vet, sympathetic to both the cat's case and ours, gave us whatever discounts and free services they could afford to, bringing the cost down by a few hundred dollars at least, though it was still a little over a grand. But a few other people chipped in, help came from places we never would have suspected. I suppose not *all* humans are arseholes, after all.  Anyway, he recovered well, and started to get pretty comfortable at our place. Even happy. And once he was allowed out of his healing crate, he started ""dancing"" around the house in sheer kitty joy. Which is what led to his name. Originally, we called him Rorschach, because angry little ginger (Watchmen, anyone?). But then he developed his signature dance move. He'd get up on that one remaining back leg, fling his arms over his head (like a Y shape) and *leap* around like that.   Thus, The Flying Y.   ___  So anyway, that's the Y's story. Just thought I'd share, in case anyone wanted to read it, I dunno. And yes, I've grown to love the weird little idiot. He's now a very happy (if rather strange) cat, living in a trailer with me out in the woods these days, and he has his own facebook page and his own bunk bed. That's what he's lying on in this photo, actually. The bunk, not the fb page. Obviously.  And he still bites. ♥",♥

t5_2cneq,twentyithly,1371134882,"I can think of some ideas to have connected appliances. Dishwasher: track level of rinse aid, how full it is (by weight), how many cycles it has done, monitor system functions like water temp. and pressure. Keep all that info on a website, email me when it needs maintenance or rinse aid.   Fridge: Monitor temperatures, integrate a panel for recipes on the door (wouldn't be cool to have the entire fridge front all glass, you can make it transparent to look inside without opening the door, touch it again and look for recipes). Maybe you can have a scanner, scan the milk carton's barcode for example and always place the milk in the right location. The fridge can monitor your usage and text you to buy more milk for example. All that data can be stored on a website.  Stove: Again monitor and keep track of usage (for power consumption reduction), hell maybe integrate that same recipe screen from the fridge. So let's say you select a recipe, it tells you want you need from the fridge, then on the stove itself, it readies the oven for you and/or tells you what temps are needed and cook times.   Even the toaster can be connected. What if it speaks to your fire alarm. If the toast is burning, it will tell the fire alarm to change the sound from deafening siren to a vocal ""hey your fucking toasts are burning"". Or a panel on the toaster, that could read something like ""hey user, you have some milk, sugar and eggs in stock - why not some french toast this morning, the toilet is telling me you could use some more protein today! I just turned on the stove top for you, the frying pan is still in the dishwasher and it's clean - have a nice day""  See, all of the above ideas will have people flocking towards the appliance store.

I insulted you because you're the kind of person who says ZSNES is a better SNES emulator than Higan because ZSNES runs faster despite being less accurate. Higan is **PER SCANLINE ACCURATE.** It's the only SNES emulator that perfectly runs every single Super Nintendo game.  These days it isn't so much about speed as it is about accuracy. What good is a high framerate if you're getting inferior image quality, crashing, or having corrupt textures?   I WANT NVIDIA to have competition but it doesn't exist.

t5_2t5iz,mattwuri,1371139694,"The other day I was strolling through Route 3 and a wild Nidoran♀ appeared. As soon as the battle started, I felt like there was something off about her. First off, she was really pale-looking... unnaturally so, and seemed to be covered in a thick layer of powder. Despite being ♀, she looked pretty muscular with prominent spines. She tried using Growl on my Squirtle but it didn't sound cute or endearing at all (in fact it had a really awkward, forced quality to it). Well, I caught it anyway because you told me I should meet and learn about all kinds of pokemon. It wasn't until I leveled it up to 16 that I finally figured out what was up, because that was when *she* evolved into a Nidori**no**!  As soon as that happened, she/he got really embarrassed and hid back in the pokeball right away. She/he seemed super bummed out about it, and for a period of time would refuse to come out and fight. Well, I decided to leave Nidorino with the pokemon day-care and went on my way.  A few thousand steps later, I went back to check on him/her and found her/him to be considerably calmer. By then she/he had put on that make-up (?) to look lighter again and one of the day care staff, Lana Wachowski, apparently knew of certain tricks to make the spines look blunter and less menacing. It appeared Lana had bonded really well with my Nidorino and they seemed to share a special understanding. She pulled me aside and quietly told me that she herself was ""the same way"".  I'd heard of these pokemon, but never thought I would run into one in the wild. My cousin in Sinnoh mentioned that this Gardevoir that's a bit of a celebrity in the contest circuit over there actually started out as a Gallade. Nowadays, if you go to Hearthome City you can actually buy treatments for your pokemon to... complete the transformation, so to speak.  Anyway, after talking to Lana I decided that I'm totally cool with my Nidori**na**'s life choices and how *she* identifies *herself*. I took her back and now I don't treat her any differently from my other pokemon (which unfortunately means she went straight to someone's computer box; you know how it is, I need my pokemon to be fabulous in battle, not just in life). I definitely feel like I learned something from this experience, and I hope this little anecdote was valuable for your research.",♀

t5_2qhk3,SRSLovesGawker,1371154358,"&gt; I think stoicism is just a form of hypermasculinity socialized into males in our society.  Do you have research to back this up? To be honest, this sounds like something a radical feminist would say as part of a litany about why Men Are Bad™.  Few if any men are completely disconnected from others, and few if any completely suppress all ""feminine side"" emotions. Men are still feel and are affected by the entire range of emotions available to women, we're just trained (some better than others!) to not let them rule our reactions in-the-moment, and perhaps less well trained in how to deal with multiple conflicting emotions simultaneously.  Compared to a caricature of masculinity like the one you described (completely disconnected and repressed), then sure; a guy who bawls like a schoolgirl at the first five minutes of the movie *Up* is probably more healthy than someone so stolid that he never cracks a smile or sheds a tear... but I've never personally met a man that repressed.",™

During the 14 months that followed, he began to use Ritalin® excessively, both orally and rectally, in dosages from **4800-6000 mg daily**. Four years ago, he was referred to our outpatient service, where his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder was re-evaluated. At that point, the patient's daily Ritalin® dosage was **reduced to 200 mg daily orally**, but he still experienced pronounced symptoms of, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder so this dosage was raised again. The patient's plasma levels consistently remained between 60-187 nmol/l-within the recommended range-and signs of his obsessive-compulsive symptoms diminished with fluoxetine 40 mg daily. **Finally, on a dosage of 378 mg** extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta®), his symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have improved dramatically  (Emphasis mine)  I'm not sure what typical 'misuse' dosing is like, and I would have thought it to be more periodic acute high-dose rather than the chronic medium-high dose, although I suppose it depends on the reason for use and cost of drug.",®

If you refuse to believe that multiplication of two negatives gives a positive, you probably state it should be negative (I guess you don't assume it should give zero). However, multiplying the same negative as No. 1 by the opposite (positive) of the second (which was negative) should give you... what? If negative again, then the second number in the first and second example is the same, i.e. the positive number is equal to its negative, or its double equals zero. ☹ If the result of the second example is positive, try the third example multiplying the two positive numbers of the same absolute value, and it will give you the same outcome.  Shortly speaking:  Let a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0. (-a)(-b) &gt; 0 - do not believe! So: (-a)(-b) = 0 (do not think so) or (-a)(-b) &lt; 0.  But what about a(-b)? If a(-b) &lt; 0 and |(-a)(-b)| = |a(-b)|, then -a = a, or 2a = 0, or a = 0. If a(-b) &gt; 0, and ab &gt; 0 (which you probably believe), and again, |a(-b)| = |ab|, then -b = b, or 2b = 0, or b = 0.

t5_2u5q1,tom_cannon,1371208894,"Most conventional plastic food bags are made of polyethylene.  Polyethylene is very permeable to air and you might expect such bags to leak over time.   However, we actually have had thin-wall polyethylene bags under test for over a year with no perceptible leakage through the bag’s wall or anyplace else.  This is because most foods contain moisture that can wet the interior surfaces of the bag, making them much less penetrable by air than dry surfaces. This includes the bag walls as well as its seal.  Placing foods under a vacuum accentuates this wetting process because it draws out more moisture.  However, you only get this benefit if moisture is drawn over the full interior of the bag, as is the case with ThriftyVac®.  In contrast, specialty vacuum bags that feature vacuum ports (or flat check valves) on their sides do not draw moisture over the full interior of the bag, and certainly not through the bag’s seal (which is fully closed during the vacuum packing process).  Accordingly, such bags do not benefit from completely wetted walls, and must be made of blends of plastic that are much more resistant to air migration through their walls and seals. Such materials include nylon and other relatively stiff plastics. Further, the sides of specialty vacuum bags must be textured to provide unobstructed air evacuation paths along the sides of the bag and into the check valve (or into the bag’s main seal).  Thus a typical vacuum bag consists of a special, high-quality main seal, a check valve (or vacuum port), textured plastic walls, and regular, un-textured low-permeability (i.e. expensive) plastic walls. Combining all of these components together adds complexity and cost to the manufacturing process, driving up the cost of specialty vacuum bags.  Heat-sealed bags avoid most of the complexity of vacuum-port bags, but still must have at least one textured side to assure an unobstructed air path to the main seal.  They must also be made of relatively expensive, low-permeability plastics. These two factors add cost.  Heat-sealing systems also have a significant vulnerability – excess liquids can hinder their operation.  The heat-sealing process works best when the interior surfaces of the bag are relatively dry.  Further if there is too much liquid in the bag being vacuumed, that excess liquid can flood the unit, be drawn into internal mechanisms, and degrade the system.  Accordingly manufacturers of heat-sealing vacuum packing systems recommend waiting until your food cools before vacuuming it.  Waiting can sometimes be inconvenient. More significantly, while you are waiting, your food can lose moisture.  Losing moisture not only makes your food less palatable, but also leaves less moisture available to wet the interior surfaces of the bag to improve vacuum retention.  In contrast, ThriftyVac® lets you vacuum pack your food immediately and works even better with moist foods.  There are no internal mechanisms or vacuum motor that might be fouled by excess liquids, and the ThriftyVac® assembly can be easily disassembled for washing and cleaning its components, if necessary.  For example, the rubber boot at the base of the ThriftyVac® vacuum pump is not bonded to the cylinder, but snugly pressed on.  This allows you to pull off the rubber boot and wash out fluids should they be drawn into the pump. Finally, the inlet to ThriftyVac® check valve is elevated 1.1 inches above the base of the unit to minimize the possibility of fluid being drawn into the vacuum pump.   ThriftyVac® works on all foods, moist or otherwise.  Dry foods can remain vacuumed for extended periods of time by adding a few drops of cooking oil at the interior ends of the bag’s seal.  This not only makes the seal work better (by blocking leakage paths), but also wets the two walls of the bag near the seal.  Wetting the walls typically causes them to stick together and block out air that otherwise might seep in through a poor seal.  My term for this phenomenon is “wall block.”  Wall block can allow even bags having poor seals to hold a vacuum for extended periods of time.  Such wall-to-wall liquid seals are the best type because our testing has shown that they can last for months. We would be happy to give a free bag of vacuum-pack almonds to the first 20 people who visit our location in La Plata, Maryland, so they can see for themselves how long bags vacuum-packed with ThriftyVac® retain their vacuums.

t5_2ty3s,IHaTeD2,1371215645,"I think most people are to much into graphic engines (Cry Engine, Unreal Engine, etc. etc.) due to the media hype. They don't really understand what an Engine is.  I'm no programmer, I learned myself some HTML and CSS in the past and some basics in graphics design all by myself were I was 13 (there were no php, sql or javascript standards in websites). I played around with things like RPG Maker but also with tools like Blender. So I'm a normal user but with some background knowledge, I have informed myself about software developing and understand it, depending on the language I could even read some code - depending on how complex it is of course.  But most people are just average gamer, they don't understand how games or even a computer works (I build my PCs by myself, pretty much LEGO™ for adults). But still they think they do, and then they try to use their ""knowledge"" to whine and try to be a smart ass.  I would have soaked up even dev videos about DayZ without being disappointed because I would be able to see the progress in various parts (or understand them if they are only noticeable when someone explains it like the server stuff), but most other people would rage and flame like crazy ...  It's kinda sad to be honest, if you like games and computers - why not inform yourself a little bit how they work? It's actually very fascinating.",™

Sometimes they discharge treated/untreated sewage into the river via in river pipes facing downstream. They do this regardless of rain, so no clouds necessary. If they're dumping while you're headed downstream, it's a jet/rooster tail of stuff a foot to a foot and a half high that you're gonna have to ride. Needless to say, most folks tip and go under, all paddlers without paddling skirts to keep the water out, end up with that stuff all over them and the inside of their boat until they can find a place downstream to pour it out. Then the next few days are spent in a smelly, cootified boat. Good times, Santori Times™.",™

The atomic bomb and meltdowns like Fukushima have made nuclear power synonymous with global disaster. But what if we’ve got nuclear power wrong? An audience favorite at the Sundance Film Festival, PANDORA’S PROMISE asks whether the one technology we fear most could save our planet from a climate catastrophe, while providing the energy needed to lift billions of people in the developing world out of poverty. In his controversial new film, Stone tells the intensely personal stories of environmentalists and energy experts who have undergone a radical conversion from being fiercely anti to strongly pro-nuclear energy, risking their careers and reputations in the process. Stone exposes this controversy within the environmental movement head-on with stories of defection by heavy weights including Stewart Brand, Richard Rhodes, Gwyneth Cravens, Mark Lynas and Michael Shellenberger. Undaunted and fearlessly independent, PANDORA’S PROMISE is a landmark work that is forever changing the conversation about the myths and science behind this deeply emotional and polarizing issue.",®

By the time you get to the point were the math is just a tool to understand concepts, and one homework problem takes 5-15 pages of paper, it's a bad idea NOT to use a CAS.

t5_2x6mz,kqr,1371240090,"&gt; I'm of the opinion that, in the majority of cases, exceptions cannot and should not be handled. If you've got an exception it's either a software error or an external failure (like the network goes down).  &gt; If the user should not be entering zero then I should be testing for input == 0 and then at that point throwing a UserInputError.   I think some of our differences here come from the fact that I'm used to Python, which is an EAFP (easier to ask forgiveness than permission) language, while you are used to something like Java, which is an LBYL (look before you leap) language. I'm used to any operation that may fail to throw a descriptive exception, and you're used to check for errors before even performing the operation.  For example, if I try to insert a value that's missing an important field into some structure, I expect an IncompleteValueException. If I lookup a value in a hashtable that doesn't contain that value, I expect a LookupError, and so on. These are the places where you would maybe return null or some other error code and be done with it. I prefer exceptions even for these cases if the alternative is null or an error code.  &gt; But it can't do that. You wrote your code months ago, compiled it, published it as a library. I'm just the consumer of your compiled library, nothing can be added to the signature of the method at that point. Now, of course, the compiler could restrict what kind of code I pass to your method and make sure I ""handle"" exceptions it doesn't know. But in that case, my only choice is to swallow exceptions your code is not able to handle even if the rest of my code, calling your method, could handle them gracefully.  Well, then the consumer is Doing It Wrong™. And I'm serious.  If I have developed a hash table library with a `getWith(function p)` method that looks up a value in the hash table based on a predicate `p`, that method should really only be able to throw a `LookupError` in case a value doesn't exist. It shouldn't be able to throw anything else.  If you pass in a `p` that can throw something, your `p` is badly designed. Your `p` should be total and reply either true or false depending on whether or not a value in the hash table passes.  And this is where things get amazing.  If you use any functions inside of `p` that can fail – the compiler will tell you exactly what kind of failure cases you need to handle! Say your predicate `isName` is supposed to filter out names by doing something like      function isName(string s):         return s.charAt(0).isUpperCase()  Now this may look innocent enough, but the compiler warns us that the `charAt` method may throw an `IndexOutOfBounds` exception. Which sort of hints that we actually have not defined what this method is supposed to do with empty strings! We decide that it is supposed to return false for empty strings as well (empty strings are not names), so we change it to      function isName(string s):         try:             return s.charAt(0).isUpperCase()         catch IndexOutOfBounds:             return false  Aaaand the function is now defined for all inputs, and the compiler no longer complains, because now the program is well-defined.  See here how the exception checking actually helped us getting rid of a bug in our code long before we had time to write a test for that specific use case? Checked exceptions are supposed to help like this, they are not supposed to be in your way.  Even if you have something complicated, say your predicate `p` is supposed to look each value up on the web, there's no problem with      // The compiler automatically infers this can throw HTTPErrors and NetworkErrors     function existsOnWeb(string s):         lookupOnWeb(""http://www.example.com/"", s)  then you do something like:      hashTable.getWith(function(string s):         try:             existsOnWeb(s)         catch HTTPErrors, NetworkErrors as e:             throw LookupError(e)     )  This is not just bending my code to suit the exception system, it is the sane thing to do. It means, ""If there occurred some error with the network bits, that's really an error during lookup, in this case."" If you think the syntax is clunky, you could even create neat syntax to do this kind of coercion for you. You could turn it into something like      hashTable.getWith(existsOnWeb !&gt; LookupError)  which means, ""Try this method and catch the exceptions it can throw and re-throw them as LookupErrors."" The `!&gt;` operator will *not* be turned into      catch Exception as e:         throw LookupError(e)  because the compiler knows exactly what exceptions the `existsOnWeb` method may throw, so it will only catch exactly those. Any `RuntimeException`s or `NullPointerException`s or `OutOfMemoryException`s will remain uncaught and propagate upwards, because it is impossible in general to check for them.  The reason the `getWith` method should only throw `LookupErrors` is that the guy who tries to look things up will not be trying to catch various kinds of network errors, he will be catching a lookup error. He should most definitely not be catching a wildcard `Exception` just because ""any method may throw any exception.""  &gt; ...which you then add to the signature of your method which causes more failures in more methods and so on. God forbid your code is popular library and adding a simple division now causes all your method signatures to change.  Oh, no. When you have decided on a contract your method should follow, you are not supposed to add further exceptions to it unless you made an error in your contract design. If your contract is sound, no user should ever feel the *need* to pass in code that throws SomeRidiculousException.",™

t5_2qh03,5yrup,1371243887,"As to the slow downloads; the slowest internet connection between all my friends and myself is 50Mbit. On top of that, they mentioned they've made some sort of streaming mode where it installs the basics (game engine and such) and the beginnings of the data and then lets you start playing while its still installing. So you don't have to download the entire game to start, chances are you'll only have to download several gigabytes. So worst case I'm probably only waiting ~15min for a game to start. Just head on over, start the game download, then go grab beers/snacks. By the time I get back and sit down the game will be good to go.  That's assuming I didn't add that friend as one of my 10 people that have access to my library. In which case, they would have already had the game installed and ready to go. I didn't even have to bring my disc over.  On top of that, the long download would only be a one time thing for playing the game. Once the download is done, its done. The game is always over there ready to be played. I don't need to bring the disc back and forth risking damaging it. Once a disc is scratched on the PS4, you're out $50. I could drop my disc in the shredder if I wanted to on the Xbox One, as all its good for is a fast install. Its not like I'll have to redownload the game every time I come over. One download and I never have to worry about losing or breaking a disc? I'll take that.  LOOKING AT THAT MORE, if I did have the disc, I could just use ""the fucking disc"" and install it there without having the download. I don't get how its any different.  You know, whatever.  All of those ads are stupid. Renting games is pretty rare these days. The only place I can go to rent videogames within 50mi of my home are Redboxes, which have an incredibly limited selection. *Most people don't rent games anymore.*  ISP's typically don't have ""routine maintenance"" longer than 24 hours. Also, for games that are on your account on your home Xbox, isn't the check in longer than 24 hours? The longest my internet has gone down for in the past *THREE YEARS* has been about 45min. I've had power outages last longer. On top of that, I've got a 4G hot spot in my pocket, a.k.a. my cell phone. As time goes on, we'll only have more stable internet connections. Its really less and less of an issue for the average American consumer.  Also, Xbox Live itself has very little downtime. Azure has very little downtime. I'd imagine if the Xbox Authentication servers were down for any noticeable amount of time something has seriously gone wrong because the entire west coast of the US has probably disappeared. We're not talking about Blizzard or EA hosting some small authentication servers for a single game and hoping they can scale it up fast enough, we're talking about *one of the largest cloud providers in the world.* They have one of the largest groups of computing available to them to make this work.  I mean c'mon. Its a Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style splatter fest on your comment.  *ON TOP OF ALL YOUR COMMENTS*, how could I do these things on the PS4?  How can I multitask and have a Skype session up with a friend?  How can I share a game with my brother on the other side of the state and my friend in Michigan? Ship the game back and forth across the country?  What do I do when my game disc gets broken or lost?  How can I get all my games on digital download? All Xbox games will be able to do that, not all PS4 games will be offered as a digital download, especially at the same time.  How can I control my console without having to use a controller? I can control an Xbox with motion controls, my voice, or Smartglass.  How can I watch HBO Go on the PS4?  Looks like the PS4 is just a complete failure! It can't even do these basic things!  Honestly I don't give a shit either way about the consoles. Chances are I'm not going to buy either one. I'm firmly a member of the PC Gaming Master Race™. I've seen the big benefits of having a digital game platform like Steam, so I'm happy to see it come to consoles. Personally I don't care about ""I really own this game, this little physical disc."" I'd much rather give up some ownership, probably pay a little less, and have access to it without having a fragile plastic disc determine if I have a game.  Also, I'd like to point out that the Xbox One is the #2 best selling device on Amazon's Video Game section. While there's still more PS4's being sold, I'd say sitting in the #2 spot after all this bad publicity means the Xbox One isn't going to be a failure. Might not sell as well as the PS4, but that doesn't exactly make it a failure.",™

t5_2qm7u,yesacabbagez,1371263874,"&gt;Keith Foulke was the Red Sox closer, and personally, I don't think he was better than Alan Embree (lefty/middle relief) or Mike Timlin (set-up guy, fire extinguisher).  Foulke had a higher K%, lower Walk% and allowed fewer HR.  The same Foulke who allowed fewer inherited runners  to score than either Timlin or Embree?  Foulke wasn't as good as them?  &gt;But honestly, can anyone name a team who did closer by committee and were successful? The Sox did in 2003, were awful, and by middle of the season made a move to bring in Scott Williamson.  The same Scott Williamson who saved zero games in 2003 for the Red Sox and one game in 2004?  Closer by committee and Bullpen Ace are different ideas.  Closer by committee is more or less the idea that who gets the save is irrelevant, just use whatever you have.  Bullpen Ace is use the best reliever at the most important time.  I am sure relievers like the idea of THE CLOSER™.  It gives them a fancy title.  THE CLOSER™ gets paid more than generic middle relievers.  If you got the option of being guy that works in office, or the SUPERMAN OF THE OFFICE which gets paid at least twice as much regardless of anything other than effectively saves, wouldn't you be in favor of having that title?  Teams pay out the ass for THE CLOSER™ even when there are legitimately good non-closers available.  The Giants did pretty well using Romo to replace Brian Wilson as THE CLOSER™.  Hell the Cardinals won in 2006 and they had Isringhausen as their closer for most of the season and he was terrible.  If non-closers don't have the mentality for becoming THE CLOSER™, then where the hell do closers come from?  It is just a learned ability?  Then why the hell is it even an issue at all if it is something that can be learned?  There are closers that are THE CLOSER™ and are fucking awful.  Jose Valverde shouldn't even be on a team, but he is THE CLOSER™ because in the past he has shown he did it.",™

t5_2qm7u,yesacabbagez,1371268463,"3 saves in 8 appearances.  Isn't that also the point?  Practically anyone can succeed in the role of THE CLOSER™.  There is no mindset to it.  There are simply good relievers, mediocre relievers, and bad relievers.  Relievers are inherently volatile because they throw between 25-33% of the innings of a starter.  There are a lot of pitchers that if you break down a random 50-60 inning sample they can look like incredibly different pitchers.  Relievers have to deal with pitching back to back days.  Often they are guys that has specific issues like platoon splits or control problems.  They can have a day where they get 2 outs but give up 3-4 runs.  Jordan Walden for the Braves this year is a great example.  He has only thrown 18 innings.  He has allowed 7 runs, but 5 of them came in three straight appearances immediately prior to a DL placement.  He has walked 4 people all year.  Two of them were in the 3 game stretch prior to his DL stint and the other two are IBB. 2011 he was a rookie and was the Angels closer.  In 2012 he was not the closer and dealt with some shoulder problems.  This year he is doing incredibly well as a non-closer.  Which is more likely, pitcher get THE CLOSER™ tag and instantly get this mental boost to pitch the ninth inning but nothing else, or that teams typically TRY to tag their best relievers as THE CLOSER™ but do not always succeed?  Do you think Mariano Rivera would just fall apart if he wasn't the Yankees closer?  He was an 8th inning guy he suddenly just shits himself on the mound?",™

But don't worry, if that's not enough they'll allow you to have unlimited internet at 64kbps.  Seriously, that's a good thing, other places will keep giving you ""high-speed"" internet and just charge you out the arse.  &gt;[""BigPond Elite® Cable plans can provide download speeds of up to a maximum of 30Mbps when downloading from capable sites""](http://www.telstra.com.au/latest-offers/broadband-offer/)  That's from Telstra, they own the infrastructure last time I checked and their only real competition is Optus.  That's the highest speed they can offer to a resident on cable internet.  I have never seen more than 1.5Mbit up, and I have the fastest unlimited data plan out of anyone I know, obviously not the best available but in the top 90% of ADSL plans.  I have friends who can stream 360p YouTube clips on a ""good"" day.  The download rate can reach 12Mbit at a stretch but it usually sits closer to 10Mbit.  I would love to have cable internet but I can't justify &gt;$100 a month for 500Gb of data as a student, on a 2 year contract.  Do you know what the new government (which will most likely get in this election) wants to do?  Decrease funding for the National Broadband Plan (yeah, we're building it right now because some places can't even get a tenth of what I download at) because it would be a waste of tax-payers money.  I seriously think you guys don't know how well you have it.  If you don't have anything better to do you could go through a [comparison website](http://broadbandguide.com.au/plans) of Australian wide internet.  Keep in mind that the majority of places cannot access ADSL2+, let alone think about getting cable, and the vast majority lock you in to 1 year minimum plans.",®
t5_2qh33,Doctor_Sauce,1371278110,"One time, during a super serious Ragnaros attempt in Molten Core, this mage put out a measly 935 damage (the equivalent of a single spell).   When confronted, he apologized and explained that the reason for his terrible performance was that he spilled an entire bag of Cheetos.   When the raid leader told him that it was no excuse, he grew adamant:   ""AN ENTIRE BAG!""   ""AN ENTIRE BAG OF CHEETOS!!!""   ""THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!!!""    So if you find yourself in an unfortunate situation, without a good excuse, definitely go for the Cheetos Defense® and STICK WITH IT.  It's going to payoff BIG for someone, someday.",®

In addition to Legal Observers®, Guild attorneys often provide legal defense for protesters who are arrested and bring civil litigation if needed. Legal Observers® are typically, but not exclusively, law students, legal workers and lawyers who may or may not be licensed locally. Legal Observers® are trained and directed by Guild attorneys, who often have established attorney-client relationships with activist organizations, or are in litigation challenging police tactics at mass assemblies. The presence of Legal Observers® may serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement during a demonstration. To request Legal Observers for an upcoming event, contact the National Office.",®

t5_2s7tt,megen,1371356932,"&gt;So your view is that we should just take away abortion entirely?  WTF?! I don't even know what prompted you to say that.  &gt;I'm not following you, because it seems to me that you're just saying that we shouldn't give men an equal choice, solely because they are men.  There is no ""equal choice"" here; what don't you get about that?! A man can't force a woman to undergo any medical procedure, either legally or ethically. They have no choice. Yes, it really sucks if a man wants *nothing to do* with his child, but we're talking about the lesser of two Bad Things™: either (1) making the man support a child he wants nothing to do with, or (2) leaving the child without adequate support, possibly to grow up in a poor environment. The choice here is obvious, isn't it? How could you possibly think (2) is better for the child or society?  &gt;I'm absolutely done with this conversation.

t5_2qh96,jbisinla,1371366424,"&gt;Basically, what you're saying is I should Just Do It™. I've tried this but that rat-bastard won't shut the fuck up.  No, just doing it without a greater goal in mind is impossible. Start working on the greater goal and you'll find that this stuff gets knocked out as you go.  &gt;Sure, I like programming, but I don't want to do it for at least 40 hours a week every week just to pay the bills.   Then that's not what you want to do. What do you want to make your life's work? What do you want to say you've accomplished at the end of it?  &gt;I'd like to study algebraic topology. I'd like to go wild on a racetrack with a Porsche 911. I'd like to play street futbol with the locals of Sao Paulo. I'd like to work as a pastry chef.  You can do any/all of that on vacations or in your spare time as a hobby, you don't need to be rich for any of that.  &gt;That's the motivation behind retiring early. I don't want someone telling me what I should do for 8 hours a day. I want complete freedom.  Screwing around gets old after a while. You need a sense of greater purpose. Until you find it, you're going to have to listen to that little voice. Even in the unlikely event that you do succeed and reach early retirement, that little voice is going to say ""Hey, what's your legacy going to be? Getting rich and driving go-karts? Playing around in the slums with street kids, knowing that you can get on a jet to Thailand the next day, while they have to hope their next meal has enough calories to avoid malnutrition? That'll look great in your eulogy.""  TL:DR - Get counseling, find a greater purpose, or enjoy the internal nagging. ",™

t5_2qhx4,DonEri,1371367977,"Everyone's tellin you the same as I'm about to. For  you to be at a solid 170 at 10% BF you need 1700 cals a day, and that's only your BMR. Your caloric intake increases with what you do throughout the day.   Now let's say you're lightly active, including your lifting for 5 days a week. Per the Benedict formula you multiply my 1.375, which comes to 2337.  Since your trying to cut we go with a sedentary standard and only multiply by 1.2 putting you at 2040. This is your goal caloric intake per day; rest day or not. Your intake should never be under 1700 calories no matter what. If you eat less, you're being counterproductive if anything.  Now, your Macros. This is where it can be a pain in the ass. I'd say shoot for a 45/30/25 (protein/carbs/fats). Usually on a bulk it'll be about 1.5g of protein for every pound of solid mass, but for your cut we'll put it at 1.2. That puts you at 195.6g of protein per day. So let's say 200g to make it easier. Your Protein intake is of the upmost importance while cutting. Spread it out through the day, but your largest intake will of coarse be post workout. To meet your protein requirement protein shakes make things so much easier, but can't be your main source of protein. I highly recommend an Isolate protein. There are so many out there and they all claim so much, but you need the cleanest form you can get the will be used at the most important times--&gt;[Immediately after your workout, and first thing in the morning.] I just picked up a 5lb tub of ""IsoPure"" from GNC for like 50 bucks with my gold card. Whatever you do don't let them suck you into buying their wheybolic and hydro builder stuff. All of those have ""time released"" proteins that are actually just fillers and are just different types of less pure/harder to digest proteins mixed in. I can explain further if needed, just ask.   Now your carbs and fats are your next on the list. These are your source of energy during the day and your fuel to get through your workout. Limit your carb intake post workout to about 20-30g. No fats post workout if possible but it won't hurt you if you have a little. Beans and oats are a great source of carbs for you, granola bars should do the trick as snacks during the day. I love Cliff bars, and their protein bars are a perfect afternoon snack.   Let me know if this helps out. I've told a few others the same stuff, and know for certain it's worked for me. If you start eating like this you're not in a lose anymore weight. Quit paying so much attention to the scale like most women(including my wife). Your priority needs to be BF content. Measure everything and take picture for notable changes. Measure your shoulders, biceps, chest, abdomen, waist, and thighs. Give it 4-6 weeks before you start wanting to see major differences.   Let me know, or ask anything I may help you with. ✌         ",✌

t5_2qh1i,gfixler,1371399346,"That's fine, but you are by your own definition in an uniformed place. I was there for 20 years. I switched to Linux in a huff after being very badly hacked on Windows, and being sick of some recent other issues with it. It was a bit of a struggle to switch. I did my old trick of keeping notes of things that bug me - it's a good way to vent. It didn't have UltraEdit32, which was IMO the hands-down best editor I'd ever used in 20 years of writing code. I reluctantly gave Vim a try, and now, 6 years on, UltraEdit looks like a child's toy to me.  I've actually had 2 coworkers recently convert after watching me work, because I'm orders of magnitude better than they could ever be in Notepad++ and whatever else they've been using, and that's by their own admission. One who is particularly resistant to change had to work with me for most of a day on some files, and the next morning came by and said ""Alright, screw it. How do I get Vim, because what you're doing in there is fucking unreal. I've never seen anyone do shit like that.""  See, Windows and Linux are OSes that run on general purpose computers. You can do *anything* on either. The problem is the Death by 1000 Cuts. EVERY. Thing. is a little harder to do on Windows. I work on Windows 7 at work, and every single thing I ever need to do is a little shittier than it is on Linux. Add it all up, and I really hate working on it. It's in my way at every turn - most of the time by little bits, but often enough throwing up complete roadblocks, like how it can't do more than 32 symlinks in a folder, which completely destroys *really beautiful architecture* of files, and stifles many really beautiful, powerful, and flexible workflows. I think it's been 7 times this year where I've said ""Well, on Linux we'd just use symlinks and this would work out great, but... well, I don't know. We'll have to figure out some shitty alternative.""  Full disclosure - I'm talking about this mostly from the standpoint of writing code (for 3D animation/art systems, albeit), but it does go much deeper to the level of hooking up hotkeys to window placement, and being able to link programs to system settings, and setting up a compose key só ît'ş ®ëmåŗĸàblŷ əą§¥ ẗ° tý¶ę lıkê tḩĩs, and a zillion other things I can never do on Windows.  From a getting shit done standpoint, though, I'm not even sure how to measure how much faster and more powerful I've become with the composability of Linux (and composability is the real reason it's so damned powerful). I know that I have no end of random questions that no one I work with can answer for me or themselves, which usually take me from seconds through a couple of minutes. I just answered a [really random one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1gfiow/what_is_a_useless_fact_that_you_know/cajwnhr?context=3), as a dumb example, but there are countless more.  I guess most people don't need all this power, but I must say that I never thought I did either, until I had it. Then I started to use it, and now I find the need for it *constantly*. We swell to fill our containers, and until you have abilities, you never learn to think in and with those abilities, and it stifles you. Having these megapowers has lead to things like me redesigning our entire production pipeline from scratch, and in the process improving every available metric, some by more than 3 orders of magnitude. The system gives me power, the power frees my mind, my free mind lets me think bigger, my bigger thoughts crave more power, the cycle continues, I eat worlds for breakfast, and once in awhile someone says ""But Linux is so hard to set up!"" and I turn toward the sound and wonder to myself ""What?""",®

No Linux is not perfect but its highly customizable, which does bring its own issues naturally. But due to its high customizability it can be resolved.

You have experience with one union, so you're ahead of about 90% of the bloviators, but you know nothing systematic about them. But you are 100% free with your opinion. It must be nice to not have to actually know anything that could get in the way of your biases.  As for businesses being run 'like a meritocracy', the naiveté is simply breathtaking. If you've ever been involved with a business larger than perhaps three people, and can still hold the opinion that there exists a single one that is actually run in this way, then you spent your entire tenure there with your eyes firmly shut. (And I, by the way, actually have the numbers to back up that assertion... [here](http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=533338989) is a goodie for you, just for one example.)  There are a lot of really complicated subjects out there. Traffic flow analysis. Politics. Economics. Has it ever occurred to you that most people think that they Know The Truth™ about labor relations, another complicated subject, but would certainly not venture to say that they Knew The Truth™ about traffic flow analysis, or international economics, or whatever? This is because one side of the equation has about 95% of the money, and has spent the last 40 years propagandizing ceaselessly against the other side, until 'everybody knows' that unions are bad and damaging and that corporations without unions are good meritocracies where everyone is happy and is paid what they are worth.  And meanwhile, at the same time that the unions are being destroyed wholesale, employees are seeing a smaller and smaller share of the wealth produced by their companies, poverty is spiking, accidents (although not actual deaths YET) are on the rise due to poor safety practices and no enforcement, employees are being cheated out of overtime pay on a systematic basis in many companies, and so on and so forth. All because employees have almost no power now.  Ah, fuck, never mind. I'm sure I won't be changing any minds here.

But that goes back to what you said when you kinda got it at the end. They're a silly organization of incredibly privileged white men who can't see the irony of what they're saying.  And yes, gender roles can be harmful to both sexes. That is why we need to work against patriarchal ideals, and guess who actually does that? Feminists. (SOURCE: I am a feminist writing papers looking at the toxic masculinity our culture perpetuates.)  And while toxic masculinity and the occasional custody dispute are a problem, look at how MRAs handle it: They rage about all women, and try to get feminist videos taken off of YouTube. They handle themselves terribly, they don't solve real problems, and basically function as a way for small-minded guys to attempt to perpetuate a system of patriarchy that simply can't sustain itself if humankind is to progress, or even continue.  Put it this way: There's a reason men's rights organizations are on the SPLC list of hate groups.",™

t5_2to85,Draconics,1371420516,"*NOTE: Wow guys, did you miss me? Done acing all of my finals, and now I can finally turn my attention to what really matters: writing power rankings for all of you lovely people!*  *NOTE 2: The 5 episode hiatus will make this slightly weird. I will be basing movements in this ranking off of the original E1 ranking (which was the only other one I’ve posted for this season thus far), so there will naturally be some massive movements. Get ready to see how accurate my early predictions were.*  *NOTE 3: While I actually do have time to write these, I’m still a little busy so they won’t be quite as comprehensive as I normally strive for them to be.*  **HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, “The Cheater” Nebris truly proved why he is one of the best strategic minds in the game when he became the first player to obtain potions in a PvP season. Meanwhile, Etho and AnderZEL made small improvements by enchanting, and silence fell when Millbee finally got a kill on Pakratt. BDubs started to make progress on his slow, but still possible comeback. MC finally fell to the deadliest cave since Guude’s and BDubs’ in S7. Guude and Zisteau both made strategically savvy moves—but were very different. Pyro continued his steadily successful season. Last episode was great, and I’m sure that everyone is excited for S7E7 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**Nebris** (Up 5)  *Why?*: It feels extremely weird to put someone with no enchantments on the top of this list this late into the season—but we all know why. Knowing Nebris, he will likely attempt to get enchantments before engaging anybody. Regardless, his potions still give him a huge advantage. Nebris is probably one of the most strategic and intelligent UHC players, and he shows it here. He is set to make 6 health potions, along with extremely useful buff potions (strength and speed will undoubtedly give him a huge advantage), and with his PvP abilities, he doesn’t even need enchantments.  *How Can They Improve?*: If he gets enchantments, he will be an even stronger favorite. I trust Nebris not to make stupid mistakes when making his potions.   *Season Outlook*: Extremely good—those potions truly show how much UHC has evolved. Meanwhile, he is an elite PvPer with high intelligence and strategic ability.   2	**Etho** (Up 3)  *Why?*: I might get some hate for putting him at 2, but before Etho Fanboy haters start raging at me, hear me out once more. With Pause out, Etho is almost unarguably the best PvPer left in the game. Only Nebris with his potions would have a good chance of beating Etho, despite the fact that some of the other players have a small health advantage on him. The best part about Etho is that he truly knows what he’s doing—he, Nebris, and Guude likely possess the best strategic minds (wow, I’ve been saying strategic **a lot** today) in the game, and he shows it with his knowledge of the game and his application of it to getting better equipment. His ability in archery is a huge asset with his Power 2 bow.   *How Can They Improve?*: Ideally, Etho could get another apple to eliminate the health advantage others have on him, but he’s probably set on hunting for people as it is. With strong enchantments and gear, I don’t blame him.   *Season Outlook*: Etho remains a perennial favorite no matter what, especially with Pause gone.   3	**Pyro** (Up 7)  *Why?*: In case you couldn’t tell from the huge movement that he made since Episode 1, I seriously underestimated Pyro. He is having one of the most efficient seasons so far, with strong equipment, extra apples, full health, wolves, and a lust for blood.    *How Can They Improve?*: He’s playing an extremely efficient season, and there isn’t much that he can do to improve. He could improve the enchantments on his equipment, but he’s probably better off going after people.   *Season Outlook*: He’s probably the dark horse of the top 3. While he doesn’t have the potions of Nebris, or particularly the skill of Etho, he’s quietly had an extremely good season up to this point.  4	**AnderZEL** (Down 2)  *Why?*: He is truly a lucky Viking. After being down an exorbitant amount of help, he made a truly AnderZEL style comeback.  *How Can They Improve?*: His enchantments are good and he's ready to fight.  *Season Outlook*: Very good considering how badly he was doing at one point.  5	**Guude** (Up 6)  *Why?*: Even though he doesn’t have enchantments yet, he is still an elite strategist, and that skeleton trap really proves it. He still has good health, and if he has good enchants, Guude may be on track to his most successful season since S4B.  *How Can They Improve?*:  If he gets enchants, he may be able to pull off a S4B like season with that skeleton dungeon.  *Season Outlook*: This is the best Guude has looked in several seasons.   6 **BlameTC** (Up 3)  *Why?*: While he isn’t as successful in the PvE aspect as he was last season, BTC is certainly having a successful season. He doesn’t have enchantments, but if he gets them, he’ll be in excellent shape.  *How Can They Improve?*: Get enchants, and that high health will give him a decent chance.  *Season Outlook*: It’s been a good season for BTC thus far. If he continues it, he may pull off a semi-come-from-behind victory.  7	**Zisteau** (Up 6)  *Why?*: Sky fortress. ‘Nuff said.  *How Can They Improve?*: Continue working on his Sky Fortress. It’s a big weapon in itself.   *Season Outlook*: Zisteau better hope that he’s good at SkyBlock…   8	**Millbee** (Up 6)  *Why?*: He is well equipped, but he must have an excellent recovery. Regardless, Millbee is having his most successful season ever. By a long shot.   *How Can They Improve?*: Obviously, recovering health is the most important priority.   *Season Outlook*: He has a chance with his equipment, but not much more.  9	**BDoubleO** (Down 1)  *Why?*: It doesn’t seem like he’ll last much longer. Regardless, killing Kurt is no small feat in itself, and there is that marginally small chance that he could potentially pull off a comeback for the ages.  *How Can They Improve?*: He needs gold.   *Season Outlook*: He must go out with a bang.  10	**Pakratt** (Down 6)  *Why?*: I had him ranked much higher than I should have, mainly because I knew that someone was going to get potions. Turned out it wouldn’t be Pakratt.  *How Can They Improve?*: He needs to improve his PvP ability. He is a slightly above average PvEer, but his PvE skills are severely lacking. Also, he should really stop wasting time with too many traps.  *Season Outlook*: Killed by a sheep.  11	**MCGamer** (Down 4)  *Why?*: Ninja creepers, man.  *How Can They Improve?*: ‘Twas a good season.  *Season Outlook*: Blown to smithereens.  12	**KurtJMac** (Down 11)  *Why?*: Sadly, Kurt finishes with his lowest placing ever.   *How Can They Improve?*: He fought well, but he must be a better PvPer to complement his elite PvE skills. *Season Outlook*: The Iron Kurtain has fallen.  13	**VintageBeef** (Down 10)  *Why?*: For the 4th time, Beef falls to the ninja.  *How Can They Improve?*: Beef is interesting because he is an extremely skilled PvEer (up there with the likes of Kurt), hence why he is able to consistently place so high (3 wins in the PvE seasons, along with several other high places in PvP seasons), though he always seems to fall to PvP. His lone PvE death was to a skeleton in S3 (not counting the glitch Enderman in S4A). Beef had the right mindset of trying to avoid the more elite PvPers this season, however.   *Season Outlook*: Maybe he can complain to the queen about Etho.  14	**W92Baj** (Up 2)  *Why?*: You have to admit, Baj was doing pretty well dodging mobs before that creeper. *How Can They Improve?*: Continue to use Baj Grylls.   *Season Outlook*: He’s going to have to drink his own… ;)   15	**Shreeyam** (Down 3)  *Why?*: He had a decent rookie season, but skeletons claimed him in the end.  *How Can They Improve?*: There’s a lot he can do, but it was only his first season.  *Season Outlook*: And another falls to the wrath of Dinnerbone.  16	**GenerikB** (Down 1)  *Why?*: He never stood a chance against the ninja.  *How Can They Improve?*: Do more UHC boot camps.  *Season Outlook*: His legacy lives on in the burnt remains of his head. Perhaps he will take revenge on Etho for destroying the relic.  17	**DocM77** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Dinnerbone’s revenge. ‘Nuff said.   *How Can They Improve?*: Don’t kill the guy that makes the game that you make money off of.  *Season Outlook*: He’s just a skeleton now.  18	**PauseUnpause** (No Movement)  *Why?*: He pulled a Beef 2.0.  *How Can They Improve?*: Learn to dig 1x2 holes into the wall when he sees Endermen better.  *Season Outlook*:  Well, he may have died in the first episode, but he gave us a great rage quit.  19	**Jsano** (No Movement)  *Why?*: The firefighter has an unfortunate resignation, as he must exit due to net issues.  *How Can They Improve?*: Fix his internet.  *Season Outlook*: Maybe if he can fix his internet…  20	**Dinnerbone** (No Movement)   *Why?*: I was seriously hoping he would get “Dinnerboned”, but getting “Doced” will have to do.  *How Can They Improve?*: Make skeletons less evil so people don’t hate him.  *Season Outlook*: He’s going to have to go the doctor first.  21	**Avidya** (No Movement)  *Why?*:  There are no gentlemen in Ultra Hardcore.  *How Can They Improve?*: Watch for Vikings.  *Season Outlook*: Unfortunately for Avidya, Vikings aren’t gentlemen.    *Writer’s Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1371420608,"&gt;&gt;Seralini's study was obviously a PR stunt on at least one level. I consider it a form of ""scientific asymmetric warfare,"" though many people might object to the use of the word ""scientific.""  &gt;I am not sure what you mean by ""scientific asymmetric warfare,"" Al Qaeda and the United States are obviously going to use different tactics, but in analysis of GMO's people are only supposed to use one tactic, the proper scientific methods, and Seralini does not appear to do this. He appears to be interested in publicity, not science.  That's the point though [see below] as the ""science"" is stacked against the anti-GMO forces so tactics that involve creative use of scientific [sorta] studies can bring PR pressure to bear on the **Forces of Darkness**™...  &gt;&gt;You mention that standard carcinogenic studies are only 6 months, but in fact, the first tumors in the Seralini study didn't even start to show up until month 4, so 6 months might not be sufficient to get a good idea of the issues.  &gt;As I understand it, rats over 6 months are ""old rats,"" and old rats get lots of spontaneous tumors. Which suggests the rats were only getting tumors because they were old. You want to do studies on young rats, so the tumors are due to true toxicity.  rats live to about 2 years of age. Here's the pattern of tumor development that Saralini's group found. You can decide whether or not a 6 month study would be appropriate to validate the pattern observed. I would say that IF the pattern persists, given a sufficiently large and well-designed study, that this is an important pattern, regardless of whether or not it would have been found using a ""proper"" carcinogenic study. In fact, it is why I suggested a custom study of at least 100 rats per group would be needed for a combined full-life toxicity study PLUS a standard carcinogenic study that was also extended for the full lifespan of the animals:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637  &gt;3. Results  &gt;3.1. Mortality  &gt;Control male animals survived on average 624 ± 21 days, whilst females lived for 701 ± 20, during the experiment, plus in each case 5 weeks of age at the beginning and 3 weeks of stabilization period. After mean survival time had elapsed, any deaths that occurred were considered to be largely due to aging. Before this period, 30% control males (three in total) and 20% females (only two) died spontaneously, while up to 50% males and 70% females died in some groups on diets containing the GM maize (Fig. 1). However, the rate of mortality was not proportional to the treatment dose, reaching a threshold at the lowest (11%) or intermediate (22%) amounts of GM maize in the equilibrated diet, with or without the R application on the plant. It is noteworthy that the first two male rats that died in both GM treated groups had to be euthanized due to kidney Wilm’s tumors that were over 25% of body weight. **This was at approximately a year before the first control animal died.** The first female death occurred in the 22% GM maize feeding group and resulted from a mammary fibroadenoma 246 days before the first control. The maximum difference in males was 5 times more deaths occurring during the 17th month in the group consuming 11% GM maize, and in females 6 times greater mortality during the 21st month on the 22% GM maize diet with and without R. In the female cohorts, there were 2–3 times more deaths in all treated groups compared to controls by the end of the experiment and earlier in general. Females were more sensitive to the presence of R in drinking water than males, as evidenced by a shorter lifespan. The general causes of death represented in histogram format (Fig. 1) are linked mostly to large mammary tumors in females, and other organic problems in males.  &gt;&gt;In all the dozen or so rodent toxicity studies, and the the 1,000+ animal studies lumped in as ""safety studies"" by the GMO PR machine, can you name a single study that found anomalous results that ever prompted a followup study with larger sample sizes?  &gt;My understanding is that follow up studies are done when anomalous results are obtained. According to this website: *""If the acute toxicity study yields adverse effects, then repeat dose toxicity studies are applied. ""*  &gt;http://enhs.umn.edu/current/5103/gm/risk.html     **Essay time:**  *As the website notes, the principle of ""substantial equivalence"" pervades any and all aspects of GMO safety testing. This means essentially that a GMO is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond  a shadow of a doubt. This reverses toxicological safety testing, which is more like high-level security clearance testing where one is presumed guilty of being a security risk until investigators can find otherwise.*   *In a normal, non-GMO-oriented 90-day rodent toxicology test,  researchers are looking for ANY deviation from the norm, however slight. They then evaluate the toxicological significance of that deviation, large or small, before clearing a substance for use. Under the principle of ""substantial equivalence,"" this is turned on its head: researchers are reluctantly allowed, though it is ""discouraged"" [though everyone, without exception, does it, some more creatively than others], to use ""auxiliary reference groups"" to establish a baseline of normalcy which is then used as a statistical arbiter that automatically has eliminated EVERY 90-day rodent toxicity study published by Monsanto from needing followup research.*  *The bottom line is that, due to the principle of ""substantial equivalence,"" such interesting statistical manipulations are built into the system, gaming, in  my opinion, the scientific method.*    &gt;I don't know of any specific studies that had follow up studies, however.  Let's play with probabilities. Assume that   we can use the same p value used in the studies themselves, p&lt;0.05, to decide whether or not a study, by random chance, should have automatically triggered a followup.  What are the odds that 1600 studies, with a 1/20 probability of having a false positive, would be performed without ever finding a false positive -- that is, without ever erroneously triggering the performance of a followup study...  It works out to  (0.95)^1600, I believe. That's a very, VERY small number, with a LOT of zeros after the decimal point, to indicate the probability that this has happened due to chance. Of course, my p value is possibly way too large, but just how small would it have to be for (1-p)^1600 to appear to be a plausible figure?  Do you see a possible indication of an industry-wide bias here? Do you see why anti-GMO forces might feel impelled to conduct obviously flawed studies in order to counter this not-so-subtle bias? .  **Of course, I may be wrong about any and all of the above, so take what I say with as many tons -- or worlds-full -- of salt as you deem necessary...** ",™

It's really not that common-- maybe once or twice in a game at the most, sometimes never. You'll see it a little more now Because It's The Cup™. But really, it's not immature at all. The bruisers on the team do it when it's the right time. Both sides know what's up.

We're talking about aborting fetuses, not murdering people.  You're right, that was overdramatic. Change ""put to death"" to ""aborted.""  &gt; It's not as if every child born with Downs Syndrome is sent off to a research hospital to help search for a cure.   We don't need *everybody* with DS to participate in research, but we need for there to be *some* people with DS to be able to continue with this research.  &gt; We understand Downs Syndrome and most forms of mental birth defects pretty well by now.   1. No we really don't. DS is tremendously complicated and we've only scratched the surface with what we could learn from studying it.  2. ""Mental birth defects"" is a very broad term. There are many, many conditions that we do not understand even as little as we understand DS. 3. I'm not just talking about developmental disabilities. I'm talking about how the study of these genetic conditions has advanced the whole field of genetics in significant ways.  &gt;&gt;     Many, many people with developmental disabilities work and contribute to the tax base.  &gt; Do they contribute more than they take?  I have no idea. It is completely possible. Your point in the first place was that it was ""nearly impossible"" for people with DD to contribute at all. I'm saying they contribute some, even if they don't make up the costs entirely. Futhermore, are you sure you contribute more than you take?   &gt;&gt;     families who have members with DS are proven to be happier  &gt; I don't believe this is true. I believe they don't want to admit how miserable they are so they lie to themselves on the survey.  [Source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.a.34293/abstract):  &gt; This study asks parents who have children with Down syndrome (DS) how they feel about their lives so that such information could be shared with expectant couples during prenatal counseling sessions. A valid and reliable survey instrument was mailed to 4,924 households on the mailing lists of six non-profit DS organizations. Of the 2,044 respondents, 99% reported that they love their son or daughter; 97% were proud of them; 79% felt their outlook on life was more positive because of them; 5% felt embarrassed by them; and 4% regretted having them. The parents report that 95% of their sons or daughters without DS have good relationships with their siblings with DS. The overwhelming majority of parents surveyed report that they are happy with their decision to have their child with DS and indicate that their sons and daughters are great sources of love and pride. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Approximately 1-mm thickness of cream was applied to each site and covered with Tegaderm® foam (3 M, St Paul, MN) placed directly over the site and then held in place with gentle wrapping of the pig with Tensoplast® elastic tape (BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany)  Seems like the tegaderm and tensoplast were for keeping the retinoid in place.  Still, I'd suggest talking to your derm or GP.  My nightly Retin-A/tretinoin soaks into my skin after a half hour or so, so I haven't considered using my 3M acne dressings (same tech as tegaderm, just precut circles) over tretinoin-treated skin to prevent tretinoin from rubbing off.  I have used tegaderm over a benzoyl-peroxide-treated pimple.  The pimple became cystic.  I wonder if the tegaderm's breathability was negated by BP, and without breathe, the pimple turned cystic.  The tegaderm instructions say to clean skin before using, so I've stuck with that now.  I'd be interested to know your results though!",®

t5_2rsjy,iKrissi,1371446507,"❤ I'm not sure how, but I became ""famous"" for wearing these cheap black rubber bracelets. I think I wore them first around the time Seesmic was big, when all of my favorite uber-nerdy friends were at #ACTB and #SXSW in 2009. I don't remember why, but I started giving away one or two to anyone in my group who wanted them.. and the trend caught on. It wasn't long before my friends (and sometimes random strangers who witnessed a bracelet exchange) started asking for them every time they saw me. Soon I was giving away all of the bracelets I had nearly every time I'd wear them.. which was fine, because I'd pop over to Hot Topic in my car and pick up new ones. However, when I moved to Manhattan I gave up my car and driving and couldn't find a store within practical walking/subway/bus distance to get my bracelet fix. Eventually, for a brief time last year, I ran out and didn't restock my supply.. I honestly thought it wouldn't matter, anyway. After that, when my friends saw me, their excitement quickly turned to disappointment as their outstretched arms awaiting a new circlet were met with emptiness from my own wrists. Their repeated lamenting over the absence of my black rubber turned into plots and schemes and resupply missions that were discussed at length every time I'd get together with anyone familiar with the strange little accidental tradition I'd started. Finally, at Jason's insistence, I found a website that sells them super cheap and I restocked.. buying not ten at a time, but two-hundred. There was grand celebration and much pomp over the reappearance of my bracelets and my friends were once again united by the el-cheapo fashion statement I didn't mean to start.   I love that my bracelets are now in at least 6 countries (and have traveled through more) and in many major cities across the US. I realized recently that the bracelet tradition is really about the reminder of a shared experience, a piece of a person we take with us, indeed a tangible thing we can carry from one day of our lives to the next that remind us who we've shared our lives with. I, too, have a few bits of material things that I always carry with me - a post-it-note from my son, a picture of Phil and his Ella, a prayer card a Shaolin monk gave me - and knowing I passed along this tradition, without even realizing it would become a tradition, fills me with joy. So, the next time you see me, make sure to ask for a bracelet or two... and then consider passing it on to someone else to spread the fun... I'll always give you another ❤",❤
t5_2qsto,iKrissi,1371447159,"❤ I'm not sure how, but I became ""famous"" for wearing these cheap black rubber bracelets. I think I wore them first around the time Seesmic was big, when all of my favorite uber-nerdy friends were at #ACTB and #SXSW in 2009. I don't remember why, but I started giving away one or two to anyone in my group who wanted them.. and the trend caught on. It wasn't long before my friends (and sometimes random strangers who witnessed a bracelet exchange) started asking for them every time they saw me. Soon I was giving away all of the bracelets I had nearly every time I'd wear them.. which was fine, because I'd pop over to Hot Topic in my car and pick up new ones.

Here are some of my favorite perks in descending order:  Cellular Telephone Protection If you pay your monthly cell phone bills with your Citi® credit card and your cell phone is damaged or stolen, you have supplemental insurance coverage that reimburses you for a replacement phone.  Extended Warranty The terms of the original manufacturers’ U.S. warranties (three year or less) may be extended up to one additional year on most items purchased on your card.  $0 Liability on Unauthorized Charges Shop anywhere and never lose a penny on unauthorized charges. With $0 Liability you won’t pay for any unauthorized charges made with your card.  Virtual Account Numbers Now, with Virtual Account Numbers you never have to give out your real credit card number online. With one click, you can generate a substitute credit card number and make it virtually impossible for anyone to steal your account number while shopping online.  Retail Purchase Protection Most items purchased with your Citi Card are eligible for protection against theft, fire or accidental breakage of up to $500 for up to 90 days from the date of purchase.

t5_2qhu8,Steam_Powered_Rocket,1371511768,"Okay -   The long answer is that you're mostly correct. Much of what the US is evaluating in current day is not the manufacturing techniques themselves, but the extent of utilization within the former Soviet state. Given the relative abundance of Ti within the Soviet Union at the time, the US intelligence community didn't have a strong grasp (as far as we know) on how much Ti alloys were used in production for Soviet military systems. Things like 'Is this made out of Ti?' 'How much of this is made out of Ti?' For many aerospace applications, it wasn't a question of whether or not a new airframe would use Ti, but to what extent the airframe would be constructed out of it. Although Ti is truly a wonder material and the russians had good technologies to work it, it still wasn't nearly as cost effective as steel for many applications. For other things, like engine parts, the question was whether or not Ti was used at all. Things like tank armor wouldn't make as much sense to make out of Ti, but changing steel valve heads in an engine for equivalent heads made out of titanium will vastly improve the run characteristics of a reciprocating (piston) engine.   As far as the actual working of the metal, much of what you hear has to do when a single pivotal event occurred where aero engineers needed a material with Titanium's specs. For this application, no other material would retain enough strength at temperature. This project, of course, is the development of the SR-71 blackbird.   There are a couple things that get passed around that enhance the mystique of titanium - first, that Kelly Johnson is quoted as saying that they produced parts that were too brittle to work, that the plates would begin to fracture when riveted too much. Fracture mechanics of metals is something that I actually touched on to a degree in another post a while ago [when discussing perception about brittleness versus materials strength.)(http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1emr9b/90s_earlier_technology_logic/ca1suo8) You have to keep in mind the not only was Kelly Johnson using this material that we had no manufacturing basis and limited knowledge basis of, but he was trying to produce something that hadn't been done before. In college, I worked on a set of CFD simulations to assist with an air force scramjet project. Something that I learned there is that when you get into the Mach 3+ regime, things get hot. Really hot. And the only way to deal with it is to use a material that can withstand that heat. Something that extreme tempered titanium alloy can do. Problem is, when you alloy something to withstand those temperatures, you get a material that is far more brittle than any kind of aerospace grade aluminum that's in, or that was in, general use. It's strong as hell and can meet the design specs of the flight regime, but try to rivet it like aluminum and it'll crack. Once you realize this about a material's properties, however, it's a relatively easy workaround. They tried to use the same bits, speeds, and feeds, (travel speed and RPM of the milling bit) when machining this as they did aluminum. You know how that went - bits were broken, cuss words were said. Finally, the welding required was basically argon TIG welding. Something that's pretty commonplace now, but it was expensive as hell at that point in time. All of this together would lead to a belief that the Soviets had a marked better manufacturing base for working with titanium. And to this point, they did. However, bear in mind that this was at the very beginning of the 60s.   The legacy of this program is the other side of my 'kind of' answer - prior to the production of the A-12 and SR-71, our capabilities with working titanium sucked. Seriously - we didn't know what we were getting into. At the same time, the knowledge base we produced in working with this, alongside the supply chain set up to procure the titanium through dummy corporations, allowed us to use our tech base to get our titanium metallurgy up to snuff.   I'm not just chest-beating with this one - with respect to US metallurgy, we've always been pretty damned good on the world stage. In the 1930s, we had working turbojet engines - courtesy of joint research with the British who'd had a patent laid out on the axial flow compressor turbine engine since 1929 or so. (Found it - 1930, Frank Whittle is the patent applicant) The U.S. had experimented with axial flow turbocores since 1936 or so, but abandoned them as being too costly for mass production given the strength, reliability, and economy of the piston engine. (If the development of the turbofan had come sooner, the project might not have been set aside at the beginning of the war. That's a conversation for another beer, though.) One of the reasons why the Me-262 and other German aircraft of WWII, and even some of the early Soviet jet engines were plagued with problems is because they'd effectively eat themselves. The turbine blades would begin to yield, fail, and blam. Engine full of shrapnel. U.S. metallurgy being what it was, we really didn't experience this problem (some people will bring up the P-80 shooting star and the death of Richard Bong in addition to a turbine blade failure suffered by Tony LeVier, one of the test pilots of that rig - the root cause of that was fuel pump failure, not the engine during normal spool up/spin down). Also, given that airframe range was a bigger consideration than most others, a jet didn't seem the way to go. Again, though - conversation for another beer. I could yak about that all day.   Tl;dr: They had a tremendous head start, but through good American ('MURICA ®) metallurgy research and the pioneering (for us) of the SR-71 project, we quickly caught up to the Soviet Union. It was both a question of utilization and ubiquity of titanium within the Soviet state. Once we established a supply of titanium in the early 60s, we were able to use it as well as they did. (After a hell of a lot of head scratching and 'Well, dammit' in the shop.)  Jeebus. I didn't mean to ramble so much. Let me know if you want to talk more about this - I could elaborate on a point or two if you've got more questions. I had the pleasure of having a good conversation with a fellow who used to work in Skunk works on this with respect to my source on a lot of the post-SR-71 project use and abilities on the part of the US. Most everything else I can point you to different sources on the web and in books.",®

t5_2qh8y,EMartinez86,1371514665,"For science:  &gt;When @NudesForTroops first starting tweeting at us, I thought it was a part of a government conspiracy to shutdown Sex.com. So did what I always do when the government tries to contact me, I ignore them.  &gt;However, the tweets kept coming. Eventually I realized that it probably wasn’t a government conspiracy. So I checked them out and it turns out they’re just a hard-working porno blogger just like me. Except for one difference, NudesForTroops.com is all about providing nudes for the troops. Strange right?  &gt;I sat down with the man behind NudesForTroops.com to find out more about his mission.  &gt;So here it is, the NudesForTroops.com interview: (my questions are in bold)  &gt;**The first thing I need to know about NudesForTroops.com is are you officially affiliated with the US military in any way?** No. I have a disclaimer on my site that states, “This site is not affiliated in anyway with any branch of the Armed Forces from any Country nor the DOD or Federal Agencies.”  &gt;**Were you ever in the military?**  &gt;It wouldn’t be inaccurate to assume that I couldn’t exactly not say that me being in the military isn’t partially incorrect. I’m possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea that in no way with any amount of uncertainty that I undeniably do or do not serve our country, if that indeed isn’t what I shouldn’t probably not be doing while running an adult website.  &gt;**Could you clear something up for me? Is it Troops submitting nudes or is it supporters of troops submitting nudes?**  &gt;I actually sent out a tweet about this the other day! Ha! My site is Nudes FOR Troops not Nudes OF Troops. I only wish to motivate, not exploit the men and women who serve our country.  &gt;However, soldiers are more than welcome to submit pics as well. I have a disclaimer on my site about that which states, “If you’re in the military and wish to submit pics we’d be more than happy to post them for you. However, keep in mind that you have UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) rules to follow. We highly suggest that you remove any name tags or unit badges or anything that might get you in trouble. We do not want to disrespect the uniform or what it represents in any way.”  &gt;Personally, I prefer non-military to send in pics of themselves wearing something military themed, draped in stars’n’stripes, or even saluting the camera! I also highly encourage people to send a message to the troops along with the pics that they submit because quite frankly, sometimes what’s written is just as morale boosting (if not more) than the pics themselves. It also connects on a deeper level and adds a feeling of personalization. When not in an area that restricts what can be viewed on the internet, a soldier can go to any website to get their fix. Often times, these sites have the same pics!  &gt;My vision for NudesForTroops is for it to be a place where soldiers can go to see pics that were taken FOR THEM. You know? Eventually, I’d like to have an International section where our Allies can get some love too. For now though, ‘MERICA! So far, we are not blocked in Afghanistan (I think that being a blog has something to do with it) and as always, nudity is NOT a requirement to be on our site. We welcome all couples, all colors, cam girls, guys, you name it.  &gt;**Why do you prefer non-military dressed up as military?**  &gt;I don’t want to encourage those serving to post pics on my site. The site was created for their viewing pleasure. I feel as if the focus of the site was for them to post pics that I would create a lot of disrespect towards the uniform and potentially ruin a lot of careers. You know how its cute when you wake up and some chick is wearing your shirt or your boxers? Its kind of like that. That’s what I’m aiming for. Besides, people love playing dress-up. No? Other than military themed/patriotic outfits and poses, I also encourage pictures with guns. We like guns. ☺ We’re really into Chivettes as well. I like their pg-13 style.  &gt;**What’s the origin story for your website?**  &gt;Adult websites were mostly blocked in Iraq. Troops would compile large amounts of pics and vids on external hard drives prior to deployment and swap spank-banks with each other so that we’d have new stuff to look at. Other than that, their only other options were Skype sex with some broad back home or the pg-13 pics that were posted in Facebook groups that would pop up like “Boobs 4 Vets” and “Kittens for Devil Dogs.”  &gt;Those Facebook groups are motivating. It does feel great to know that people back home are thinking of them. Sure, they got TONS of boxes of girl scout cookies and beef jerky, licorice, and all kinds of other goodies…not to mention random cards from churches and elementary schools. That stuff was great and is always appreciated by the troops. BUT, its a scientific fact that looking at a pair of tits lowers stress and promotes better health. I figured I wanted to do something to motivate the brothers and sisters that were still over there. So I created NudesForTroops.com. A place where people are not limited to posting PG-13 material on Facebook groups. A place where men and women can show their support in a different kind of way. Sending cookies just isn’t my style.  &gt;**Out of all the branches of the military, which would you say is the kinkiest?**  &gt;It’s known among all branches of the military that the Air Force typically has the hottest chicks. But kinkiest? I’d have to give that one to the men and women of the Army. (Maybe I’m a little biased) Also, support wise (on our site at least) the Army is kicking ass when it comes to the amount of pics submitted that are Army themed. The Marines are a close second.  &gt;**What is it about the AirForce that attracts the hottest chicks?**  &gt;I’m probably going to start a war among the branches now but… I assume it has something to do with how the chair-force, oops… I mean AIR Force uses their money. They usually have the best of everything from living quarters to chow halls, you name it, especially during deployment. So, the hottest girls go there because its easier? Hell, I don’t know. It’s just one of those facts of life. You know, like how the French suck. Boom.  &gt;**Am I correct in thinking that the military official’s stance on adult magazines, pictures, videos, whatever is that they aren’t permitted? Would morale improve if the troops were supplied by the military?**  &gt;You’re pretty correct on that. It really depends. Id, say… METT-TC (that’s a reference the military guys will understand). Back in the Vietnam days the military used to supply rations of beer to the soldiers. I know a few Cobra pilots who used to fly with beer! Over time, we learn what works and what doesn’t. Personally, I think things are fine the way they are, currently. Morale isn’t too bad, overall, that I know of. I’m just here to give a little extra.  &gt;**As you’ve already mentioned, NudesForTroops is a mix of found pics and fan submitted pics. What percentage of pics would you say are submitted?**  &gt;A good 85-90% of whats on the site has been user submitted. Can I verify that its original content? Nope. I wake up to emails/messages, I post them. OUILA! Every now and then I’ll post some pictures that I retweet on Twitter. The Twitter girls that we post either send me pics or tell me via Twitter that they’d like to be on the site. As for whats posted on Twitter, that’s usually pics that I’ve found here and there from various sites like, oh I don’t know, Sex.com. ☺ Twitter is a chess game, really. It’s strategy. There’s a method to the madness regarding what and who gets re-tweeted. At the end of the day, the women who I give love to on Twitter are usually the ones who have personalized pics and messages for the troops.  &gt;**I really appreciate that you have sections For the Fellas and For the Ladies. However, most women aren’t visual stimulated like men. Given the stress and the circumstances of serving, do the ladies appreciate the nudes as much as the fellas?**  ",☺

When will you be in?""  (3k did not have a car, and generally either rode the bus or had a roommate drive him to work.)  *3k*:  ""I don't exactly know.  My roommate is having some kind of meltdown and locked me out of the house.""  (At that point, I heard a shrill female voice in the background screaming:  ""He hit me!  That F@(/&amp;$ hit me!

I recited our attendance policy (as remembered off the top of my head when jolted suddenly awake by a phone call), advised him to get to work as quickly as possible, get myself dressed, and rush to work.

t5_2qi0a,wadcann,1371533050,"[Reposting my post from the last time this was asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11v69k/using_a_guns_name_in_your_video_game/c6q00vq).  &gt; I'm not a lawyer, but: &gt;  &gt; [Using the Trademarks of Others](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others): &gt;  &gt; &gt;* Nominative Fair Use: The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims. Some examples of nominative fair use include a newspaper's use of the ""New Kids on the Block"" trademark to create and report on polls asking readers questions about the musical group's popularity; another newspaper's use of the trademark ""Boston Marathon"" in order to report on the sporting event; and a photographer's use of ""Barbie"" dolls in parody photographs that criticized Mattel's famous toy and the values she represents. Another example from our database is law blogger Eric Turkewitz's use of the Avis and Hertz logos in a blog post about a lawsuit involving these two companies. (Note, however, that there is some question about whether using a logo, rather than just a textual reference, would qualify as a fair use under the three-part test outlined above.) &gt;  &gt; also: &gt;  &gt; &gt;First Amendment Defenses: Courts have recognized a number of additional ""First Amendment"" defenses in particular situations. For example, in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a filmmaker could use Ginger Rogers' trademark (her name) in the title of a film called ""Ginger and Fred,"" even though the film was not primarily about Rogers. The court indicated that trademark law should be applied to artistic works ""only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" The specific details of these defenses is beyond the scope of this guide; the point to keep in mind is that courts may act to protect your right of free expression even if what you are doing doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories above. &gt;  &gt; My own view, which is not informed by any specific case history and is not that of a lawyer, is that it's probably fine. &gt;  &gt; At the end of the day, trademarked products are part of our society and culture.  The point of a trademark isn't to keep you from *talking* about something, but to keep you from *misrepresenting* yourself as being the creator of a production.  Avoiding misrepresentation is essential to permit building reputation.  Building reputation is important for our markets to function, for people to be able to choose to purchase products from someone who they have been happy with in the past. &gt;  &gt; If it's illegal for someone else to sell cereal under the name ""Wheaties"", as trademark law provides, then people can build up reputation associated with those Wheaties and know that, for example, cereal sold as ""Wheaties"" means that a product is of high quality and is satisfactory. &gt;  &gt; But that doesn't mean that you can't write a book or have a reality TV show or so forth in which the main character eats Wheaties for breakfast.  It's obvious there that the reality TV show isn't part of the Wheaties product line. &gt;  &gt; Now, all that being said, there should also be no possibility of confusion that the owner of the trademark is endorsing your own product.  A standard legal CYA (probably not necessary for the use you're making, but strengthens a legal position by providing an argument) may be to include the boilerplate stuff that you [may have seen on ads or other things that reference trademarks of someone else](http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/fair-play/): &gt;  &gt; &gt; ""LEGO®is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site"".  &gt;  &gt; I probably wouldn't list the ""Colt Bushmaster"" on the packaging or wherever where you don't want to make that disclaimer available without a purchase; again probably not a hard requirement, but strengthens your legal position.  And I would not use the Colt logo in the description, but simply the text.  You're simply describing a real-world gun to the user, and you need to use the text to make it clear which you are talking about. &gt;  &gt; The only minor point of confusion — and I'm not familiar with the case law here — is that there *are* license games that *do* specifically enjoy being able to claim that they are endorsed by the licensee, especially sports games and (closer to this) driving games, to the point that driving games routinely *do* license the car.  Whether-or-not requiring driving licenses would hold up in court, Ferrari *has* C&amp;Ded game creators who [don't have licenses](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/2115416771.shtml).  Note that Ferrari can claim whatever they want; just because Ferrari does this doesn't mean that they would prevail in a lawsuit.  But I suspect that most people don't want to hassle with Ferrari on the point of a lawsuit. &gt;  &gt; There have been numerous commercial games in the past, like *Jagged Alliance 2*, which have referenced many weapons, and I strongly doubt that they went out to gun manufacturers and tried to get licenses. &gt;  &gt; EDIT: Please note that I am referring to law in the United States.  If you're dealing with some different jurisdiction, I've no idea how closely things run to the US. ",®

t5_2qh1i,thatfatgamer,1371550893,"When I used to work for Dominos® UK  A fat lady and her kids popped in-store to get a pizza. The Lady's kid ordered a large pizza (might be Meast Feast); When the pizza was made, the kid collected the pizza and walked out of the store with the lady.  A few minutes later, the lady returned with the pizza furious, dropped it on the counter yelling at me (because I took the order). She said the kid ordered a large pizza and I cheated them and gave them a regular pizza. I was like ""WTF?"" I checked the contents of the pizza, a slice was half eaten, but rest assure that the pizza contents and size were right.  I then proceeded to show her the different boxes we use for different size of pizzas and she insisted that I am hiding the large boxes. I then asked her, ""Ma'am, what makes you think that this pizza is not large?"" She then replied that the toppings were not full (which was bullshit; as we fucking count the toppings while placing them) and the box had regular written over it.

t5_2spqb,deten,1371558698,"&gt;will... destroy evil forever at some point in the future  Ahh yes, the infamous Soon™.  I get why its allowed, but it gets cheap when Jesus says there are people living today (2000 years ago) who will see it, and you have to admit that Jesus was deliberately misleading as the only excuse. (Matthew 16: 27, 28)  &gt;Evil is not something God intended for this world  So something occurred that was not intended? He is not all powerful... or it was intended, and therefore he is cruel.  &gt;Man knew the penalty for disobeying God  This is so utterly not true its not even funny how not true it is. What you are saying is that God made man to fail, then put them to test, and they failed, now we are all going to hell unless we beg to be forgiven for something that God destined us to do anyways.  Also he loves us, and thats why were going to burn in hell. Not to mention that Adam and Eve had no concept of Good and Evil, which makes it impossible to hold them accountable for an action, since god didnt decide they should understand what good and evil was.  &gt;Already explained above. Both able and willing according to christian scripture.  I wouldn't say explained, more like excused.  You have found a way to excuse your religion, while holding other religions accountable to the same standards you have found a way to weasel out your own from.  Theres no reason why other religions cannot say the same thing you did, then claim that you must have faith... and theres no way to distinguish between them.   **Edit** Bring on the delicious downvotes",™

t5_2fwo,flying-sheep,1371567442,"&gt; Spotify supports unicode usernames which we are a bit proud of (not many services allow you to have ☃, the unicode snowman, as a username). However, it has also been a reliable source of pain over the years.  the problem here is that they canonicalize strings with a fancier system than `my_str.lower()` because it “creates confusion” if OHM SIGN ≠ GREEK LETTER OMEGA (or whatever). `.lower()` is idempotent (= can be applied to its result without changing it), while  &gt; We were relying on nodeprep.prepare being idempotent, and it wasn’t.  but my problem with this: why does it “create confusion”? if a user knows how to input omega, he won’t accidentally input ohm, so i fail to see the problem that would have arised if they’d just used `.lower()`.",☃

t5_2qj8f,FredJoness,1371573425,"&gt;That's the point though [see below] as the ""science"" is stacked against the anti-GMO forces so tactics that involve creative use of scientific [sorta] studies can bring PR pressure to bear on the Forces of Darkness™...   Martin Luther King used asymmetric warfare and nonviolent civil disobedience to create publicity.  But he never **lied** or deliberately deceived people to gain publicity.  He knew if he was caught lying, it would **irretrievably ruin his cause.**   When I read Seralini's study, the first thing that hits me is his large pictures of tumors caused by GMO food and Roundup.  But when I look for a p-value, I see that **he deliberated left this out.**  He left it out because the study is not statistically significant.  The findings are consistent with the null hypothesis that the tumors are random events.   Sprague Dawley rats over 6 months get lots of spontaneous tumors.     Seralini knows damn well that he should have calculated a p-value, and he knows damn well he is doing bad science and deceiving people.  He gets up publicly and claims he has done a good study, and he knows he is lying.  From a legal point of view, he is committing **fraud,** a felony.  It would seem his University should fire him rather to continue to employ a felon.   It would seem at this point we **cannot trust anything** Seralini does.  If he comes out with a highly statistically significant study in the future, we cannot trust him, because a known liar could be creating false data.  (Maybe I am a little to harsh here, but can you argue he has not committed fraud?)   &gt;Here's the pattern of tumor development that Saralini's group found.    Seralini didn't find anything.  It was already know that Sprague-Dawley rats get lots of tumors after 6 months.  His findings were consistent with the null hypothesis  that Sprague-Dawley rats randomly develop tumors, since the results were not statistically significant.  If Seralini's study was statistically significant, I could see possibly running a follow up study, but it wasn't.   &gt;Let's play with probabilities. Assume that..   I have taken several course on statistics in college, and used to do statistics runs  for a large cancer organization.  I am well aware that in a large number of studies, some should come up as false positives, and these should have had follow up studies.  However you have not provided my with a **link** proving that there has been 1600  GMO studies and none of them had a follow up.  Provide me with a good link and you will convince me.   &gt;In a normal, non-GMO-oriented 90-day rodent toxicology test, researchers are looking for ANY deviation from the norm, however slight. They then evaluate the toxicological significance of that deviation, large or small, before clearing a substance for use. Under the principle of ""substantial equivalence,"" this is turned on its head: researchers are reluctantly allowed, though it is ""discouraged"" [though everyone, without exception, does it, some more creatively than others], to use ""auxiliary reference groups"" to establish a baseline of normalcy which is then used as a statistical arbiter that automatically has eliminated EVERY 90-day rodent toxicity study published by Monsanto from needing followup research.    The bottom line is that, due to the principle of ""substantial equivalence,"" such interesting statistical manipulations are built into the system, gaming, in my opinion, the scientific method.    This is interesting.  Could you provide a link discussing this in more detail? ",™

t5_2vzvv,fb95dd7063,1371580684,"Alright it's lunch time so i'll do my best to power through this thing.   &gt;One of the main tenets of red pill understanding is that the dating/mating/marriage market is considerably broken. Now, on /r/theredpill[1] , you probably hear guys bitch and moan because men's and women's mating strategies are at odds with eachother. They are, kinda.  Pretend that David Attenborough is reading this and you'll realize how ridiculous it sounds.   &gt;Here's the quick and dirty: We all have biological imperatives that our brains are programmed to try to make us accomplish in order to find happiness. The good news is, we're not slaves to the drive, and once we understand the drive we can be proactive to either satisfy the urge, or change our goals to mitigate it.  Sure, some biological urges exist. Let's see where this is going...  &gt;A man's biological imperative is to procreate. Some men (the few-- less than 20%) are very attractive to women and **may take on as many partners as he can.**   ... Oh. So this unsourced BioTruth™ is effectively the fundamental basis  of literally everything that follows. The TL;DR version of it being ""MEN HAVE SEX = GOOD. WOMEN HAVE SEX = BAD.""   &gt;there's no telling if he'll stick around to help with the young, but rest assured he'll make the rounds. **Other men aren't as attractive are happy being providers.** This is a majority of men. They want to settle down, have a family. **Their biological impulses, believe it or not, is to make a woman happy.**   Unsourced assertion which forms the underlying premise for the entire ideology. Without anything to prove this, there's literally no reason to believe anything the rest of the post has to say. Regardless, moving on...  &gt;It's both a feature, and as we've discovered on /r/theredpill[2] , one of man's biggest weaknesses.  Wanting to settle down and have a family is one of man's biggest weaknesses, according to Red Pill Theory. K.  &gt;A woman's biological imperative is to procreate. (We're not so different!) Her strategy is slightly different. She wants provisions, but she also wants the highest quality DNA to procreate with.  Pretend David Attenborough is reading this too. That said, it sounds like he's saying that 'women want an attractive man'. I suppose that's accurate, as attractiveness is subjective; though I imagine he'd disagree.  &gt;Unfortunately for guys, this sometimes ends up with women having sex with one of the attractive but noncommittal men, and then finding another man to do the provisioning. Her strategy is two-fold: have sex with the highest value males as possible, and get commitment from the highest value males possible.  *What?* This literally ignores that women have sex simply because they enjoy it. It also implies that the majority attractive men are intrinsically noncommittal. Here's some classic TRP misandry right here. It also relies on a particular standard of attractiveness: which is absurd as attractiveness *objectively* varies between cultures and time periods; indicating that much of it is a social construct.  &gt;The reason for this drive for the absolute best DNA is because the biological cost for women is higher than men when making babies. It's a 9-month + many year expenditure. For men, it's about 15-seconds to half an hour (or longer if you're lucky, bow chicka wow ow).  Naturally that means women cannot afford to ""accidentally"" end up with somebody of lower caliber, as this takes up precious time and resources that could be dedicated to higher caliber DNA.  Again, this relies on the first unsourced premise. It also relies on the drive for sex being procreation. This is unsourced garbage is flawed because if it were true: people wouldn't masturbate. The existence of it shows that perhaps it's more complicated than women craving some Alpha DNA.  &gt;This strategy, which is mainly unconscious, is called hypergamy: maximizing rejections to reach the best quality males as possible.  Evo-psych psudeoscience.   &gt;Now, these imperatives we speak about here aren't set in stone, some have stronger instincts than others, and all men and women have the free will to ignore them.  Convenient.  &gt;You don't have to give in to your biological imperatives. But know that left unchecked, most men and women will act on these imperatives without realizing it- causing visible trends that are easy to spot if you know what you're looking for.  Confirmation Bias.  &gt;So Why Red Pill Women? Isn't the red pill all misogynistic and stuff?  Who knows? Yes, it is.  &gt;It isn't.  [It is.](\http://www.reddit.com/r/Game0fDolls/comments/1gd3wi/why_the_manosphere_exists/caj3o7j?context=3)   &gt; The red pill is about accepting reality for what it is.   No, it's about constructing one and letting confirmation bias prove it for you.  &gt;...and a lot of men on /r/theredpill[3] are a bit angry.  You don't say?   &gt;They're angry because they spent a majority of their lives being told that this isn't reality, and putting them at a severe disadvantage.  No, they're angry because it took them so long to find a world view which reinforces their self-evident beliefs that they're entitled to sex and that it's the fault of feminism that they aren't getting laid.  &gt;Once we embrace what reality is, we find our relationships to be more successful, more fulfilling, and a better deal for ourselves and for the women we've dated.  Yeah, women love to be told that they're incapable of intellectual self-critical thought. They have a word for this, you know. ""Hamstering"". They say that women self-rationalize their 'bad behavior' is like a hamster in a wheel.  &gt;Well, the past half a century was the march of feminism telling women that they don't need to do anything for men, that they are perfect and don't need to change, that change or compromise is oppression, and that you can have it all.   Yeah bro, that's what feminism is. Better tell Judith Butler right away.    Anyways, that's all I have time for right now. Maybe I'll get to the rest later.  ",™

t5_2rxrw,leeceia,1371614628,"I find a lot of nerd culture is boring, expensive and time consuming. It's exclusive, frequently hostile, filled with a lot of obsessives, and very unwelcoming.   For others, that's ok, I just don't get it at all, and people harassing you to get to like them is annoying (that's just from experience). There's also loads of elitism and sexism in those communities. The costuming of female characters games is frustrating, and in stuff like GTA it's all ""let's beat the hookers up lol"". I've attended a couple of university groups focused on those interests and people didn't even look at me, and were really rude. They only ever spoke to my boyfriend, they didn't even address me even if it was in reference to both of us (also we were both new to the group so there was no reason why they would ignore me). I don't know if that's actually sexist or just a failing of social skills but it's incredibly nasty. Even the other women wouldn't address me, or they were blatantly using the guys to get what they want (I'm talking money, food, whatever). And they were so determined not to be feminine but dying to be paid attention to by the better looking guys that it was painful.   It also feels incredibly childish. A lot of it is literally for children, shit like pokemon and my little pony. That is what I grew up with and seeing fully grown adults becoming obsessed with it and fawning over it like teenagers at a Bieber concert grosses me out. It just feels like they hated their painful adolescence so much they reverted to shit from their childhood. (Yeah, sorry, got a little angry there). But in all seriousness, I was at my uni, the best in the country, and a 22 year old woman couldn't use correct grammar because it was all ""can I haz"". FFS. At least speak like an adult.   Also I just find it ugly. To be clear, I'm talking design, not people. Steampunk looks grotty (IMO) and doesn't suit a majority of people. I don't like the majority of stylings for sci-fi, I don't like the design of the majority of anime, I don't like way people try to bring it out into the real world. Even if it is beautifully designed within it's format, it doesn't always transfer well. I can't stand the ""Look what I did, /r/gaming, I made a zelda/pokemon/half life/portal blah blah blah"". I can respect the skill and passion, but it's so ugly. Don't even get me started on the gamer weddings! Hideous. ***But again, it's 400% their life, they should have it exactly as they want, and I'm not trying to say my opinions should affect them, which is why I'm normally totally silent on these kind of discussions.***   And everyone has the opinion that you're shit if you're not interested in their niche, or if you don't know as much as them about a topic. Like jeez I'm sorry I can't remember exactly what scene that was quoted from, or that minor plot point, ahhh look it's the end of the world. It just feels like for a lot of people, it's not an interest, it's a way of life™. And that to me is crazy. I'm probably going to change my tastes along the line, no point deciding which nerdy costumes I'm going to put my kids in for halloween or which gaming characters will adorn their walls. It's irrational and likely unsustainable for the majority of people. For me, obsessiveness is actually a bit of a red flag. The intensity that some people get around this sort of stuff can be totally scary. It also means (at least in my experience) some don't like to venture out or they look down on other interests.   It's also a major time sink. I have a couple of friends studying game design at university and their job outlooks are pretty fucking minimal. They don't even do well because they're too busy playing the games. And it's frustrating because you do want them to do well but they don't want to step out of that comfort zone. It's almost painful. Just seeing how skinny and underdeveloped and pale and unhappy one of my friends is is really quite worrying, he just has the body of a twelve year old because he never does anything. His mother is begging me to help him get out of the house. At 21. It's really really saddening.   Really long, but yeah. That's why. ",™

t5_2qh03,thecraw2k,1371663637,"As a owner of both 360/PS3 I will get the Xbone and PS4 later for exclusive titles as I have done with this current generation systems.  Both systems are great but I prefer MS interface by far! out of the two I use my xbox as my default system, when a title comes out that is available on both consoles I will get the xbox version.  Well at first I was upset about all the restrictions that MS put on the Xbone, I almost grabbed my Sony pitchfork to join the mob, it was a easy temptation to drink the haterade and stick my nose in the lemmings ass in front of me and jump off the Sony cliff riding the PS4 karma bandwagon, but I decided to sit down and calmly examine how this would really affect me.  Cons:  24hour check-in: Yes this is dumb and could have been handled better, I can see why they would do this with the the cloud based sharing/gaming option. So I thought how this would REALLY bother me, but both my system have been online  since I bought them so in reality for me this is NOT an issue (might be a inconvenience if my internet happens to go down for 24hours which has never happened) I can always tether for the check-in if it is necessary.  Used game sales: I have never sold any of my games or bought any used games for that matter so although I would have liked to have this option it would not really affect me.  Big brother Kinect: I already have a kinect on my current 360 so I am used to having it, MS already said you CAN disable the video, so screw you PRISM you can not record me in my underwear with one hand on my junk and the other on a bottle of JOHNSON'S® NATURAL® Baby Lotion.  Price: Yes cheaper is better cant argue that, but for people like me who will end up with both systems saving $100 would be great but it isn't going to kill me.    Pros:  Cloud based system: Well now on the other side of the  24hour check-in coin, this is actually pretty damn cool feature, the fact that I can access my games from any Xbone console, or more importantly I can share my library with my friends and family and vice-Versa . Think about how convenient and cost saving  this will be if you can share your purchases with 10 other people you will have access to 10 other peoples gaming library in essence your gaming buying power will be increased by 10x  TV integration: well this is a cool feature, I am sure I will use but I am not really sold on this yet, not until I get some actual hands on and see how it goes.  Improved Multi tasking:  being able to switch between my game and TV and having instant sounds like a very nice option but again this sounds good on paper lets see how well it works in RL.  2 free games a month:  This is a cool added benefit, I've been paying for xbox gold for about 10 years now and its about time they offered something back. and being able to share my gold account with my family is nice benefit I could never justify buying multiple gold accounts so people can use online features on the SAME console.   So in the end I will have both the Xbone and PS4 but I will get the Xbone 1st and the PS4 later for its exclusives. Afterall both consoles have exclusive titles that justify owning both. If you want me I will be trying to complete ""The last of us""   ",®

Although your wave may initally be in a more defensive location, it is impossible to keep it that way without your opponent intervening (minion genocide), minion aggro from AAs or minions just being inconsistent.  If you were to disrupt the ""non-first"" minions then that would likely lead to the desired result of minions dying slightly slower and more painful deaths at the hand of their evil cousins.  Whether it's a worthwhile investment (assuming you don't need to help your friendly jungler)  I'm not sure, especially considering basically any trading in lane will probably influence the flow of the minion waves moreso than simply being a meanie and getting in their way.

I'd say I consider myself an egalitarian or humanist (Or just simply say I treat everyone equally, and with an equal amount of respect...At least until they show me that they are, or are not worthy of respect).

There's a lot of crooks who lobby to deregulate their industries so they can lower security standards, anti-pollution measures and generally treat their workers and customers worse.  That said...  The older I get, the less left-leaning I get. I don't think marxism is necessarily the *One True Way*™  to a better society. I don't think capitalism is, either.

It is no longer compatible with version 0x42 save files. ◾The ""Load Character"" dialog now displays characters from both the ""\save"" and ""\modsave"" directories, and indicates which directory each character is from. ◾The preview panel now displays whether a character is modded or not. ◾Added support for new pets: Panda, Alpaca, Stag, and Headcrab.  ◦MOD SUPPORT! Torchlight 2 Rapid Respec is now compatible with many mods, and even modded classes! In order to configure Torchlight 2 Rapid Respec to be compatible with your mods of choice, please follow the instructions in the mod compatibility guide. If you find the mod compatibility configuration too complicated or difficult, you can download configuration files from other users. ◦New features to strip mod bindings and remove mods from your character's mod history. ◦The pet type change feature is expanded to include fish transformations. ◦New pet scale change feature allows you to change your pet's size. Ever wanted a chakawary the size of Godzilla? Now you can have one. ◦Better handling of the confusing extra pathnames in the Steam version of Torchlight 2. ◦Torchlight 2 Rapid Respec nows comes with a Windows installer/uninstaller. The installer should solve a lot of installation and configuration problems. A .7z archive is still available for those who prefer it to the installer. ◦The spell respec tab is now disabled by default. This feature always behaved erratically, and duplicating spells/tomes in StashNinja is frankly a better and less risky method. If you really want to use this feature, it can be activated in the options menu. ◦Reworked build codes to support the potential additional data requirements for mods. Build codes no longer contain spell respec information. ◦Dead hardcore characters are now revived with their base health rather than a flat 100 health. ◦Fixed a bug with the program hanging during update check if no internet connection/connection problem. The update check will now always timeout correctly. ◦Numerous revisions to the help file, including a mod compatibility guide.  •Version 1.05: Added support for new Badger and Owl pets. •Version 1.04: ◦New feature: Added cheat option to change death count. ◦Another bugfix for ""Parse Error: Never found huge pre-pet FF block"" for some high-level characters. Bug should be really, completely dead this time. ◦Fixed bug that caused brown bulldog and brown ferret to be detected as ""unknown pet.""  ",◾

Plasti Dip® is extremely resistant to the elements, including sun fading, winter ice, cold, salt ect.  A lot of customers actually dip their wheels and cars specifically to protect the    original surfaces from the winter season.    - Will it hold up to heat and racing?  Plasti Dip® is heat resistant up to 312 degrees F.  Dipped wheels have a great record holding up to the heat and abuse from racing or rally events.    That sounds good enough for me.

Is ""Steam preorder"" a 'program' like 'Early Access'? Could you, under the 'Steam preorder program', have offered the full game with upgrade/edition options for beta access in September and alpha access in June? For example, Payday 2's store page went live at the end of May, and they have a higher priced tier that permits access to a beta roughly 4 to 8 weeks before the game's release in mid/late August. All the while they have staff &amp; VIPs already playing the game via Steam, of course. So essentially that's three tiers, even though the 'alpha' tier isn't sold. Tons of other games have had deluxe editions with beta access. Is their problem that you sell alpha and beta in separate packages, or is the issue that you joined Early Access™ and can't get out again?",™

t5_2qhw1,aim2free,1371695401,"&gt; Linksys was sold by Cisco to Belkin a few months ago.  Whoops, that was even worse than I could imagine, [I found this article](http://www.techhive.com/article/2026238/cisco-to-sell-linksys-home-networking-business-to-belkin.html)  I definitely defintely do not like this:  _Cisco Systems plans to sell its Linksys home networking business to Belkin International for an undisclosed sum under an agreement that **includes cooperation between the companies on software, service-provider products and other areas**._  but thanks for the info❣  &gt; Also... How many Cisco certs do you have? Zero?  WTF has that to do with anything? Why would there be any reason for me to have a Cisco cert??? I'm not using their products, I'm not interested in using their products, and I will never buy their products, especially of the reasons mentioned.  What I was teaching about networking was basic stuff, routing, name servers, dhcp, layers which is all you need to know for most normal networking.(but that was of course in the Linux lab I set up, as such things were not possible to do on the school computers due to too despotic ""security"" and the VLAN which we had no way of accessing in any way, as I said, with tremendous bureacracy and complaints we succeded to make them open port 21 to the outside after 2 months. But access to the VLAN settings, impossible, no way. Not even the schools IT responsible had any way of accessing/changing anything there.  I'll likely never in my life setup a VLAN, despite I acknowledge VLAN to be useful for places like huge datacenters, colocation centers and such, but I prefer simple networking using either the OSI layers or the TCP/IP layers model, which is very intuitive and simple.  However, as the internet is more or less destroyed nowadays I'm seeing that we need to quickly develop better alternatives, using a type of protocol which I proposed 1987, which is completely independent of ISPs, can not be tracked, supervised or controlled by anyone, and is universal, ane neither bound to this planet only.  It's actually completely ridiculous, when you think about it. Why the heck did they make MAC addresses with 48 bits, which were unique for the whole planet, but only useful for local lan, then upon that put a shitty protocol with only 32 bits, which should work for the whole planet... They could simply have skipped the IP level and you would have had a working global protocol, but people who have grown up with these 7 layer of the OSI or the 4 layers of the TCP/IP are most likely too brainwashed to think about the problems and extra control and supervision possibilities they imply.  Of course the protocol then would look somewhat different but not much different.  The protocol I proposed in 1987 used 64 bits for identity and 64 bits for surface (planet and such) and was community routed. And... ipv6 never became what I first had hoped for, it's too much control builtin also there, bad design.  The problem in my case when teaching was that someone else had control over the VLAN settings for the school network, and it was an impossible bureucracy. As I said, it took as much as two months just to make them open up port 21 (I had already quickly solved that particular problem by setting up an ssh/sftp server on the public network on port 8080, to be able to teach  at all). I.e the only course I could run on the schools locked in Windows machines were webdesing. All other stuff in Linux labs which I setup myself.",❣

I actually tried another way after that, That was to connect all the windows computers (around 20) through a NAT-router because then they would be able to see my server (for necessary software share as well as http/ftp server) but then the students were of course not able to login in onto the computers as they used network login which didn't accept logins from a guest network, well the login server wasn't even seen from the guest network :-) Of course that was a desperate attempt, but I could at least make a few nice sarcastic photos and drawings for my presentation and my report.

If we replace the word ""religious"" with ""divine and mystical"", then you and I are 100% on the same page. Until then, I have to say that religion appears far too cultic and dogmatic to supersede the rational mind which should rightly seek to subject or question it (again, IMHO of course).   To me, there is a very large gap between leaps of faith with experiences of intuition-based, irrational, soul-evolution/growth and believing every single facet of a scripture and a religious teaching. They are very different leap-of-faith creatures, if you will.   Knowing that something is a contradictory paradox surely doesn't prove it false, but might we agree that it proves it far from indubitable, neatly organized and natural truth, as it is usually presented?

t5_2qh5b,comehitherhitler,1371699682,"Allow me to expand on your analogy. I'm going to assume the bridge represents some form of birth control, and pose the idea that trying to leap across the same span would represent completely unprotected sex.  You and a friend are hiking a trail that winds through a canyon and need to cross a chasm to continue on. You are of the wise opinion that falling into the chasm would be doubleplusungood. Attempting to leap the chasm is a bad choice. You might make it, but it's highly likely that even if you do you will break your legs landing on the other side, which is very rocky and uneven. You notice a nearby rope bridge and decide that it would be a safer option for crossing the gap. You realize that it could break under your party's combined weight, but this is a very remote possibility - after all millions of people hike this trail every day without incident. Your friend reassures you that nothing could possibly go wrong: neither of you wants to fall into the chasm, your friend has taken this bridge before and can attest to its resilience, and, furthermore, they've been cutting back on Big Macs should this very situation arise! With newfound confidence you and your friend boldly step out onto the bridge. At this point we have several scenarios to consider:  1. You make it halfway across the bridge, at which point it collapses at both ends! You and your friend are trapped at the bottom of the chasm for 270 days living on nothing but dry Top Ramen and realizing that you don't particularly like each other after all. 1. You make it halfway across the bridge, at which point your friend shoots you a devious smile and begins jostling the bridge! You feel the icy hand of betrayal giving you an atomic wedgie as you and your friend fall straight into Ramenville, as you come to call it around day 102.  1. You make it across the span safely. Hooray! Your friend then handcuffs themself to you, pirouettes, and leaps majestically into the depths all the while cackling maniacally. Soon you cease to be yourself. All you know and all you are is the Noodle. 1. You make it across the span safely. Hooray! Your friend then informs you that they've hiked this trail with *much* cooler people - people who could leap the chasm from a standing position all day and night. You part ways on acrimonious terms, but years later you will look back on the experience from your office at the top of Nissin Foods headquarters in beautiful Osaka, Japan and consider yourself richer for having gone through it.  Addenda:  * *Your friend* has all the travel gear in their pack and can choose to use it at any time or not to use it at all while you two are trapped. It includes: a radio, which can be used to call for help and has about 3 days of battery life left; climbing equipment, which can be used to hoist the two of you out to safety within the next six months (after that point you've both eaten so much T.R.™ that the equipment can no longer support your weight); and a priceless, hand-drawn map, which was traded to you by a local village elder on the condition that you immediately return it to the village should you ever follow its marked path leading out of the chasm. *Your* pack is full of nothing but instant noodles. Someone has played a cruel, cruel joke upon you.  * You **cannot** leave the chasm without your friend, but if they decide to escape using any available method you have no choice but to follow.  * Please note that the wants and needs of the innocent chasm are not addressed in this analogy - only the choices and actions of the hikers.  Before anyone says anything, yes, I used the ""[Epicene they](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)"" and I did so with malice aforethought.",™

I just mentioned two annoyances in one message.  If I had been able to access the settings of the VLAN in that case it would not have been a problem. The problem was that all such settings were completely unavailable for anyone at the school, as I said it took two months and plenty of bureacracy to get the ""Gods"" just to open up port 21, which was only a subtle subproblem, which I could easily solve by setting up an ssh server on an external server on port 8080, as only 8080, 80 and 443 were open.. The school was forced into a despotic policy which made their network setup useless for educational purposes.",❣

Well to create efficient advertising Facebook mines your content, even your personal private stuff. We believe that your precious content should be in a place without intrusive adverts flashing around it, and without your content being sold. We always say “Your content is yours, and remains yours in hiyalife” The control and choice elements of hiyalife are key too.   You choose who can see your memories and, if someone shares a memory with you, you choose whether you’d like to add it to your story or not.  The fact we have a timeline might immediately make you think of facebook, but it’s the most logical way to organise moments from your life, and our emphasis is on reliving past moments and not on the “NOW” of facebook.  We’re different, your memories become a legacy that can be passed on, but only to those you allow to see them, you choose and control what’s yours, and can share memories online with those you shared the memory with offline.   We think all these things combined make hiyalife something that’s used in a different way to facebook, current users seem to agree...

t5_2qh26,epicde,1371731116,"Thank you ☺ We could name a fair few problems, but the key one is the fact that precious content (photos, videos, stories) is currently scattered all over the place.

t5_2qh26,epicde,1371731200,"@cmdrNacho Thanks so much for your feedback. Very glad you like the design and as you say, there are lots of challenges ahead too...  The fact the site is very slow to load is something we know about and are working hard to improve. Sorry, I know it’s currently frustrating.  The central differences between hiyalife and facebook are in the fact that the user has control of privacy and choice of content. Also in that we don’t have advertising in our model, which means you own your own data and won’t have to suffer from intrusive adverts. (I’ve explained this in far more details in response to below questions that were more focussed on Facebook... in case you’d like to read more!)  Lots of what you highlight is part of our on-going mission to improve user flow. We’re focussed on this so fingers crossed that soon hiyalife will be both slick AND user friendly!  We want to make it as easy and fun to get started as possible. Creating a memory at the start is a very different idea that’s definitely worth us discussing, so thanks for that. ☺ ",☺

Maxwell Jr.  ""The dialogue below is an example of the Socratic method applied to a modern topic. In this Socratic Dialogue, a Christian preacher states the often claimed idea that atheists cannot be moral because faith in God is the basis of morality. The Socratic Method is used to question this idea in a way that demonstrates it is not religious faith, but secular knowledge that is needed in order to carry out moral deeds and to interpret moral principles. This dialogue is not intended as an attack on faith, but merely to address one mistake within modern religious thought. I have used such questions in real conversations. Although the verbal maneuvering of the respondents vary tremendously, the end result is the same as the dialogue you read below.  That end result is the inability of religious persons to give one example of faith being able to carry out moral deeds or interpret moral principles without the assistance of ordinary, secular, human knowledge.

The Pendergast novels by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have a similar tone and some similar characters, but they don't get into the techno side of things.

Because there is going to be ""one way to be the best"", that becomes the ""one way to play ____"".  Rotations become a thing that is to be researched, followed blindly, and never questioned.  Gear becomes ""BIS"", and so forth.  It's been my experience that DPS parses, gear, and builds only make those who want to have the best DPS, gear, and builds happy.  It gives them a chance to lord their numbers over others.  There are tons of situations where someone who parses in the middle of the pack can have a larger impact than those around them.  The classic WoW example is the silly hunter that stands in fire whilst topping damage meters and the overextended healing team who keep them alive.   Now, at hardcore levels and events, like those who raid ""Six Days a Week™"", parses and the like probably matter to ween out the weak.

Here is what the CDC says on the page about healthcare workers and the flu vaccine:  &gt;**Flu vaccines CANNOT cause the flu.** The viruses in flu vaccines are either killed (the flu shot) or weakened (the nasal-spray vaccine).  http://www.cdc.gov/flu/healthcareworkers.htm  But on the page about seasonal flu vaccine:  &gt;The viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. (**In clinical studies, transmission of vaccine viruses to close contacts has occurred only rarely.**)  &gt;In children, side effects from LAIV (FluMist®) can include:  &gt;runny nose  &gt;wheezing  &gt;headache  &gt;vomiting  &gt;muscle aches  &gt;fever  &gt;In adults, side effects from LAIV (FluMist®) can include  &gt;runny nose  &gt;headache  &gt;sore throat  &gt;cough  http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm  Do you notice that the list of side-effects is basically identical to the list of Flu symptoms? Did you notice that the clinical trials have demonstrated that it is possible for the Flu vaccine to actually be the cause of Flu in people you come in contact with?  Why is such contradictory information available from one official source?",®
t5_2qlqh,Rimbosity,1371754547,"&gt; His view of language significantly changed the field. You can try to belittle it (ironically as a complete outsider) as much as you like, but note similarly all Einstein did was recognize the universality of Maxwell eq.s.  You realize you just made a big part of my argument for me by bringing up Einstein? :)  Sure, his ideas changed the field of Linguistics. That doesn't make him an expert on politics any more than it would make, say, Dr. Michael DeBakey an expert on politics.   &gt; Again, his politics are widely cited by actual scholars, as opposed to, say, yourself. There's a difference between these two as you already noted.  His politics are also widely *rejected* by actual scholars, as opposed to, say, yourself. There are points of legitimate disagreement in academia. This is good and how it should be.   The same can be said of Ayn Rand, for that matter. And if you'll look carefully, you'll note that the scholars who deride Chomsky are *not*, by and large, embracing Rand.  &gt; What's funny is that conservatism in this country frequently point to the ideological difference between the young and elderly...  I'm not a conservative. Nor am I pointing out a generational distinction.   Young people have been embracing Chomsky for half a century, and Ayn Rand for even longer. The reason their ideas haven't gone off to change the world is because neither's ideas terribly accurately represent reality. Instead, most people hit their 30s, realize the error of their youthful ways, and move on to better-conceived ideologies.  His comments on Glass are likely going to be the wake-up call for the current school year's students, who'll then review other things he's said and realize, ""Hey, he's kind of nutters, isn't he?"" Then another school year will happen, full of another army of doe-eyed folks looking to have their preconceived notions validated by a Smart Guy™.",™

When was ""then""?  * **Isaiah 40:22**  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.)  &gt; It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:  International Standard Version (©2012) &gt;He's the one who sits above the disk of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. He's the one who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in,  Care to provide a literal translation?  I don't know when ""Science back then was"", but  Wikipedia &gt; The concept of a spherical Earth dates back to ancient Greek philosophy from around the 6th century BC,[1] but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century BC when Hellenistic astronomy established the spherical shape of the earth as a physical given.  Also wikipedia &gt;Jewish and Christian tradition held that the entire book is by the 8th century BCE prophet Isaiah, but many scholars have concluded since the late 19th century that it cannot be by a single author.[7]:p.1[8] The observations which have led to this are as follows:[9] Prophecies → Passages of Isaiah 40–66 refer to events that did not occur in Isaiah's own lifetime, such as the rise of Babylon as the world power, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the rise of Cyrus the Great, which is taken as evidence of later composition.[10] R. N. Whybray uses these passages to pinpoint the period of Deutero-Isaiah's activity to 550–539 BCE).[11]  Conclusion: It's not clear whether Isaiah was written before or after the concept of a spherical earth came up. It's not clear from the english translations if it actually refers to a spherical earth.  * **Jeremiah 33:22**  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) &gt;As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.  International Standard Version (©2012) &gt;As the heavenly bodies cannot be counted, and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I'll multiply the descendants of my servant David and the descendants of Levi who serve me.'""  If we ignore for a moment that this is quite of a chliché in poetry anyway, I googled where the ""1100 stars"" figure comes from. The first result is actually another commentary on this exact image:  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Science_Confirms_the_Bible#Incalculable_number_of_stars  &gt; As with most stuff like this, the ""1100 stars"" thing isn't referenced to anything specific so it is difficult to track down. It is probably a reference to Ptolemy, who catalogued just under 1100 stars in The Almagest.[3] These were just the stars that Ptolemy said he was able to see and catalogue properly - that there are more than 1100 stars can be shown by even a casual glance at the sky on a clear night. This is decent enough science, but is quoted very heavily out of context.  Huh, surprise. I have looked at some other results but I have only found other people claiming that ""the ancients"" thought there were only 1100 stars or people doubting that they thought there were only 1100 stars.  Anyway, the number of stars is not literally innumerable. One of the first google results is an estimation from ESA: http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe  &gt;With this simple calculation you get something like 10^22 to 10^24 stars in the Universe. This is only a rough number, as obviously not all galaxies are the same  That's quite a lot but not innumerably many. Just not with the current methods. God could actually have given the exact number in the bible. That would have been impressive.  I also doubt there are as many descendants of David as there are stars in the universe right now. When will it be that there are about 10^22 of them?  Yea, at this point I give up. The rationalwiki has a disturbing lack of sources too, but gives a few pointers that seem ok.

t5_2ri0h,Kichigai,1371776852,"Avid is *very* often described as ""user hostile,"" and it's not entirely inaccurate. However, once you learn it you have a rock solid tool in your belt that may change how you think about video editing entirely. Think of it this way: Avid is like that cranky old mechanic down at the neighborhood garage. He'll yell at you for not doing regular maintenance, but he knows his way around an engine like no one else and has snatched many a vehicle from the jaws of death. He ain't cheap, but that's because he doesn't cut corners under any circumstances.  I think learning Avid without a class will be extremely difficult, but perhaps with a guide or tutorials you can make it happen. It's not an intuitive system in the slightest.  My advice is to forget *everything* you know about editing in FCP or Premiere. Very little of it carries over, and a lot of it will conflict with The Avid Way™ of doing things. And believe me, you **need** to do things The Avid Way™ or else you're in for a world of hurt. But if you sit down, shut up, and do things the way Avid wants, it can dazzle you.  There are a few things you need to know about the Avid way of doing things. **First**: Avid is very old, and, IMHO, is basically build like a tape deck. If you think of Avid as being a massive linear editing system, where each clip is its own tape (or is a segment of tape), you can probably start wrapping your head around things. Don't bother trying to think of it any other way, because that is how Avid treats clips.  **Second**: Sit back and let Avid handle the media. It's considered to have one of the best media management systems around, and I can't say I disagree. You'll just hand it files, and it will bring them into its own private little folder, and unless you are 100% positive you know what you are doing, ***don't mess with it!*** And if Avid doesn't recognize the file as being one of the formats it knows how to handle natively, it *will* transcode it to something it to whatever ""resolution"" you have specified (I'll come back to this). Now, from the standpoint of an FCP/PPro user this might seem like a major waste of time, a major waste of space, terribly inefficient, yadda yadda yadda. From that standpoint, it is. But you have to realize that Avid was developed prior to robust OS-driven media libraries, so everything it handles, it's handling internally, with Avid-developed libraries and data. So if it's not a ""native"" codec, it won't work too well (If you pursue the Avid trial, try AMA Linking files, which is the Avid equivalent to the FCP/PPro way of handling files, and you'll see how poorly Avid can handle some of that stuff). Just kick back and let Avid do its thing.  **Third**: Avid doesn't like mixing frame rates or video resolutions (yes, resolutions as you or I would call them, the frame size of video). When you Import them, Avid will transcode them to match the resolution and frame rate of the project. And the Project's resolution and frame rate will dictate everything that happens to media afterwards. You can get around this using AMA Linking, but AMA Linking has its own issues (it's slow, and it's not always 100% stable).  **Fourth**: Avid has its own vocabulary. What you, or I, might call a combination of video codec and bitrate Avid would call a ""resolution."" The actual resolution (width-by-height of the video) and frame rate are locked into your project. So if your project is a 1080p23.976, every ""resolution"" will make video fit that size and frame rate. For the record, I recommend using DNxHD for everything. It's Avid's own video codec (their equivalent to ProRes), and going with the highest bitrate available (so for 1080p29.97 that would be DNxHD 220, for 23.98 that's DNxHD 175). 10-bit color resolution is indicated with an X (so DNxHD 175 X is DNxHD 175 in 10-bit color space).  **Fifth**: AMA Linking can both be a powerful tool and a great liability. It's the closest thing to how Final Cut or Premiere link to media in Avid. Now, for the most part, it can be slow and unstable. Especially with media like H.264. However, with some media it's not so bad, like ProRes or XDCAM. And when you're bringing in media from things like XDCAM, you actually *want* to AMA Link. You ""mount AMA Volume"" starting at the root of that XDCAM disc/card/etc (copy it to a proper storage system first), and then you can manipulate the media from there. You can use the Consolidate/Transcode tool (select the clips you want, right click, Consolidate/Transcode) to bring everything into the Avid world, and then re-link if things go wrong.  **Sixth**: Exporting from Avid is like nothing you've ever done before. Going to tape is doing a Digital Cut. Exporting a file is a little trickier. First, what you want to do for that is make a Video Mixdown (it makes a single, solid rendered file of the video, then importing it back into the project) and putting that on the top video layer. You can also do Audio Mixdowns, but Avid can kind of do that ""on demand"" when you export.  **Seventh**: The Linux folk have a saying: [RTFM](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/RTFM.html). There's a *wealth* of information in the Avid documentation, and I **seriously** suggest looking at it. It's a huge freaking PDF (and companion PDFs), so I don't really mean sit down and read through it all (seriously, we're talking about hundreds of pages per document). I mean that if there's something you don't know how to do, or you run into a problem, first thing to do is consult the documentation. It's *really* thorough, and it'll get you out of a few tight spots. And if you have a service contract, **use it**. Those folk will help you with everything from random crashes to resolving unique and esoteric problems. There's a reason they call their support ""Avid Customer *Success*.""  Avid is a *whole* different ball of wax than FCP or PPro, so you're really going back to school here, and I seriously suggest coming at this from the standpoint of ""I know nothing."" It's like learning a rotary saw after learning how to use an axe. They'll get the same job done, but you use them in totally different ways. The benefits, though? Avid hasn't really changed its interface or workflows much, so anything you learn from one version of Avid will carry over to previous versions and newer versions. Furthermore, you learn a *highly* marketable skill with a really powerful tool.",™

t5_2qh03,agent00F,1371783140,"&gt; The reason there is currently no way to transition from disk to digital on a console is because nobody has a consumer friendly way to do it yet. Microsoft's solution was openly hostile to consumers, with no clear end of console life strategy and inflexible online requirements. I can go to my parents' house, pull out the Nintendo, plug it into a CRT TV and play some fucking Super Mario Brothers until my thumbs fall off. What happens to the XB1 in 20 years? Nobody fucking knows.   &gt;I want to play Halo 2 on the Xbox online. I can't because Microsoft shut off the XBox Live servers for the original XBox. Tell me why I should trust Microsoft to keep the XBox One servers on indefinitely?  So what other $500 purchases do you plan 20 years into the future for? I hope not your car because in 20 years gas might not even be available. HDDs for example don't even last that long.   &gt; Whether you like used game sales or not, the fact of the matter is that telling someone that they can't sell something they bought (or making them jump through hoops, such as selling only to authorized resellers) is inherently anti-consumer. If you want to take something away from the customer, you have to give them something of similar value in return. What they took away (ease of trading/selling games) was removed and what was returned (vague, conflicting and convoluted messages about authorized resellers and ""family sharing"") was not deemed to be of equal or greater value by a majority of people interested in the next generation of consoles. On top of all that, there was no answer regarding game rentals.   For the **POSSIBLE** **partial** lost convenience of $5 used sale you get play-anywhere w/o disk hunting. Most people have literally lost more $ through just misplaced/mishandled disks than they'll ever get back for a **possible** used game sale. This is so monumentally stupid (and dishonest for anyone who's ever used Steam) that it's not worth ever addressing again, ever.  &gt; You say it's because people don't understand; I say it's because people understand clearly.   No I'm pretty sure the monumental stupidity of the typical gamer has been well established before this conversation even started.    &gt; I didn't understand your point because your fucking point was wrong.   No, you didn't understand the point because your ego depended on failure to understand it. I've added nothing to [transition], yet your most recent reply suggest a perfect fine grasp of the point, however stupid the ever-diminishing excuses that it's not a Real™ transition are.   &gt; Now you've changed tactics from creating straw men to attacking the messenger.   For the sake of your own self-respect I hope these are messages from others you're delivering. I totally admit possible strawmen I've erected to make them sound smarter than do at first glace.  ",™

t5_2qhx4,EagleFalconn,1371787118,"There is so much scientific bullshit on this company's webpage. I'm not qualified to judge their clinical trials. But I am qualified to judge their explanation as to how the thing works.  From [here](http://www.warp-light.com/res_faq.html).  &gt;They have many contraindications (warning). They are extremely expensive averaging $10,000 for even the smallest laser.  Shit, someone better tell Amazon laser pointers are supposed to cost $10K.  &gt;They have little or no contraindications. They are affordable at prices ranging from $80 - $3,000.  This is utter bullshit. If the intensity of light is going to hurt you (which is why you should never stare into a laser pointer, btw) it doesn't matter whether it's in phase or not.  &gt;The FDA indications for use are as follows: The WARP 10® is a high intensity, hand-held, portable, LED (light emitting diode) unit, intended for the treatment of chronic pain by emitting energy in the near-infrared (near-IR) spectrum. This includes: the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis and muscle spasms; and relieving stiffness, promoting relaxation of muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood circulation, where applied.  Just like a hot water bag.  The reason they're using near-IR radiation is because near-IR easily couples to vibrational modes in organic matter and is dissipated as heat. Assuming this thing isn't bullshit.  &gt;We invented the thermal heat sync to pull heat away from the LEDs.  Whoa. I bet they're raking in money for inventing the heat sink used in every piece of electronics since before this company was founded.  &gt;Our unit will penetrate up to 23cm (9 inches) of soft tissue.  Bullshit. 670 nm light (their LED light frequency) will not penetrate 23 cm of soft tissue. If it did, you'd be able to see red light through people when they walked in front of the sun.  &gt;Why does the WARP 10® work? &gt;Light must be absorbed for photochemistry to occur. A simple absorption spectrum (transmission spectrum) of the system under study will immediately tell one if a particular wavelength of light has a chance of producing a photobiological effect (Kendric C. Smith, Ph.D.).  I like how this doesn't answer the question.   &gt;just curious if anyone has used it for fitness... and you haven't so your insight isn't what I'm looking for.

t5_2tex6,djimbob,1371790638,"This mixes up ideas.  Numbers are concrete; e.g., this is twelve hearts ♥♥ ♥♥ ♥♥ ♥♥ ♥♥ ♥♥.  Twelve is our word for the well-defined concept of the number after eleven.  (And you can construct the whole number line from zero with a successor and predecessor).  Similarly this circle ◐ is half filled in; half is the number midway between zero and one.  You write the number as `12` in decimal (b=10), `1100` in binary (b=2), `110` in ternary (b=3), `14` in octal (b=8), `c` in hexadecimal (base=16), `11100` in negabinary (b=-2), `10100` in quarter-imaginary base (b=2i).  (In all bases, the base was written in decimal, and you can calculate the value of a number by summing d(n)*b^n  where d(n) is the value of the n-th digit from the left.)  Now let's say we have ten people and two pies that are split up fairly.  How much does everyone get?  Easy one-fifth each.  Granted in decimal that's easy to represent `0.2`, but in say binary it requires repeating digits (0.001100110011 ...) which will cause rounding errors and be annoying when going back to decimal.  But any base system will have warts, as they'll be some divisors that will be co-prime with the base and result in infinite 'decimal' expansions in that base.  So even if you have programming units (which we sort of do with [binary prefixes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) ), all it does is simplify the task of saying 1 MiB is 1 00000 00000 00000 00000 (binary) bytes, and if you multiply by 1 00000 00000 (binary) (that is 1024 in decimal) it becomes 1 GiB.",♥

t5_2qqdb,porcupinetree3,1371796537,"The whole ""BUT NOT ALL COPS ARE LIKE THAT, SOME ARE GOOD!!11!"" argument isn't valid at all. It is is literally their job to use violence to protect the state. They choose to be cops, they know what the job entails, no one forces them to be cops. Sure every profession has corruption and bad apples, but cops are a special breed in that when they are corrupt they are hardly ever held to the laws that they themselves have sworn to enforce. The damage they inflict on innocents is far beyond your average bad apple at a business. The GoodCops™ are just as responsible as the bad ones if they don't report or use force to stop them, which everyone knows RARELY ever happens. ",™

t5_2qh1i,C0CKTHRUST3R,1371798642," 13 hours ago Longtime CNN Reliable Sources host moves on  Washington (CNN) - Longtime media reporter Howard Kurtz and CNN parted company as Kurtz and CNN confirmed the end of his 15-year run hosting CNN's Reliable Sources program. Kurtz will become a contributor to Fox News.  Kurtz has worked for many years as a media reporter and media critic. He spent 29 years at The Washington Post, the majority of those years working as the Post's media reporter. After leaving the Post in 2010, Kurtz became the Washington Bureau Chief for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, managing the Washington staff and writing on politics and media.  His tenure at the Daily Beast ended earlier this year after Kurtz mistakenly accused Jason Collins, an NBA player who publicly announced he is gay, of failing to disclose that he had once been engaged to a woman. Collins had, in fact, noted his engagement in a story he wrote for Sports Illustrated. Kurtz stated at the time that his departure from the Daily Beast was already in the works.  Kurtz has covered every major American media story over the last 25 years, from the OJ Simpson saga to the Impeachment of President Clinton to the rise of the Internet. His first book, Media Circus: The Trouble with America's Newspapers, foretold the decline of the American newspaper business. His third book, Spin Cycle: Inside the Clinton Propaganda Machine told the tale of how Bill Clinton emerged largely unscathed from the most significant presidential scandal since Watergate.  A CNN spokeswoman said that the Reliable Sources program will continue and a search is underway for a new host.

The guy who criticizes journalism and reporting is going to the network that blatantly lies. Reliable Sources was the dullest Sunday morning show anyway. Thank goodness he's leaving.     June 20, 2013 01:21 pm at 1:21 pm |     Steve, New York City      To me, Howard has always seemed to be a good guy. Maybe he can do something positive for the culture at Fox News.      With few exceptions – (Chris Matthews and Bill O'Reilly – and maybe Morning Joe), I don't watch either Fox News or MSNBC because the majority of what each channel says is editorialized extremist garbage.     June 20, 2013 01:28 pm at 1:28 pm |     Anonymous      One of the only reason I watched CNN was for his Sunday show.     June 20, 2013 01:28 pm at 1:28 pm |     filo bedo      Hypocrisy at it's best.

June 20, 2013 01:31 pm at 1:31 pm |     jk - MN      I've watched Howard's show quite a while and felt that recently, he's been displaying a Fox-like bias in the way he covers media. It's a better fit for him. I personally will not watch his Fox stuff. I can't bring myself to watch anything Fox dishes out. Can't say I'm sorry to see him go.

t5_2sokd,_The_Editor_,1371816459,"After a little googling, it seems a lot of people have had the same experience. so far the following is the best response I've seen:  &gt;You smelled correctly. Nail polish remover is acetone, or ethyl acetate.   &gt;Nearly all fruit aromas are ethyl esters, of which ethyl acetate is one. That same substance -- ethyl acetate -- is one of the definitive aromas of cantaloupe. It's actually IN the cantaloupe.   &gt;What follows is geeky, I admit (I am a food/wine chem geek), but it shows you smelled accurately, Jeda, and the many others above. Here are the aromas in cantaloupe:  &gt;""Ethyl (methylthio) acetate [FIRST ONE RIGHT OFF THE BAT], (Z)-6-nonenyl acetate, (Z, Z)-3,6-nonadienyl acetate, benzyl propionate, benzyl alcohol, a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, cinnamyl acetate and an isomer of 3,4- dimethoxyacetophenone.""  &gt;The smell of acetone or ethyl acetate increases with the cantaloupe's maturity:  &gt;""Analysis of cantaloupe samples at six stages of maturity showed increases in total ethyl and acetate esters, acetaldehyde, *ethyl acetate*, and ethanol with maturation.""  &gt;The ethanol of course, is a sign of fermentation. The ethyl acetate is not.  &gt;Info source:  &gt;Identification of Additional Volatile Compounds from Cantaloupe  &gt; R. J. Horvat, S. D. Senter 1987  &gt;Journal of Food Science Volume 52 Issue 4, Pages 1097 - 1098  &gt;Some cantaloupe varieties have more volatile aromas/esters than others. The varieties meant for a long-shelf life and that are hardier for shipping long distances have fewer aromatic compounds-- they simply don't smell as good. The cantaloupe varieties with a shorter shelf life, like those from good produce stores and farmers markets (I suspect your organic cantaloupe is one of these), have more aromatic esters, which means more flavor, but also a greater possibility of ethyl acetate (acetone):  &gt;""Most of the esters such as ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, and butyl acetate and sulfur compounds such as *ethyl 2-(methylthio)acetate*, 2-methylthioethanol, ethyl 3-(methylthio)propanoate, 3-(methylthio)propyl acetate, and 3-(methylthio)propanol were two- to thirty-fold lower in odor values in long-shelf-life cultivars than in the [cultivars meant for immediate consumption].""  &gt;Info source:  &gt;Investigation of Volatiles in Charentais Cantaloupe Melons. Characterization of Aroma Constituents in Some Cultivars   &gt;Christophe Aubert and Nelly Bourger   &gt;J. Agric. Food Chem., 52 (14), 4522 -4528, 2004. 10.1021/jf049777s S0021-8561(04)09777-8 Copyright © 2004 American Chemical Society   &gt;As far as those instances when the cantaloupe was pureed, or used in a sauce, or refrigerated overnight after cutting, chances are the more volatile esters -- the fruity, pleasant smelling aromas -- simply vanished into the air, leaving the hardier esters -- among them, ethyl acetate -- behind. You'll find the same thing happens in wine that's stored after opening or aged beyond its prime. If the wine has volatile acidity or ethyl acetate to begin with, that is.

t5_2snuc,jez2718,1371823439,"&gt; Yes. On the basis that we have 10 fingers, mostly. Not all civilizations counted in base 10 (which is why minutes have 60 seconds in them), and not all used roman numerals. There's no particular reason why ""5"" has to mean ""five units"", it's just a random squiggle.  &gt; 2+2=5 is only wrong if we agree on the meaning of ""2"", ""+"", ""="" and ""5"", and those rules don't have that result.  What are we discussing here, the sign or the substance? It is trivially subjective and conventional that we attach the squiggle ""true"" to the squiggle ""2 + 2 = 4"", but this is just a statement about the signs used to express it. Is the statement ""electrons repel each other"" subjective because we have to agree on the meanings of the words? Clearly such an attitude is missing the point.  What makes ""electrons repel each other"" objectively true is that the sentence describes a phenomenon that can be objectively determined to exist. In this obvious truth is the crucial aspect that we must look *beyond* the signs used to express a truth and ask what the truth that is being claimed is. Whether you express 2 + 2 = 4 by ""2 + 2 = 4"", ""II + II = IV"" or even by ""∆ $ ∆ £ ©"" doesn't matter, what matters is whether the truth we refer to using the symbols is an objective truth.

t5_2t5sa,AmazingZoltar,1371825397,"For me SRS was at least partially responsible. I used to be your stereotypical Nice Guy™ until the point where I started to think about what I was doing, and decided to start looking up just why it was wrong. I ended up reading some of the stuff on [heartless bitches international](http://www.heartless-bitches.com/) (which I'll be the first to admit is full of internalized misogyny, but hey, it was a first step). This pointed me in the direction of looking more into what I was doing wrong by being a Nice Guy™ namely that I wasn't being assertive enough. I thought about this for a while and thought, that can't be the only reason, everywhere else I'm looking that's teaching me to be more assertive is also trying to push a bunch of skeezy pickup artistry tactics on me (even 15 year old me was staunchly against pickup artistry, even if zie couldn't figure out exactly *why* at the time). I eventually found my way to Man Boobz which at first offended me, because at the time I was still an MRA, but I started reading more feminist slanted blogs, like pervocracy and captain awkward. I believe it was through captain awkward that I discovered John Scalzi's blog post on ""how not to be a creep"" Scalzi managed to put it in simple, not too offending, but not so coddling that it wasn't kicking 15 year old me in the ass that something actually clicked. I realized ""holy shit, that's what I've been doing wrong this whole time"" and I promptly realized that the best thing for me and others around me was to stop being a creeper. Up until then, I had been a normal redditor, despising SRS because I couldn't understand it. I tried reading SRS again after some time spent as part of the Manboobz commentariat, and it was completely different, everything here just kind of made sense to me. And that was me in my last year of high school, in the months after I'd been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Nowadays I'm a bit less active in the fempire than I was on my last account, but SRS did help me with a lot of things in my life, like discovering that agendered is actually a valid identity, considering I've never really felt like a man or a woman, even though I identified as male back at 15 years.   **Tl;dr Manboobz, John Scalzi, and SRS turned me from a Nice Guy™ MRA into a genderqueer feminist**",™

t5_2s599,Zankman,1371828510,"Ah, I see - the memories make you you, and with so many different memories, you eventually lose yourself.   Well, a couple of ""in-universe"" things to consider:  1. My OC has no soul; Rather, he didn't have it long before he started taking other people's souls.  2. His revival came 1000+ years after his death. The way his revival (via a combination of technology and necromancy) works, he basically had those 1000+ years worth of time to use for *thinking* - but since he wasn't aware during his death, it all came to him after he was revived. Subsequently, he spent a few years in solitude *thinking* about, and condensing those 1000+ into thoughts.   3. He himself was quite intelligent during his life.  4. He was left with incredible necromantic power which he then developed and strengthened further.   5. He quickly got *a lot* of pure knowledge and intelligence via some powerful souls, and rather quickly he also got some ""magic"" (just in general, like arcane stuff).   All of this could explain, especially by a conscious effort by him, his ability to limit and even completely control and prohibit the effects of the memories that he inadvertently gained.   Then again, Number 1 plays into the whole thing weirdly. He has no Soul - it was literately striped away from him and given to NO SPOILERS :D.  Yet, he still has the memories, and subsequently, the knowledge, powers, abilities and personality - as a base, that is.   So, how does he (un)live as an actual cognitive being, if he has no Soul? Shouldn't he be just a mindless undead monstrosity?   I really should work these things out, maybe even use some Plot Convenience™, but he basically *has no Soul*, but *has everything as if he still had it*, and he *takes the Souls of others and uses them*, but *doesn't lose himself to become a weird amalgamation of different memories*.

t5_2tbbg,niccig,1371830076,"I did a quick search and found this from the Mayo Clinic blog:  &gt; When you're choosing sunglasses, look for UV-protection details on product labels. Choose sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays. Skip sunglasses that neglect to offer details about their UV protection. Keep in mind that the color and degree of darkness sunglasses provide have nothing to do with the sunglasses' ability to block UV rays. Also, opt for wraparound sunglasses or close-fitting sunglasses with wide lenses that protect your eyes from every angle.   Oakley for one does specify UV info on their lenses:  &gt; UV protection of PLUTONITE® lens that filters out 100% of UVA/UVB/UVC &amp; harmful blue light up to 400nm  You have to search around for it, but the Ray-Ban site also says that all their lenses block 100% UVA/UVB/harmful blue light (up to 400nm).   I personally like Oakley glasses. I have two pairs in the same style (different colors, one prescription, one not) and both have held up really well over the 5-ish years I've had them. They haven't bent, scratched or had unreasonably loose screws, which are the problems I usually have with glasses, and once I got them fitted the first time, I haven't had to do it again. And they don't bounce around while I run :-) I had a pair of Oakley frames for my regular vision-correcting glasses too, and they were my favorite in my entire 17-year-history of glasses-wearing, until my dog chewed them up :-P  Some folks say that paying more for them is a waste of money since they're owned by Luxottica (which owns a bazillion other eyewear brands, expensive and cheap) but I think they're like any other conglomerate/OEM manufacturer - there are pretty big differences in the quality of their brands. I have a couple of sunglasses/regular eyeglasses from other Luxottica-owned names, and haven't been impressed by them. On one pair, I *can not* keep the temple screws from falling out, and on my regular daily glasses, the metal arms are painted and the paint scratches really easily.   ",®

t5_2rn3p,TychoCelchuuu,1371831849,"Taking an MG from the front is much *easier* in CoH 2. Between smoke grenades, Oorah, increased grenade lethality, Hit the Dirt's anti-suppression power, and TrueSight™ to get in close before your opponent knows you're coming, I've seen lots of instances in replays where players have basically just run up to MGs, throw a molotov or Shock Troop grenade or even a Satchel Charge, or just Hit the Dirt before they get suppressed, and win. That stuff rarely happened in CoH and if it did, it was from Rangers, a later game call-in, not Conscripts, which start the game with Oorah.  Listen, I know how LOS works in RTS games. One of my favorite RTS games is Men of War, which does the TrueSight™ thing except even more detailed and without all the funky glitches. So I don't have a problem with flanking 'the real way.' But in Company of Heroes 2, the maps are small, the game is fast, the squads are little blobs of units that you can't direct with pinpoint accuracy, the TrueSight™ is inconsistent, the weapon crews are hard to reposition, and the suppression mechanic is the linchpin of infantry tactics. Given all of that, TrueSight™ fucks up the brilliant flanking mechanic they had in vCoH and makes it so that a single squad of Conscripts can do whatever you want.",™

Microsoft betrayed their customers by cooperating with the NSA. the fact that they were legally required and were just following order is an excuse but not a reason to expect that they won't do it again.

t5_2qh03,shadowthunder,1371840324,"I absolutely agree that the **policies needed to change** - neither Microsoft's original plan nor what they ended up changing it to was great.  They could have done any number of things to address the internet's concerns, but the ultimate result is really just the equivalent of a pouting child giving up.  With Steam's model, you activate the game initially, then play without the disk indefinitely (maybe?  I recall it asking me to sign in before I could play a game once or twice before, but I don't know whether there was anything else at play in that situation).  Alternatively, if you didn't have internet, you could install and play directly from the disk.    Microsoft needed to emulate that.  Yes, there's the possibility that I install a game, check it in, take my Xbox offline, then let my friend do the same, allowing us to play locally simultaneously with a single copy.  They could've made the check-in period every other day or even once per week, but that doesn't matter - if I own a game, I should be able to play it whenever I want with no check-ins required.  If I want to play the game currently in the console, no check-ins ever necessary.  There was **no reason Microsoft couldn't've done a ""best of both worlds"" situation**, and that they didn't really bothers me.  Hell, they could've even had an even more-hybridized scenario, where you can play diskless for 24 hours past the last check-in, after which you either connect or put the disk in.  Want to share a game?  Handing the disk to someone else would literally be all that's necessary, same as now.  Or, if you have an internet connection, there are more possibilities.  My point is that they could've easily had to the console ""revert"" into an offline mode (that functions identically to the 360 or PS4 without a connection) after 24 hours.  **If you have a steady/stable/reliable connection once/day, additional scenarios are open for you.  If not, there's zero punishment.**  Another place Microsoft misstepped was in the pricing.  If they want to continue to launch games at the standard $60 price-point, go for it.  Steam games often still launch at $50, standard for PC games.  However, Microsoft also needed to emulate Steam's constant **massive sales on games and bundles**.  Money goes to the makers of the game (their goal), I don't have to go around to different GameStops trying to find a used copy, and I still can play that older game without paying the full amount.  I've never once heard anyone complain about how Steam doesn't allow you to sell your digital copies.  Even still, I'm sure there's a way to do it.  What about this:  **You should get three options when selling a game as used:**  1. Because there's no deterioration in the value of a digital copy, you can ""deactivate"" your copy for N% (10%?  20%?  I don't know what's fair) of the current Xbox Marketplace price.  Money you receive comes from Microsoft, but stays in such a form where it can only be used to buy Microsoft software/services.  It goes into your Microsoft Wallet, where you can use it to purchase music, movies, and games from the Xbox store, Skype credit, Xbox Live scrip, apps for Windows/Windows Phone, or Microsoft software for your computer.  If they gave you cash/a credit card refund, Microsoft would have to keep an insane amount of highly volatile money on hand - a decent fraction of the total sales of any XB1 game ever; because of this, I think it's fair to only be able to spend it on non-hardware stuff from Microsoft, because there's no materials/manufacturing/shipping cost.  2. If you have a physical copy, you can do whatever you want with it - sell it, give it away, rent it out.  It's a physical copy, so why should a publisher or Microsoft have any say in it?  3. Direct transfer of digital copy between XBL friends.  Payment can either be hashed out in-person (no fee), or there's an option for Microsoft to facilitate a transaction at whatever price the users agree.  Payments can be MS Wallet -&gt; MS Wallet (no cut), RealMoney™ -&gt; real money (Microsoft takes a 5% cut, to cover transaction fees and make some money; I think that's fair for facilitating this scenario), or real money -&gt; MS Wallet (no cut because MS Wallet money can only be spent on software, where Microsoft's already making a big per-unit profit).  Transactions cannot go from MS Wallet to real money, because that'd expose the hole discussed in option 1.   I'm sure there are flaws in this, but nothing that can't be worked out (as Microsoft ought to have done before implementing this).  In typing these up, I realize now why Microsoft had the ""friends for 30 days"" rule in place - otherwise, a third-party market for digital sales could pop up and undercut the current price of digital downloads.  Yes, that's a legal move and all, but it's also a dick move.  30 days might be a little excessive, but I can see a week.  I feel as though this is one bone it makes sense to throw to the game producers.  I'm not sure what exactly was going on with the ""**family sharing**"" mode.  Yes, I've read the [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/TE1MWES2) about how it's a ""demo mode"".  My guess is as good as yours on the details, but it sounds more **similar to Nintendo's ""Download Play""**, which let friends without Mario Kart DS borrow the necessary bits from my game card, so we could play together - multiple handhelds (consoles, for the XB1), one game copy.  It's 95% of the experience of local multiplayer (one primary account, everyone else can play along with them), just minus the potential hassle of driving over to your friend's place to physically be in the same location as the disk.  I thought that sounded pretty sweet.  Yes, it's an timed experience of the game, but it's also free (because your friend was the one who bought/possesses the game).  I think people were focused too much on the word ""demo"", which implies an incomplete experience (e.g. one map/stage/level, standard weapons/equipment only), rather than the fact that it was enabling the ability to have **multiple consoles play together using a single copy of the game**.  That's cool.  Perhaps not ""innovative"" in the sense that Nintendo did something similar years ago with the DS (and I'm sure some PC games operated the same way before that), but certainly when it came to consoles (Sony's equivalent feels poorly implemented).  It's still important to note that the ""family sharing"" mode would get the full experience - saving progress and everything - just with a time-limit.  Personally, I'm surprised that the outrage was about the 24-hour check-in and not the **Kinect mandate**, especially with the recent NSA stuff.  The notion that anyone's listening in on our daily lives is silly (I hope.  I really, _really_ hope that's silly.).  If you don't know, here **how audio recognition works in a nutshell**: ""features"" are picked out from the input (in this case, an audio wave; a feature might be the timing between two peaks of a specific height) to provide a set of values and these values are run through a network of weights that eventually arrive at a result.  With a massive network, these results could be a complete dictionary of words, but the ""passive listening"" happens even when the XB1 is in a hibernating state, so I'd expect it to be a simple determination of ""did I hear 'xbox, on'?"" - if the answer's ""no"", then the audio is tossed.  It's not actually sending audio back to Microsoft for the NSA to intercept or surreptitiously request.  It has no idea what you said unless it was ""xbox, on""; everything else is junk data.  However, **the console should _still_ have been able to function if it's not plugged in**.  If I'm packing up for a LAN party, the fewer things I have to unplug and rewire later, the better.  Just like the internet connection, it should serve to enable additional scenarios, not to restrict the console when it's without.  You have to admit, though - being able to pick up _any_ controller and have it know whose profile to load for that controller is really cool.  I really think **both parties are to blame**.  Microsoft's vision didn't properly account for some really important edge-cases, the internet blew it completely out of proportion, Microsoft's PR (both through Twitter support and straight out of the execs' mouths) was significantly worse than it's typical poor marketing (""just buy a 360"" was an unforgivably asinine thing to say; telling people to maintain parallel consoles, game libraries, and accessories because they don't have steady internet access...), and when Microsoft finally changed their stance, they just threw their hands up, rather than trying to work _with_ the most important people in the picture - the customers.  As I always have internet where I have my console and I tend not to buy games that I don't think have massive replay value (i.e. I don't sell my games as used), I was super-excited about the new features, as the restrictions enabling them would've have affected me.  **I _was_ going to get an Xbox One**, but with the removal of those features, I may just stick with my Wii U and gaming PC.  If Microsoft does what it should, and implements a compromise solution (hopefully using some of the ideas here) where, I'll go back to being excited for it as more than just a console with better graphics.  I think one of **Microsoft's largest faults** is that their money comes ""partners"" - other corporations with whom they make contracts - rather than us individuals.  The result is that we've gone from customers (whom they try to please) to consumers (who are statistics).  The result are these business-people at the top of the org structures making big calls that impact the experience of using an entertainment device.",™

t5_2uhpg,Rotanikleb,1371843112,"I want to like the game. I'm trying my hardest. I've put in a lot of time so far and have Captain America (whom I purchased for 12 dollars) at level 43 and Hawkeye at level 47. With the nerf of limbo XP, it just feels pointless to go past 30. I'm grinding Captain and Hawkeye for what? Better gear? Okay I get better gear, now what do I use it for? Nothing. No trading, no amassing riches, no e-pen measurement. Usually, the drive to level 60 alone will fuel people into playing, but Gaz's aversion to this practice is off putting. The only fun part would be playing through the story on a new character, except the ones I have left to play through are Storm, Daredevil, and Scarlet Witch, none of which I have a desire to play. If I wanted to keep having fun, I'd have to shell out real life money for Ironman, Spiderman, or Cyclops. There is practically no chance I get them through endgame farming as the Hero Token drop system first favors the character you play, then the starter heroes.   I'll admit, the game has a future, even if it comes after a plummet to the bottom. They need trading and better in-game communication. Those two things alone may turn the game around. Right now, there is just no point to doing endgame. As I said, getting items for the sake of getting items isn't something sustainable. Even if trading is superficial and doesn't address the issue that items are essentially meaningless, people *love* playing Economy: The Game™.

I don't care he wants Larry dead.  **Larry:** WHAT?!  **Chris Steel:** I said **SHUT UP!** *ahem* For all I care you bring the entire glorious Nation of Hurtsville. At Battleground, I'll prove to you I deserve this championship, no matter at what cost. Oh, and don't worry, I won't cheat. The only way I'll possibly be disqualified is by beating you too viciously.   *Chris lifts his feet from Larry's back. Larry barely notices and continues reading his book.*  **Chris Steel:** Oh, and I spent some of my free time learning special effects. Look at this gem I made!   *The screen fades to purple and the HvX logo pops up on the screen for about 2 seconds before it gets shattered to pieces by a golden 'CS'. The screen then slowly fades to black.*  ---  OOC: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3635/3518439603_af1651b64b.jpg",™

t5_2swc7,boran_blok,1371846070,"A bit of a calm week this week since I'm busy writing a DeFLACer tool/script (DAE hate FLAC ?)  &amp;nbsp;  Finished [**Kimi ga Nozomu Eien**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=147) on Sunday  The way this show utilizes flashbacks makes it quite confusing at times to know where in the timeline you are. At certain points I was really confused until a certain event pinpoints where we are and then I have to rethink the whole scene.  This show is very painful to watch, for me at least. Not because it is bad or anything, it's just so realistic.  I cant blame anyone on the situation, and there is no good way out without hurting anyone.  [Well, if I would blame anyone ](/s ""it would be the doctors, and her parents. Seriously, who thinks that keeping a three year coma secret from the, now awake, coma patient is a good idea?"") [ThereAreNoTherapists](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists)  Now, this might be blasphemy to some, but the feeling I got when watching this was quite similar to School Days. There was not really a lot of physical cheating going on, but mental there was a lot of it.   It is a drama that goes very deep into the psychology of the characters, and what their doubts and fears lead to.  The ending was very, very good. And very very sad. There's no magic here, someone had to get hurt very much, and that is exactly what happened.  &amp;nbsp;  Finished [**Joshiraku**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=12679) on Saturday  Well, I just finished this to get it marked completed. Not to say this is a bad show, not at all. But I have to say a lot of the later eps had humor that went way over my head, so only the slapstick remained.  I could not give a rating to it on MAL, because it would be meaningless.  &amp;nbsp;  Started watching [**Ergo Proxy \(8/23\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=790)  * Post apocalyptic world: ✔ * Dystopia: ✔ * Robots: ✔ * Strong female lead: ✔  This show has a LOT of things I really like. Its drawing style is also very nice, and creepy at the same time, it's like they are at some points very close to the uncanny valley. The robots are also drawn very creepy. It reminds me quite a bit of a film noir due to its color palette.  This shows pacing is excellent, it really gives me the experience of a good book so far. Not too fast, but every episode at least one or two very significant things happen that keep you on your feet.  I also decided to pace this show a bit slower to let it soak in.  &amp;nbsp;  Because of that I started watching something completely different as well: [**IS: Infinite Stratos \(4/12\)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=9041)  This series is trying to check off all clichés of a harem anime off its checklist. But it is a nice change of pace and a bit of brainless fun.  This is the first show where I actually got annoyed by the plot holes. Probably due to their massive size.  I'll finish it, but I know already I am not going to give it a good rating.",✔

t5_2qhv7,tumba_burros,1371852345,"**a)** Cuando se trata de unir dos gentilicios, pueden separarse con guion o escribirse unidos sin guion. Si en el sustantivo al que se aplica el gentilicio compuesto se fusionan los caracteres propios de cada uno de los elementos que lo forman, no se escribe guion entre ellos: [ciudad] *hispanorromana*, [ciudadano] *francocanadiense*, [dialecto] *navarroaragonés*. En estos casos, el primer elemento del compuesto pierde el acento gráfico, si le correspondía llevarlo como palabra independiente: [escritor] *italofrancés*. Si lo que se desea es poner en relación dos adjetivos gentilicios que conservan su referencia independiente, se escribe guion entre ambos: [relaciones] *germano-soviéticas*, [frontera] *chileno-argentina*, [cumbre] *luso-española*. Aquí el guion funciona nuevamente con valor de enlace similar al de una preposición o una conjunción, y, como se ve en los ejemplos, el primer elemento permanece invariable, mientras que el segundo concuerda en género y número con el sustantivo; además, cada elemento conserva la acentuación gráfica que le corresponde como palabra independiente: [película] *ítalo-francesa*. En cualquiera de las dos situaciones, el primer gentilicio tiende a adoptar, si la tiene, la variante en *-o*, basada en muchos casos en la forma clásica (griega o latina) del gentilicio: *hispano-* (‘español’), *luso-* (‘portugués’), *anglo-* (‘inglés’), *fino-* (‘finés o finlandés’), *austro-* (‘austríaco’), etc.  *Diccionario panhispánico de dudas ©2005* *Real Academia Española © Todos los derechos reservados*",©

Don't fixate on synonyms, and think about it in a more general sense.  If you can't, here's a synonym-related example: in simple math no one will complain if you use ""y"" instead of ""x"" in an equation - that would be a synonym.

This enables PlayStation®4 Eye to cut out the image of player from background, or to grasp players’ position in front and behind, further broadening the ways to enjoy games. Incorporated four microphones are also capable of accurate sound detection and source origination. In addition, users will be able to login to their PS4 with face recognition and are capable of using their own body movements or voices to enjoy games more intuitively. Furthermore, PlayStation®4 Eye senses the color of DUALSHOCK®4’s light bar to judge the positions of multiple players, and set characters in the same positions or let a character talk to a particular player, enabling players to enjoy games in new way. PlayStation®4 Eye also supports PlayStation®Move motion controller. It detects the motion of PS Move more precisely, and reflects players’ in-game motion more accurately than ever.  We've only seen one use for it so far - Media Molecule's clay sculpting tech demo, but the above section has some neat ideas on how it could work on a non-gaming level. ",®

t5_2qh03,2dollarb,1371867321,"Actual text of the article:   The FBI is unhappy that there are communications technologies that it cannot intercept and wants to require that software makers and communications companies create a back door so they can listen in when they desire.  But a team of technology experts warns the move would hand over to the nation’s enemies abilities they are not capable of developing for themselves.  The Washington Post reported the issue is being raised by the FBI because “there is currently no way to wiretap some of these communications methods easily, and companies effectively.”  The solution, according to the FBI, is to fine companies when they fail to comply with wiretap orders, essentially requiring all companies to build a back door for wiretap capabilities into all their communications links.  “The importance to us is pretty clear,” FBI general counsel Andrew Weissman said in the report. “We don’t have the ability to go to court and say, ‘We need a court order to effectuate the intercept.’”  But a report by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology warns of unintended consequences.  “Wiretap functionality allows covert access to communications that can be exploited not only by law enforcement, but by criminals, terrorists, and foreign military and intelligence agencies,” the report said. “Wiretap endpoints will be vulnerable to exploitation and difficult to secure.”  It cited a report called “CALEA II: Risks of Wiretap Modifications to Endpoints.”  The report came just as the U.S. government was caught accessing telephone records for the Associated Press and describing a prominent Fox News journalist as a potential criminal.  It was compiled by high-profile leaders in the field such as Matt Blaze from the University of Pennsylvania, Edward Felten of Princeton, Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins and J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan.  The report said there are some drawbacks to expanding wiretap design laws to Internet services.  “Mandating wiretap capabilities in endpoints poses serious security risks,” the report said. “Requiring software vendors to build intercept functionality into their products is unwise and will be ineffective, with the result being serious consequences for the economic well-being and national security of the United States.”  Just what kind of “serious consequences”?  “The FBI’s desire to expand CALEA mandates amounts to developing for our adversaries capabilities that they may not have the competence, access, or resources to develop on their own,” the report said.  CALEA is the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which already requires some electronic surveillance possibilities. It’s the plan the FBI wants to expand to all digital forms of communication, including Skype and VoIP services.  The London Daily Mail recently reported that those technologies are hard to track because they convert analogue audio signals into digital data packets, which would have to be retrieved and reassembled.  The team of experts said that besides allowing criminals and terrorists into the networks, the strategy would require software companies to have employees do the wiretapping or give away their company secrets to law enforcement agencies.  “Finally, the wiretap capability that the FBI seeks will be ineffective because it is easily disabled and because knock-off products that lack the wiretap functionality can be readily downloaded from websites abroad. Because many of the tools that people use to communicate are built on open standards and open source software, it will be trivial to remove or disable wiretap functionality,” the report said.  According to the Post report, the draft proposal would let a court levy escalating fines against a company – fines that could double daily.  “This proposal is a non-starter that would drive innovators overseas and cost American jobs,” Greg Nojeim, a senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the Post.  “They might as well call it the Cyber Insecurity and Anti-Employment Act.”     © Copyright 1997-2013.

I used to be your stereotypical Nice Guy™ until the point where I started to think about what I was doing, and decided to start looking up just why it was wrong. I ended up reading some of the stuff on [heartless bitches international](http://www.heartless-bitches.com/) (which I'll be the first to admit is full of internalized misogyny, but hey, it was a first step). This pointed me in the direction of looking more into what I was doing wrong by being a Nice Guy™ namely that I wasn't being assertive enough. I thought about this for a while and thought, that can't be the only reason, everywhere else I'm looking that's teaching me to be more assertive is also trying to push a bunch of skeezy pickup artistry tactics on me (even 15 year old me was staunchly against pickup artistry, even if zie couldn't figure out exactly why at the time). I eventually found my way to Man Boobz which at first offended me, because at the time I was still an MRA, but I started reading more feminist slanted blogs, like pervocracy and captain awkward. I believe it was through captain awkward that I discovered John Scalzi's blog post on ""how not to be a creep"" Scalzi managed to put it in simple, not too offending, but not so coddling that it wasn't kicking 15 year old me in the ass that something actually clicked. I realized ""holy shit, that's what I've been doing wrong this whole time"" and I promptly realized that the best thing for me and others around me was to stop being a creeper. Up until then, I had been a normal redditor, despising SRS because I couldn't understand it. I tried reading SRS again after some time spent as part of the Manboobz commentariat, and it was completely different, everything here just kind of made sense to me. And that was me in my last year of high school, in the months after I'd been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Nowadays I'm a bit less active in the fempire than I was on my last account, but SRS did help me with a lot of things in my life, like discovering that agendered is actually a valid identity, considering I've never really felt like a man or a woman, even though I identified as male back at 15 years.   Tl;dr Manboobz, John Scalzi, and SRS turned me from a Nice Guy™ MRA into a genderqueer feminist  ",™

In the evening on June 10th, 2013, the angel of the Lord brought on this message of God to Benjamin Cousijnsen.    Shalom! I greet you in the wonderful name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Rafaël and I am the messenger angel of God.  Verily, hear attentively,  Read aloud: Wisdom 1, verse 7 to 10, and verse 12 to 16, and Wisdom 2, verse 1 to 24  I’ll start with Wisdom 1, verse 7 to 10  Here it is written:  Since the Lord's spirit fills the entire world, and holds everything in it together, she knows every word that people say. No one who speaks wickedly will escape notice; sooner or later he will receive just punishment. The intentions of ungodly people will be closely examined; their words will be reported to the Lord, and then they will get the punishment that their wickedness deserves. God will tolerate no challenge, and since he hears everything, you cannot hide your complaining from him.  And verse 12 to 16  Do not bring on your own death by sinful actions. Do not attract the destruction by what you do. God did not invent death, and when living creatures die, it gives him no pleasure. He created everything so that it might continue to exist, and everything he created is wholesome and good. There is no deadly poison in them. No, death does not rule this world, for God's justice does not die. Ungodly people have brought death on themselves by the things they have said and done. They yearn for death as if it were a lover. They have gone into partnership with death, and it is just what they deserve.  Wisdom 2, verse 1 to 24  Here it is written: Wicked people are wrong when they say to themselves, “Our life is short and full of sorrow, and when its end comes, there is no escape. No one has ever been known to come back from the world of the dead. We were born by chance, and after life is over, we will be as if we had never been born at all. Our breath is no more than a puff of smoke; our mind is nothing more than a spark thrown off by the beating of our heart. When that spark dies, our body will crumble into ashes, and our breath will become part of the empty air. In time, no one will remember anything we ever did, and even our names will be forgotten. Our lives will pass away like the traces of clouds and vanish like fog in the heat of the sun. Our time on earth is like a passing shadow. There is no escape from the day of our death; it is fixed, and no one can postpone it.” The wicked say, “Come on, then, let's enjoy the good things of life, and live in this world the way we did when we were young and free of care! Let's drink the most expensive wines and use the finest perfumes. Let's not miss a single flower in the springtime! Before the roses wither, let's pick them and wear them in our hair! Let's all join in and leave signs everywhere of our carefree revelry! Life owes us that much! “We'll oppress the poor, even if they are righteous. We'll show no respect for widows or old people. We'll call ourselves right if we are strong enough to get what we want. No one ever got anywhere by being weak! Righteous people are nothing but a nuisance, so let's look for chances to get rid of them. They are against what we do; they accuse us of breaking the Law of Moses and violating the traditions of our ancestors. They claim to know God, and they call themselves the Lord's children. We can't stand the sight of people like that; what they are contradicts our whole way of thinking. They are not like other people; they have strange ways. They think that our moral standards are so corrupt that everything we do should be avoided. They boast of having God for their Father, and believe that when all is said and done, only the righteous will be happy. But we'll see if that's true! Let's see what will happen when it's time for them to die! If the righteous really are God's children, God will save them from their enemies. So let's put them to the test. We'll be cruel to them, and torment them; then we'll find out how calm and reasonable they are! We'll find out just how much they can stand! We'll condemn them to a shameful death. After all, they say that God will protect them.” That is how evil people think, but they are wrong. They are blinded by their own wickedness. They have never known God's secrets, never hoped for the rewards of a holy and blameless life. When God created us, he did not intend for us to die; he made us like himself. It was the devil's jealousy that brought death into the world, and those who belong to the devil are the ones who will die. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily,   John 3, verse 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.     James 2, verse 26  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.  Read aloud: Hebrews 9, verse 14 to 15, and verse 27 to 28, and Deuteronomy 30, verse 19, and John 5, verse 21 to 29  I’ll start with Hebrews 9, verse 14 to 15  Here it is written: How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. And verse 27 to 28  Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment, so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation. Deuteronomy 30, verse 19  Here it is written: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed.   John 5, verse 21 to 29  Here it is written: For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires. For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him. “Most assuredly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. Most assuredly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.” The messenger angel of God spoke further,   I'm going now; think about this message. Where your soul is full of, there you shall be: heaven or hell! Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.  SHALOM!

t5_2qlqh,aardvark2zz,1371881888,"Same here. It seems to add a backspace when entering new words. It converts ""hello world how are you"" to ""hell worl ho ar you"". The backspace and space is immediately done when entering the 1st letter of the next word; for both swyping a word and individual letter method.  But when using Swype and using its suggested ""random"" words it works fine e.g. ""tippy for your phone is"" after touching the words individually.  Also, the comma and numbers 0-9 don't work. I get ""♦"" instead of the comma and nothing for the numbers. All of the shift-numbers (seen on laptop keyboard such as ~!@#$%\^&amp;*() and `~-_=+   ) work, but FYI, the more unusual characters like euro, yen, etc... don't work.

Or at least was, I was finally able to get into therapy and its slowly but surely making things better with myself and my parents. If need be, just write them a letter on how you feel. How its unfair they are having you take this much work and responsibility, how you're only a teenager once and you want to enjoy it as much as possible. If that means ""helping"" them out 60% of the time &amp; just having fun with friends 40%, (or whatever split you think may work best) so be it. Let them know its crushing you and while you love your family, sometimes you just need out, need time with people your own age. Write it in a letter. And try to get a therapist, it may not seem too enticing, but that's what I did, 2 months into therapy, I can say things are better. Not quite where they should be, but the progress is making me optimistic. Things don't have to suck. I know we're only 16, but we can still have some degree of control over our lives. Good luck❤",❤

When I started several weeks ago, it was my official first time to play it (my unofficial first time was a catastrophe, and I'm glad that I started a new game).  Now I can understand, why it is loved by so many gamers.  I am really impressed by the whole postapocalyptic, dystopian scenario (I'm generally a great fan of sci-fi and dystopia). For me, the whole RPG-thing was a bit bumpy at the beginning, because I've never been into such gameplay.  But right from my first steps into the wasteland, I wanted to achieve success.  All these creative and tenderly created details and facets are so stunning.  It's pure fun to walk around, explore, get and solve quests. And! I personally appreciate the various enemy and creature designs - people, animals, mutants, ghouls... they are so well thought and creative. From the small mole rats, to yao-guais and even up to the super mutants behemoth.  i love it. ♥  **EDIT**: Awww man, I TOTALLY forgot about the **awesome** random encounters and surprises one can witness in the wasteland - these are a great idea and refresh the whole gaming experience.",♥

Exodus 12:12 ""On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.  Women's rights: Genesis 3:16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   Isaiah 3:12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.   1 Corinthians 11:3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.   1 Corinthians 14:34-36  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.   Ephesians 5:22-24  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   1 Timothy 2:11-15  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing.   Titus 2:4-5  Teach the young women to be ... obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.   1 Peter 3:1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.

Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (King James Version)  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;   29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.  Leviticus 25:44 English Standard Version (©2001) As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.

""But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27. In a parable, but spoken of favorably.)  John 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  Jesus encouraged the beating of slaves: ""And that servant [slave], which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."" (Luke 12:47)  Matthew 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

(Matthew 13:41-42)  Exodus 34 4 So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the Lord had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. 5 Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the Lord. 6 And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”   Luke 14:26 If anyone comes to me and does not HATE his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters,......1 John 3:15 Anyone who HATES his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him   Jesus looked at his critics ""with anger"" (Mark 3:5), and attacked merchants with a whip (John 2:15). He showed his respect for life by drowning innocent animals (Matthew 8:32). He refused to heal a sick child until he was pressured by the mother and after he called her a dog(Matthew 15:22-28)  Mark 14:3-7 3 While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. 4 Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume? 5 It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages[a] and the money given to the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly. 6 “Leave her alone,” said Jesus. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 7 The poor you will always have with you,[b] and you can help them any time you want.

New International Version (©1984) The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 English Standard Version (ESV) 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous[a] will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:  neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,[b] 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  Kings 2 2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

You act as though ""gaining converts"" is everyone's goal, and the mission statement of the sub in general. It's not. Or at least, it *wasn't,* until the ToR marketing geniuses decided to renovate the circus into a kinder, gentler reception lobby for atheism. If you're not a clone of the Friendly Atheist, *just go away, you! And you kids, out of the pool! We don't want your kind here!* Yeah, because we won't be needing any atheists from the younger generations, we've filled the quota from the twentysomethings, we're good to go. Be careful what you wish for, newly minted mature adults, these kids coming up will be changing your diapers when you're in nursing homes. Good thing I'll be long dead by then. :D  Just because someone participated in the old sub doesn't mean they were trying to convert *anyone*, and to say that's the only valid reason for *any* participation is singularly myopic. There are lots of ways to arrive at the conclusion that atheism is the only stance on religion that makes sense, if that's your goal. A steady diet of Patheos blogs and Matt Dillahunty videos is just one. Sometimes a simpler message is what a person needs to see an obvious truth, sometimes it's an in-depth analysis. Neither approach is more ""valid"" than the other, and I would have thought that so-called skeptics would recognize that. And I would have thought a skeptic would have embraced a democratic, user-led community, rather than a top-down approach, but clearly I am 0 for 2 here.  My own road to atheism was no-muss, no-fuss. I just read the Bible when I was a little girl, and quickly realized that it sounded just like the Greek mythology I was also reading, whose gods were dismissed as myth. It was easy to dismiss the Bible as myth too, since the deities were vengeful, stupid and overtly evil in both narratives. Besides, Barbies were more fun.   And let the record show that I'm not twelve years old, nor have a been for many decades, so you'll have to trot out some other convenient dismissive disparagement for me. What does the wizened old crone know, anyway?  ETA: Don't have a legit argument? Just laugh and point! People will assume you have a legit argument. What do they call that? The ridicule fallacy?   Also, if you guys wouldn't downvote me to hell because I'm not part of your circlejerk, I'd be able to respond to all your comments in a more timely manner. Or, you could just not respond.

I love players that I know have worked really hard to make their teams work against the odds, like LLND, Royal Flush, but especially Abegen. I feel he is a kindred soul of sorts to me. I almost cried when I took him out at FR, real talk. I love dominant overall players like Justin Wong, Chris G, FChamp and Tokido, because they're what I strive to become. I love hard workers, people that have a burning desire of improving, at any cost. Gllty is a player I've met in my travels that falls easily in this group. I love OGs, like Watts and Valle, they have a wisdom that you can't find anywhere else that I always take time to learn from, I love the stories from the old days. I love the players that always have the time to go out of their way to say hi to me just because they're nice like that even though they don't need to. Overall, I have too many favorite players.  Thoughts on Zero? He is easily the best point character, by strength alone. But as I said, this game is about teams, not single entities. He is one of the characters that exploits one of the things I hate from the game. I guess I can discuss more about that later?  Favorite japanese car? I used to like the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo a lot, but now I'm all about the Subaru Impreza Rally Ed., the blue/yellow motif just calls to me. The Honda Today also has a special place in my heart ♥.

For most people, it seems that 14 is about the limit without premium. Seriously though, if you even get a single assist at tier 4 in any plane except for the H6K4 (heavy tier 2/3 bomber, very high repair cost) you leave with a profit. I have never had premium and I am currently at tier 7 or 8 for all countries except for the US because I do not really like their planes.  Sadly it still seems that the devs have their heads up their asses. The big complaint is currently that it is impossible to play high tier planes because of repair costs, but instead of fixing that they are upping the repair costs and lowering the starting cost of the plane.

The award-winning documentary film Rape Culture made by Margaret Lazarus in 1975 takes credit for first defining the concept.  Also can be read on-line at the [Blackwell On-line service - Rape Culture - Prof Joyce Williams](http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2012_chunk_g978140512433124_ss1-19)  Then she can read about the film and the work of Prisoners Against Rape Inc 1973, the support for these men from The Black Panthers in the USA, The Feminist Alliance Against Rape and others - including the prison authorities which allowed them to form a None-Profit/Charity.

Is your friend racists and does she support racism? Note that it was Black women who started working with the prisoners, and then when you look at the film then black women are missing. How did that happen?   1) Ask her if she was told how rape was defined - and if the people at this meeting even know how the statistics they are dealing with have been derived and even where from?   Then show here the gerrymangerng that has gone on with people such as Mary Koss and Ms Magazine - As Christine Hoff Sommers pointed out in her 1994 book ... Researchers decided what rape is not the people they are asking and decide people have been raped when they have not.  From [Researching the ""Rape Culture"" of America, Dr. Christina Hoff Sommers](http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html) 1994  &gt; in the Ms./Koss study was that the majority of women she classified as having been raped did not believe they had been raped. Of those Koss counts as having been raped, only 27 percent thought they had been; 73 percent did not say that what happened to them was rape. In effect, Koss and her followers present us with a picture of confused young women overwhelmed by threatening males who force their attentions on them during the course of a date but are unable or unwilling to classify their experience as rape. Does that picture fit the average female undergraduate? For that matter, does it plausibly apply to the larger community? As the journalist Cathy Young observes, ""Women have sex after initial reluctance for a number of reasons . . . fear of being beaten up by their dates is rarely reported as one of them.""  2) Then refer her to 2008 [HEATHER MAC DONALD, The Campus Rape Myth The reality: bogus statistics, feminist victimology, and university-approved sex toys](http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html)  &gt;The campus rape industry’s central tenet is that one-quarter of all college girls will be raped or be the targets of attempted rape by the end of their college years (completed rapes outnumbering attempted rapes by a ratio of about three to two). The girls’ assailants are not terrifying strangers grabbing them in dark alleys but the guys sitting next to them in class or at the cafeteria.  &gt;An army of salesmen took to the road, selling advice to administrators on how to structure sexual-assault procedures, and lecturing freshmen on the “undetected rapists” in their midst. Rape bureaucrats exchanged notes at such gatherings as the Inter Ivy Sexual Assault Conferences and the New England College Sexual Assault Network. Organizations like One in Four and Men Can Stop Rape tried to persuade college boys to redefine their masculinity away from the “rape culture.” The college rape infrastructure shows no signs of a slowdown. In 2006, for example, Yale created a new Sexual Harassment and Assault Resources and Education Center, despite numerous resources for rape victims already on campus.  UK Specific Resources:   BBC - Radio 4 - [Rape Stats - 28/08/2009 Is Britain's record on prosecuting rape is as bad as headlines suggest?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b00m74g6)  BBC - News ""[Understanding rape statistics  - The conviction rate for rape in England and Wales is notoriously low](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/more_or_less/8213670.stm)"".  You say ""70% of rapes are unreported"" - but by basic logic if they are not reported then the number of unreported has to be Zero! Anything over the Zero is an estimate and it needs solid researches and data to make the claim ... so what data and research is being used, is it valid and are the reports being given honestly or Woozled?   Also Woozle Effect - ""[Definitions And Operation](http://reference.avoiceformen.com/wiki/Woozle_effect)"" and [More to come on AVfM Monday 24 Jun 2013](http://www.avoiceformen.com/author/imnotmrabut/)    Note the words of Donald Dutton 2006  &gt; ""Woozles are usually not simply a matter of authentic misreporting.

I have used Gentoo for quite some time and left it for Arch for reasons that have nothing to do with being a ""fault"" of Gentoo. (Well maybe the drama queen fight, but those thing die off on their own.)  That being said, let me go over you list:  1. Pacman - All the good things out of portage without the revdep-rebuilds. PKGBUILDS are 342% easier than ebuilds, including hyperbole. (They are more simple bash-script style, without all the eapi ceremony.) 2. Arch repos + AUR - A central place for user packages and no large scale proliferation of repositories. Smaller hurdle to entry for user-supplied packages (looking at you, sunrise). 3. Stable as brick **and** bleeding edge like a katana - Packages tend to work as-is since Arch keeps as close to upstream as possible. If something breaks, ""blame [Allan](http://www.reddit.com/user/allanbrokeit)""™. The use of binary packages also means, it at least compiled on the dev's machine. (There was some discussion about sparky(?) putting ebuilds into core repos without even trying to build them a while ago on the Gentoo ML). 4. The Arch wiki got a jump start on Gentoo when they their own wiki asploded. The seem to be pretty much on par again now. And it seems the Gentoo wiki is finally managed by infra... about time. 5. I used to obsess about USE flags. My paludis use.conf actually measured in kb at the end, micromanaging every little feature and dependency there was. Then I realized **YAGNI**, most USE flags go on about minor details and/or supporting little used features. Seriously, in 99% of cases you will just be fine with the defaults. It also adds to the problem of no two Gentoo installs being the same and all the annoyance (i.e. stuff not working as intended) that comes with it.  Gentoo is a fine distro and it would still be my 2nd choice after Arch for personal use, but I think I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't specifically ask about it. (Neither would I do that with Arch, I tend to suggest Mint or LMDE to the people jumping ship from Windows and Debian to those that wand to move from Ubuntu to the grown up  table. ;))",™

t5_2r8cd,scinut71,1372030422,"According to the wiki:   Doctor Who   ◾A random citizen will sometimes say ""I'm missing the new episode of Constable What!"", a parody of Doctor Who.    ◾After blowing up the dam in ""Hell Hath No Fury"" Jack will list four names of workers killed in the flooding, all of which are the names of the first four actors playing the Doctor in Doctor Who. These are William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, and Tom Baker.    ◾At the beginning of the game Claptrap says ""Allons-y!"", which the 10th Doctor from Doctor Who is known to say.    ◾The NPCs constantly knocking on walls in Sanctuary seem to be doing so in a similar beat and fashion to the subliminally-controlled humans in the Doctor Who episode ""The Sound of Drums."" The Master also refers to Captain Jack Harkness as ""Handsome Jack"" in that episode.    ◾ECHOs found in Lynchwood bandits named 'John' and 'Barrowman' reference Doctor Who and Torchwood actor John Barrowman, who played character Jack Harkness.    ◾There is a skin for Maya called Rose Tailor, a play on the character Rose Tyler from Doctor Who.    ◾In the Bloodshot Ramparts, there is a small platform aside a crane that has a teddy bear with a bow tie and 3-D glasses, which is a possible reference to the series for the 10th Doctor wearing 3-D glasses in an episode, and the 11th Doctor's fondness of bow ties.    ◾Hyperion robots can often be heard uttering ""Deleted!"" which is a popular phrase of the Doctor Who enemy, the Cybermen.    ◾In the character selection screen, CL4P-TP sometimes says, ""I need to pee,"" which will trigger him to go into the outhouse. Said outhouse will then vanish, and pop back up, much in the same manner of the Doctor's TARDIS    ◾The character Maya was given to the Order of the Impending Storm, a play off of the nickname Oncoming Storm, given to the Doctor by the Daleks ",◾

In addition, I've made sure to back everything up necessary to recreate this site (and its downloads) should it go down 😁  At the moment I'm tinkering to see if I can adjust the bundle identifier and have more than one installed. I don't think the code signature in the ipa includes the Info.plist bundle details but I could be wrong.  **Edit:**  Ah, I've found the limiter. Yes - the Info.plist isn't included in the signed application binary, but because this is enterprise distribution it requires an *embedded* mobile provisioning profile (embedded.mobileprovision). This **does** contain the bundle identifier in it - and it's 100% identical (the embedded.mobileprovision file) between all the apps. A mobileprovision file like this is signed by Apple, so I'm sure they're very hesitant to get more of them.",😁

The funny thing is, his shots would garner a lot of ooh's and ahh's from the crowd because it just looked so silky and smooth.

t5_2qmtk,Typomancer,1372099952,"I would add to the online portfolio part, in the “platform” section, [Cargo Collective](http://cargocollective.com/) as an excellent platform to have your portfolio site on.  Disclaimer: I design and develop many portfolio sites for professionals around the world using Cargo. Also, a few of the examples in this article are Cargo sites, like [Malik Favre’s site](http://www.malikafavre.com/) and [Trademark™](http://www.trademark-trademark.com/).  Some more tips I’d add are as follows:  * Don’t use slideshows if possible. It may seem pretty and calm but it can get very quickly tiresome. It is especially awkward when you’re there with your client or would-be employer talking about your work and you must wait as they click-click-click through one image at a time, and it makes it annoying if they want to reference back to an image of yours. And a lot of guys hunting through portfolios value speed and clarity rather than a certain “experience” made through slideshows.  * Do **not** use a splash page. They are extremely out of date and useless—they hide your content behind an artificial door and make the user click needlessly one more time just to see it. Unless your site is from 2001 and is split between a version built entirely with Flash and a version for 56K modems (you shouldn’t be using Flash anyways), do not use a splash page.  * It is actually OK not to photograph your printed work. Instead, think about making a very believable digital copy with the help of blank templates, like those from [PSDCovers](http://www.psdcovers.com/). The benefits of this are that you’ll have much more control over consistency and quality and you won’t need to buy or borrow a very expensive camera (this is especially useful to someone who is just starting out and can’t afford lots of equipment). You may also get good marks for crafting such believable digital replicas as, most of the time, this is how you’ll pitch concepts to clients, and developing the ability or showing the proficiency will be favorable. Just look at how [Anton Repponen](http://work.repponen.com/) presents his work for a good example.",™

Why would you do that? Supreme Hanes tees are absolutely no different than regular Hanes tees, aside from that tiny little box logo tag they have on the bottom right hand corner. It's not like Supreme Hanes tees are any better quality, heavier duty than the Hanes tees you could buy at Walmart. So why would you pay extra for Supreme Hanes tees, and go out of your way to say 'Graphic printed on a Supreme/Hanes® Tagless T-Shirt' for ANY other reason than trying to piggyback off Supreme's brand recognition. I'm not saying this to be mean - I'm saying this to stop you from making a huge mistake. If you attempt to involve Supreme with your new brand in ANY WAY, you will get no respect - no one will want anything to do with your brand. Originality is important in streetwear. No one likes a biter. No one likes a brand that uses another brand's success in a misguided attempt to boost their own profile.

t5_2qkib,Spitinthacoola,1372126910,"Here's the text of their full article.  ""Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, is widely used as an active ingredient of herbicide products to control weeds in cropped and non-cropped fields around the world. In addition, glyphosate formulations have been used extensively in genetically modified glyphosate-resistant plants (Acquavella et al., 2004). The herbicidal activity of glyphosate is rather specific on the targets with the inhibition of the shikimate pathway which only presents in plants and micro-organisms (Solomon et al., 2007). Glyphosate is considered as a non toxic herbicide because of its low LD50 (the concentration that caused 50% deaths); &gt; 4 g/kg (WHO, 1994). However, the reproductive toxicities of glyphosate have been extensively studied in both animals and human. Up to now, the endocrine disrupting effects of glyphosate were not observed in the in vivo but the in vitro studies and the epidemiological studies have still conflicted in those findings due to their differences in the experimental designs, methodology and confounding factors ( Brake and Evenson, 2004, Dallegrave et al., 2007, Daruich et al., 2001, Mandel et al., 2005, Marc et al., 2004 and McDuffie et al., 2001). The synergistic effects of glyphosate and surfactants in its herbicide formulations have been concerned especially the endocrine disrupting activity (Richard et al., 2005). Most studies found that the adjuvants or surfactants in most formulations were more toxic and could enhance the toxic effects of glyphosate ( Gasnier et al., 2009, Marc et al., 2004 and Walsh et al., 2000). Glyphosate at concentrations used in agriculture (21-42 mM) was found to be toxic to human embryonic and placental cells ( Benachour et al., 2007 and Richard et al., 2005). Roundup®, a popular formulation could disrupted the synthesis of hormones in the mouse MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line ( Benachour et al., 2007 and Walsh et al., 2000). Glyphosate has been shown to disrupt the animal cell cycle in urchin eggs based on its surfactant carrying in commercial formulation (Marc et al., 2004). Recently, it was reported that at lower non toxic concentrations of Roundup and glyphosate (&lt; 1 ug/L), the main endocrine disruption is a testosterone decrease by 35%. Most potential adverse health effects were reported on the commercial glyphosate formulations. The expression of estrogen-regulated genes relating to tumor formation and tumor growth in hormone dependent human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were reported to be disrupted (Hokanson et al., 2007). Furthermore, synergistic effects between glyphosate and estrogen (17-estradiol or E2) have been demonstrated. Glyphosate was reported to have a disrupting effect on estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and beta (ERβ) transcriptional activities in HepG2 cells transiently transfected with ERE-TK-Luciferase and androgen receptor (AR) in MDA-MB453-kb2 cells (Gasnier et al., 2009). These toxic effects were reported to be more frequent with glyphosate-based herbicides than that with glyphosate alone.  This present study aims to evaluate the estrogenic effects of glyphosate alone at the range of concentrations that has been reported in environmental conditions and exposed human. Estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic effects of glyphosate were investigated and compared with endogeneous estrogen in the estrogen dependent human breast cancer cells T47D. Since glyphosate-based herbicides have been used intensively in soybean cultivation and soybean also contains the phytoestrogen, genistein, the interactive effects of these two compounds were also studied.  2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals and reagents Glyphosate (&gt;98%) was purchased from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT, USA). 17β-estradiol (E2) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

This selected concentration was considered based on the equal effects of glyphosate and genistein on cell proliferation which was about 140% of the control. The results revealed that genistein at 10-7 M significantly enhanced the cell growth effect of 10-9 M of glyphosate up to 169% of control..."" 4. Discussion The present study provides a better understanding of possible mechanisms underlying glyphosate toxicity in a hormone dependent human breast cancer cell. Concentrations of glyphosate tested in this study that exhibited estrogenic activity and interfered with normal estrogen signaling were relevant to the range of concentrations that has been reported in environmental conditions and exposed human. The detectable concentrations in human urines have been reported to be in the range of &lt;0.1 - 233 ppb (&lt;5.9 x 10-10 - 1.4 x 10-6 M) with the highest estimated systemic dose of 0.004 mg/kg (Acquavella et al., 2004 ; Jauhiainena et al., 1991).  In this study, we found that glyphosate at a log interval concentration ranging from 10-12 to 10-6 M increased the cell proliferation of a hormorne dependent breast cancer T47D cell while this effect was not observed in a hormone independent breast cancer MDA-MB231 cell. The ERE luciferase assay also supported that glyphosate behaved as a xenoestrogen to induce ERE activation because these responses can be blocked by ICI 182780, an estrogen antagonist. Although the ERs binding of glyphosate is still unknown, the ability of glyphosate to stimulate the ERE-gene transcription activity and up-regulation of ERα protein expression suggests that glyphosate may exert the stimulatory effects via the ER-dependent mechanism. As is known, ERs can bind with a wide vareity of compounds with typical structures of two hydroxyl groups separated by a rigid hydrophobic linker region and, in addition, the effective ligands possess a phenolic hydroxyl group (Ascenzi et al., 2006). Although glyphosate structure does not totally match, its responses observed in this study supported the contention that it acted like ligand binding. This unknown interaction may occur in a polar pocket at ligand binding site of ERs. Due to the hydrophilic property of glyphosate , it may access via an active phospate group. This may affect the conformation of other domains that respond to recruit other coregulators that differ from normal ER ligands. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered the levels of ER protein expression both ERα and ERβ in T47D cell at 6 h. The increased ratio of ERα / ER protein in the late stage, 24 h, corresponded to the observed proliferative effect of glyphosate. These results supported the finding about the regulatory role of ER β in T47D cells (Sotoca et al., 2008). They also demonstrated that the effects of estrogen like compounds on T47D cell proliferation were dependent on the actual ERα / ER ratio in these cells (Sotoca et al., 2008 and Speirs and Walker, 2007). Glyphosate showed a different expression profile of ERα from those estrogenic stimulation induced by E2 or genistein as previously described by Seo and coworker, 2006. They showed that E2 and genistein down-regulated ERα and enhanced ERE gene expression on MCF-7 cells (Seo et al., 2006). Different cell lines have different sensitivity to estrogen, in addition, natural estrogen and estrogen-mimicking chemicals also exert a differential regulatory effect on ERα and ERβ (Cappelletti et al., 2003). This present study revealed that glyphosate treatment induced both ERs. However, patterns of ERα and ERβ induction by glyphosate were different. Glyphosate induced rapid activation of ERβ while activation of ERα was slower but prolonged. We hypothesized that glyphosate may behave like weak xenoestrogen which can activate both subtypes of ER but with a different time course.  On the other hand, our finding contradicts a recent study by Gasnier and his colleagues (Gasnier et al., 2009) who found the inhibition of the transcription activities of ER and ERβ in HepG2 cells by Roundup® formulation, but it was not significant with pure glyphosate. This discrepancy may be due to cell types and experimental conditions. In their study, the HepG2 cells which transiently transfected with ERE-TK-Luciferase may lack some contents making it different from E2 targeted cells like breast cancer cells (Gasnier et al., 2009). Moreover, the concentrations of glyphosate in their experiments were higher than in the present study (&gt; 10-5 M). Most of the studies used glyphosate-based fomulation while a few studies used pure glyphosate. Furthermore, the used concentrations were not environmentally relevant (Williams et al., 2012). Another study showed the non-estrogenic effect of glyphosate at 10-5 – 10-4 M in MCF-7 cells (Lin and Garry, 2000), concentration ranges which cannot be compared to our study. However, the low concentration ranges should be taken into account due to many substances including pesticides and natural nutrients exerting their effects at relatively low concentrations from pico molar to micro molar (Miodini et al., 1999, Pink and Jordan, 1996 and Safe and Papineni, 2006). The present study used pure glyphosate substance at log intervals from 10-12 to 10-6 M. These concentrations are in a crucial range which correlated to the potential biological levels at part per trillion (ppt) to part per billion (ppb) which have been reported in epidemiological studies (Acquavella et al., 2004, Lavy et al., 1992 and Mandel et al., 2005). In this present in vitro study, we showed as estrogenicity of pure glyphosate. However, further in vivo study using an animal model such as a xenograft mouse model for breast cancer will confirm the present in vitro results and provide more physiological relevant evidence.  In addition, a single agent or chemical may exhibit a weak biological activity while mixture of compounds found environmentally could produce more noticeable effect by acting synergistically (Singleton and Khan, 2003). In fact, it has been reported that the concentrations of glyphosate in the environmental compartment and food chain are further increased due to high technology of transgenic crops and fruits demonstrating high degree of tolerance to the high levels of this compound (Solomon et al., 2007). Glyphosate-resistant soy is a popular genetically modified crop which is now becoming normal agricultural practice, thus glyphosate has higher possibility of getting into living organisms via the food chain through its application (Acquavella et al., 2004 and Mandel et al., 2005). It is well known that soybean contains the phytoestrogen, genistein. Genistein acts as a weak agonist in breast tumor cells in vitro, it competes with E2 for binding to ERα protein, and induces activity of estrogen-responsive reporter gene constructs in the presence of ERα protein (Rajah et al., 2009). Thus, it should be of concern whether the contaminated glyphosate in soybean can interact with genistein causing alterations in their effects on the cellular system. In the present study, we showed that glyphosate had an additive effect with genistein in in vitro testing model. This finding should raise concern about the existence of more than one xenoestrogen such as phytoestrogen and contaminants in plant derived food which may be beneficial or harmful depending on the hormonal and pathological status of consumers. This study implied that the additive effect of glyphosate and genistein in postmenopausal woman may induce cancer cell growth. In this present in vitro study, we showed an estrogenicity of pure glyphosate.  In summary, we found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genistein which implied that the use of glyphosate-contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity.""",®

They note that there is a selection bias in most studies investigating rTMS for depression towards those that are resistant to other forms of treatment. So, if anything, I guess we might assume those results are more highly skewed towards pharmacotherapy resistant MDD. &gt;  The treatment-resistant form of major depression is a specific diagnosis, not simply ""a selection bias"". It is a finding based on specific requirements. See the Broaden Study for DBS in treatment-resistant depression. www.broadenstudy.com. That study requires, at a minimum:  &gt;You may be able to participate if you: &gt; *     Have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) *     Are between 21 and 70 years old *     Had your first depressive episode before age 45 *     Have tried at least four treatments in your current episode. For example: *         1. Medications such as Zoloft®, Prozac®, Lexapro®, Wellbutrin®, Paxil®, Effexor®, Cymbalta®, and combinations of these or other medications *         2. Psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or other talk therapies *         3. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS or rTMS) *         4. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)  Those are criteria that define treatment-resistant depression. Others may offer more casual definition but for those who truly suffer from it, this is what they are dealing with. It would be great if TMS has been clinically tested with double-blind studies and proven effective for this patient population.   My understanding is that TMS/rTMS requires at least a dozen treatment sessions and over $1,500 a pop. And the best I've heard for efficacy is ""It's worth a shot if your insurance covers it."" That's a lot of cash for a nonsurgical treatment that is little more than a machine. I'm sorry, but I have a hard time recommending that to someone really struggling against depression.   I would be the first to support it if it looked promising and affordable. Good first steps would be to get FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression and make the treatment affordable and readily available. After reading up on Brainsway and Neuronetics, the companies appear more interested in selling the marketing of their products than letting the treatment speak for itself through its results.  ",®

Here are some guidelines: &gt; &gt;* “If it ain't broke, don't fix it”: If you already use an open source operating system, and you are happy with it, there is probably no good reason to change. &gt; &gt;* BSD systems, in particular FreeBSD, can have notably higher performance than Linux. But this is not across the board. In many cases, there is little or no difference in performance. In some cases, Linux may perform better than FreeBSD. &gt; &gt;* In general, BSD systems have a better reputation for reliability, mainly as a result of the more mature code base. &gt; &gt;* BSD projects have a better reputation for the quality and completeness of their documentation. The various documentation projects aim to provide actively updated documentation, in many languages, and covering all aspects of the system. &gt; &gt;* The BSD license may be more attractive than the GPL. &gt; &gt;* BSD can execute most Linux binaries, while Linux can not execute BSD binaries. Many BSD implementations can also execute binaries from other UNIX® like systems. As a result, BSD may present an easier migration route from other systems than Linux would. &gt; From: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/explaining-bsd/comparing-bsd-and-linux.html",®

Metapod: A number of Metapod cards have their HP's listed as ""HP ##"" instead of ""## HP"". Pikachu: A number of Pikachu cards had a number of minor errors in their flavor text and image, such as the Pikachu having red cheeks. This Pikachu is the most commonly known misprint.

Water Energy: A number of these cards have no space between the margin and the water symbol, along with ""ENERGY"". Select Base Set cards: Some Base Set cards had their Energy symbols not centered. Base Set 2 Seaking: Card reads ""Put Seaking on the Stage 1 card"" when it should say ""Put Seaking on the Basic Pokémon"" Jungle 1st Edition Electrode: A number of Jungle Electrode have the image of Base Set Electrode. 1st Edition Butterfree: Due to a bubble in the printing ink, a number of Butterfree Cards were written as ""Edition d"" instead of ""Edition 1"". Rapidash and Seaking: Seaking and Rapidash are Stage 1 Pokémon but the text tells the person playing the cards to ""put XXX on the Stage 1 card"".

Fossil 1st Edition Holo Zapdos : A number of Fossil Holo Zapdos cards have a space for the evolution box punched out of the holographic foil, even though Zapdos is a Basic Pokémon. Normal Edition Holo Zapdos : A number of Fossil Holo Zapdos cards have a space for the evolution box punched out of the holographic foil, even though Zapdos is a Basic Pokémon. Team Rocket   Dark Golbat reads as ""Pokémon.Apply"" Holo Dark Arbok and Rare Dark Arbok (1st &amp; Normal Edition): Dark Arbok was printed with extra zeros and the number three was accidentally entered so it was written as ""©1999-23000 Wizards"".

Also, a number (around 5000 cards) of this card were accidentally printed as non-holographic.

Dark Rapidash: Dark Rapidash's stats lacks the word ""Length"". Grimer: English Team Rocket's Grimer's Poison Gas attack puts Pokémon to sleep, although the Japanese version Poisons them. Dark Raichu (1st and Normal Edition): Dark Raichu's Evolution Box is colored light gray instead of dark gray. Additionally, the card reads ""Put Raichu on the Basic Pokémon"" instead of ""Put Dark Raichu on the Basic Pokémon"". This wording error was fixed for the Legendary Collection reprint. Gym Heroes Rocket's Scyther: In the first attack there is incorrect extra text of ""or is evolved)."" Gym Challenge Misty's Seel (1st and Normal Edition): All prints of this card have a transparency error; there should not be a white space around Seel's tail. Blaine's Charizard (1st and Normal Edition): Early prints of these cards have a Fighting-type symbol instead of the Fire-type symbol. Also, ""energy"" is misspelt with a small ""e"" instead of a capital ""E"". Blaine's Charizard : In late print runs of the Normal Edition the Fire-type symbol was corrected but the small ""e"" in energy remained. Giovanni's Pinsir (1st and Normal Edition): Pinsir's ""Snapping Pincers"" attack is supposed to do 20+ damage and not 10+ damage. Rocket's Minefield Gym (1st and Normal Edition): Early prints of this card do not mention how many damage counters are needed to put on a Pokémon.",©

t5_2rb6c,LordIntrepid,1372148050,"&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to believe gender roles are synonymous with patriarchy.  Well, since ""human behavior"" means more than just gender roles, I will have to correct you. :P  That and I was using ""patriarchy"" in the more overused laymen usage  ""what I think it means"" form you hear when its applied as a reason for a behavior, rather than the feminist academic re-definition of the word, if that helps at all.  &gt;Patriarchy is a social system where men are given privileges, and women are silenced and oppressed.  Which is why I have trouble believing it.  &gt;I dont believe patriarchy creates gender roles, but it certainly enforces them.  I agree with this in the sense that normal human social behavior will reinforce gender roles out of pure situational necessity/convenience, on an individual basis.   &gt;I do believe in biological/psychological differences between men and women, but I also believe that we are not naturally patriarchal.  We are naturally what we are, anything else would be a conscious decision by a person/persons (they would be aware). It has just been labeled as Patriarchy™ in the past 50-70 years.  &gt; I take it you do not believe the US is a patriarchal nation. As much as I believe being christian means your a good person.  &gt;You are entitled to your thoughts, but I encourage you to do some research. Your definition of patriarchy does not touch anything factual, and instead carries **a sense of misogyny and opposition to feminists**.  I had to stop and do a double take when I read that. Is that a typo, or are you actually saying that what I said carries a sense of ""woman hating and opposition to feminists""? I've made no reference to the female gender of the human race, but I sound misogynistic? Are you sure you're using that word right? Or are you using it in the same sense I used patriarchy: none academic, almost a slang usage to be applied to idea's/opinions/behaviors that are disagree-able.   &gt;If you are a misogynist, I'm sorry for wasting your time.  See, you're throwing that word around again. As if it has any bearing on the discussion. XD  I'm sorry for wasting your time, but my previous comments where actually *half* sarcasms. They contained my opinion about feminism/patriarchy wile also being partly sarcastic in their delivery of that information.   ",™

The English word ""heart,"" written in their textbooks, is always translated 心 (kokoro), which is closer in meaning to the English ""spirit"" or ""emotional state,"" while the Japanese 心臓 (shinzou) means the organ of the body which pumps blood.

As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

t5_2qh16,JCMB,1372180759,"&gt;Mechanical designs and safety systems are MECHANICAL  [Mercedes Benz disagrees](http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-C/model-C250WZ#safety)   It can influence the steering of the car by braking one side.   &gt;With technology that monitors ordinary road markings, Lane Keeping Assist helps detect unintended drifting off-course, and alerts the driver by vibrating the steering wheel. If the driver continues to drift, it can apply the brake to a single rear wheel to help guide the car back into its lane.   It can apply the brakes with no driver action.   &gt; Adaptive braking technology integrates a suite of advances. If you lift off the accelerator quickly, Predictive Brake Priming sets the pads closer to the discs for more immediate response when you apply the brakes. In the rain, Automatic Brake Drying periodically applies the brakes just enough to sweep water build-up from the discs. During uphill starts, Hill-Start Assist helps prevent unwanted rollback. And a HOLD feature can make long red lights or stopped traffic a little easier.    It can make the car brake harder than desired by the driver.   &gt; Brake Assist senses emergency braking via the speed at which the driver presses the brake pedal and immediately applies maximum available power boost. Brake Assist can potentially reduce the overall stopping distance by eliminating the delay caused by a common human tendency not to brake hard enough, soon enough. Letting up on the brake pedal releases Brake Assist.   It can cut engine power and apply the brakes to individual wheels.   &gt; This safety breakthrough first introduced by Mercedes-Benz continually monitors your driving inputs and the vehicle's motion to help keep it going in your intended direction, especially in corners and during evasive maneuvers. If it detects wheelspin, severe understeer (plowing), or oversteer (fishtailing), ESP can brake individual wheels and reduce engine power to help bring the vehicle under control.     It can even move the driver's seat and fool with the windows.   &gt; Included with the Driver Assistance Package is another Mercedes-Benz safety breakthrough. PRE-SAFE® is a predictive occupant-protection system that helps prepare for an accident in the critical moments before it occurs. If sensors detect certain vehicle movements that indicate that an accident is possible, PRE-SAFE takes action: Reversible electronic tensioners tighten the seat belts. The occupied front passenger seat adjusts to a more favorable position for air-bag and seat-belt effectiveness, while both active front head restraints adjust for optimum protection. If severe skidding indicates that a rollover is likely, PRE-SAFE closes the side windows. If no accident occurs, the seat-belt tensioners reverse, and you simply readjust your seat, open the windows and continue on your way.   As you can see, there's a lot the car Hastings was driving could do ""on his behalf"".     What you claim used to be true, and still is of any older cars.  However, most modern cars are trending to the ""drive by wire"" for things like throttle control (i.e. no more cable), braking (those cars that automatically slow down when set on cruise control) and electronic power steering, all of which rely upon sensors to tell the software how to behave.  All you have to do is spoof the sensor and let the car's autonomous software do the rest.  In a compromised vehicle, the only things the driver would have complete control over would be the position of the steering wheel (which could have spoofed sensors) and which position the transmission was in (PRND32).    It's kind of scary to imagine what one could do if you had a way into the system.",®

I doubt that anyone listening to this recording will be able to make out the individual unique playing styles that these players are famous for. 12 drummers is indeed a novel sound for a soundtrack recording, but you'd undoubtedly run into a diminishing returns situation with this type of ensemble as far as the $$$/talent ratio goes.

Self-admission of pre-service  experimental marijuana (including organic or synthetic cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinal  (THC)) use without exposure to legal proceedings is not automatically disqualifying.  However, any use over 15 times is disqualifying. (Refer to paragraph 3.22 for drug-related  eligibility determinations [DRED].)  There is a whole section in that regulation on drug use, to include a table listing all kinds of drugs and whether a waiver is allowed or not.

t5_2qzb6,DrLaundry,1372186129,"Presoaking is a great technique to keep white items (especially those with a little spandex in them that can’t be bleached) looking like new.  I actually prefer a longer soak time, up to 8 hours, and I like presoaking with powdered Clorox2® which has enzymes, brighteners, and oxygen bleach to really improve cleaning versus detergent alone.  Setting the presoak up so items can soak overnight is also a great strategy so you aren’t waiting around—you’re sleeping—just be sure items are fully submerged in the soaking solution.  It sounds like your washer has a presoak cycle with the intermittent agitation so it moves items through the solution automatically, and that’s really helpful, too.  Yes, kids’ clothes are a huge challenge.  If it wasn’t for presoaking, every July I would have needed to replace my kids clothes because of blackberry stains! ",®

The recommended storage conditions are from 50°F (10°C) to 77°F (25°C).  from: http://www.duracell.com/media/en-US/pdf/gtcl/Technical_Bulletins/Alkaline%20Technical%20Bulletin.pdf  &gt;Alkaline cells have long shelf storage life. After one year of storage at room temperature, cells will provide 93 to 96 percent of initial capacity. When stored for four years at 70°F (21°C), service of about 85 percent is still attainable. Storage at high temperatures and high humidity will accelerate degradation of chemical cells. At low temperature storage, the chemical activity is retarded and capacity is not greatly affected. Recommended  storage conditions are 50°F (10°C) to 77°F (25°C) with no more than 65 percent relative humidity.   &gt;Figure 11 compares various DURACELL® zinc anode systems and the effect of temperature on capacity retention. At room temperature, the alkaline system loses approximately 5 percent capacity after one year of storage. Subsequent capacity loss is approximately 2 percent per year. By comparison, zinc-carbon cells lose nearly  15 percent capacity per year at room temperature. As the temperature elevates, capacity losses increase. At temperatures above 113°F (45°C), the regular zinc-carbon cells will be completely discharged within one year, whereas the alkaline system will still retain approximately 80 percent of its original capacity.",®

I was born and grow up in Reims. When I was a child, we where told not to pickup any old objects that we could find while playing outside. And tetanus vaccination was mandatory, because of potential soil contamination by old war gear and dead horses from WW1.  Still today, when you walk in the countryside, you can recognise the old battlegrounds, with their small craters in the earth from the mortars.  If your are interested in this, the latest discovery bomb discovery is in Rennes (2013-04-18) : [Rennes : une bombe de la Seconde Guerre mondiale découverte en plein centre ville ](http://www.atlantico.fr/pepites/rennes-bombe-seconde-guerre-mondiale-decouverte-en-plein-centre-ville-701742.html) (bonus: a vidéo).

PRE-SAFE® is a predictive occupant-protection system that helps prepare for an accident in the critical moments before it occurs. If sensors detect certain vehicle movements that indicate that an accident is possible, PRE-SAFE takes action: Reversible electronic tensioners tighten the seat belts. The occupied front passenger seat adjusts to a more favorable position for air-bag and seat-belt effectiveness, while both active front head restraints adjust for optimum protection. If severe skidding indicates that a rollover is likely, PRE-SAFE closes the side windows. If no accident occurs, the seat-belt tensioners reverse, and you simply readjust your seat, open the windows and continue on your way""* ( I explained this one because it sounds like a death trap to me)  Maybe one of these advanced technologies malfunctioned and caused the problem....Maybe someone knew all this stuff about Mercedes and realized it would be a fail safe way to off him.",®

Edit: [Here is the video reference.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-AEAhExuaaM)  Edit 2: It appears that person is running in windowed mode, which I believe is not the same.  Edit 3: From [AMD's Eyefinity FAQ](http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/how-to/Pages/faqs.aspx#same-resolution): Single Large Surface (SLS) mode is activated when you create an AMD Eyefinity technology display group in the AMD Catalyst™ Control Center. SLS mode combines the resolutions of all the connected displays, and then essentially “tricks” the operating system into believing that there is one display with that large combined resolution.    Dragon Age II in AMD Eyefinity technology 5x1 portrait mode. Spanning the game to all five monitors would not be possible without SLS.  While SLS mode does not require all monitors to be of the same resolution, SLS mode will force each monitor to match the smallest resolution on any of the displays you’re combining. For example, a 1680x1050 monitor paired with two 1920x1200 monitors will force the 1920x1200 monitors to 1680x1050 before they’re combined for a final SLS resolution of 5040x1050. For this reason, we do strongly encourage all monitors to have, at the very least, the same resolution. Provided you meet this technical requirement, we think you’ll find the effect of SLS to be absolutely breathtaking.",™

t5_2qhv1,xiian,1372275930,"**Upstream** is the repository that you forked from. It can be a good idea to add this repo as a remote on your local checkout to make it easier to fetch changes ""from upstream"" to work with. The name ""upstream"" is just a convention, and you could easily call it ""organization_repo"" or ""wonderimpornium"" or whatever you'd like.   ---  To **rebase** is to rewrite history. It's one of those polarizing concepts in the git world because it's awesomely powerful and cool. Some folks feel like you shouldn't rebase *ever* since it has the possibility to fuck up everything. Other folks (like myself) engage in rebasing multiple times a day, sometimes with multiple partners. With great power comes great responsibility, yadda yadda yadda.   Let's say you have a repo like this:  A - B - ***C***  where C is where master is on the remote (hence the bolding) and the local (hence the italics). You do some work locally and make a few commits before pushing the changes upstream (see the vocab callback there?). So your local repo looks like this:  A - B - **C** - D - E - *F*  where C is where master is on the remote, and F is where master is locally.   You've been pushing forward progress and making things awesome. Now it's time to share those 3 awesome commits (D, E &amp; F) with the world. The first thing you do is fetch any new work that anyone else has done. But uh oh... that rat-bastard Bob has performed some commits *too*! So now the state of the repo looks like this:  A - B - C - D^Bob - E^Bob - F^Bob - **G**^Bob  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\  D - E - *F*  What to do, what to do? Bob has done all this work without you, and you need to get caught up before you share your work with the world.  The aforementioned folks who feel like you should *never* rebase would say that you should perform a merge of Bob's code into your code, and then push. But this results in a **merge commit** like so:  A - B - C - D^Bob - E^Bob - F^Bob - G^Bob - ***H***  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\  D - E - F -------------------/  Where H is a new merge commit, joining your history and Bob's history and allowing future work to be done with this common ancestry.  ---  Merge commits aren't inherently bad, and they don't litter up the commit history *too* much, but there is one thing that grinds my gears about them.  Let's say that both you and Bob were working on the WidgetConfig system of the app, and you happen to both add a new parameter to a method. You've added `$price` and he has added `$discount`. Aside from the single line of the method parameter declaration, your work does not intersect (his changes are at the end of the method, and yours are at the end).  Git will see that method parameter declaration as a conflict because it can't be asked/trusted to determine which of you is correct. So, when you attempt to do your merge, git will complain about a conflict and refuse to go further until you act. So you go ahead and make the change, ensuring that both `$price` and `$discount` are in the signature and making sure that wherever that method is called it is sorted as well. Then you commit. Your merge goes forward and all seems right in the world.   Except (and this is the gear grinding bit) now you have changes associated with some earlier commit (commit D, where you added that parameter) being changed again in some later commit (this new merge commit created). Looking at that conflict resolution commit doesn't tell you much (and all too many people like to have a commit message along the lines of ""merge conflicts"" which is oh-so-helpful), so now you have to go digging deeper in order to figure out why `$price` was added, hopefully eventually finding commit D, with the helpful commit message of ""adding $price calculation to appease marketing. See ticket #37""  ---  Compare this with rebasing.  When you see that Bob has made changes, you think ""Okay, his changes are in the system, now I need to add my changes too"" so you effectively just take your commits (D, E &amp; F) and apply them on top of Bob's changes. What you are technically doing is saying that you want the base of that specific chain of commits (D, E &amp; F), to no longer be C, but instead want the base to be G^Bob. What you end up with is this:  A - B - C - D^Bob - E^Bob - F^Bob - G^Bob - D - E - ***F***  Simple, clean, clear and allows for easy reading of the commit history.  ---  **But what of that conflict I mentioned earlier?** Bob's addition of `$discount` which caused such problems? That conflict will now be picked up when git is attempting to apply commit D to G^Bob. Git will see that there is a problem and FreakTheFuckOut™ and not proceed any further. This might seem bad, but it allows for you to *change that commit before moving on*. Read that again, it's worth it. Git allows you to change a commit you made in the past and keep moving on without majorly messing up your day.   Now that you know that Bob's changes conflict with your changes, you do the same sort of fixes you did before to make everything copacetic and commit the changes. The difference is that now commit D takes into account Bob's changes. Your conflict (and shame) is hidden from history. Nobody needs to know that you had this conflict, because nobody cares. They care that ticket #37 was put in because marketing wanted `$price` to be calculated. And that is what they will see with your commit message.  --- --- --- A long ass response to only part of your question, but I love me some rebasing action and know that it can be super powerful and awesome. I highly advise setting `branch.autosetuprebase always` in your `.gitconfig` and reaping the benefits as soon as possible.  ",™

This is cheaper than the OPs post, and doesnt include artificial sweeteners. * The 330 gram version has 165g of BCAA, 66g of Glutamine, and a mere 11grams of Beta alanine (which is pointless if you ask me).  This, combined with a natural sweetener and somewhat delicious flavoring, makes this a no-brainer for me.  Before this, I was buying bulk BCAA and mixing it with Ultima® naturally flavored/sweetened electrolyte drink.  This is about the same price, comes pre-mixed, and tastes great. * Dissolves better than any BCAA mix I've used. * If you've never used Drugstore.com, you can get $10 off your first purchase.

t5_2cneq,Nightlight,1372284656,"As it happens I know a prostitute (not professionally) and she works with several other women who share an apartment for business, there's no pimp, no drugs, no beatings, it's a job.   Business comes from the internet, it's apparently very discreet, and the 'Johns' apparently play by the rules.  Maybe in pre-internet days a pimp was required for 'security' and to take care of rhe rent, or whatever, but they just don't seem to be needed today, pay the rent, pay for internet adds, where's a pimp in that equasion?  My impression is that if someone makes trouble they just call the cops, which pretty much means that end to that rental agreement, but apparently the cops do come and arrest people when needed.  Appanently that doesn't happen very often.  I'm not an expert here and I've never actually questioned her about the whole thing, this is just based on comments in other contexts.  Also another source of ~~prostitutes~~ sex workers is from young women who come to the US on student visas, make some money, and return to their homes when they have enough money (or get their visas cancled, whatever).  The whole thing was pretty surprising.  **Edit:** The whole 'pimp' thing probably came from the days of street hookers... I live in NY City and back in the late 70s/early 80s you could find street hookers a block from Times Square, which is pretty much Disneyland™ today... semi naked women used to inhabit the West side of 14th St, a neighborhood which is not only gentrified but quite exclusive, with shops that I pretty much can't affort.  It's a different world.  **Another Edit:**  When I way 'you could find hookers' I didn't mean I was looking for them, if you' were in that neighborhood it was hard not to miss them.",™

We went from living together everyday to living separately. I only seen him when we went out on dates. We called each other. We really started our relationship all over. And it was wonderful. And necessary because we hurt each other a lot in the course of our addictions. It was incredibly painful at times because I wasn't used to being alone and I was struggling with getting clean. But we moved back in together shortly after I got clean with the promise that no drugs would enter our house again. To this day we've been good. We got married earlier this year actually.

The team compared a CPU/GPU implementation in OpenCL™ against an HSA implementation. The HSA version seamlessly shares data between CPU and GPU, without memory copies or cache flushes because it assigns each part of the workload to the most appropriate processor with minimal dispatch overhead. The net result was a 2.3x relative performance gain at a 2.4x reduced power level*. This level of performance is not possible using only multicore CPU, only GPU, or even combined CPU and GPU with today’s driver model. Just as important, it is done using simple extensions to C++, not a totally different programming model.",™

t5_2qh33,MrAsshole2you,1372339476,"From the article, since you didn't bother to read: ""In response to this need, Verinata is proud to offer the verifi® prenatal test, a non-invasive test that detects multiple fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. The test detects three primary chromosomal aneuploidies for trisomies 21, 18 and 13 from a single blood draw as early as 10 weeks estimated gestational age."" This is what's called a fact. It will not change for you no matter how hard you try.   While we're on this subject, though, allow me to play Devil's advocate. What gives anyone the right to decide who lives and dies bases solely on risk factors of undesirable traits? Where do we draw the line? In China, a vagina is an undesirable trait.  You're right about one thing though. I'm not a big fan of abortion. Bill Clinton once said that abortion should be ""safe, available, and rare."" If a woman has been raped, she needs to report it and let the police investigate. If a person is to be deemed responsible enough to make the  life or death decision of another, they must also be responsible enough to perform their duty to society. I am sympathetic to the victims, but shame alone is not enough to excuse allowing a rapist to go free and to kill a child. An adolescent pregnancy should always be investigated as rape or molestation because, by definition, that's what it is. IMO, society took a giant leap backwards by allowing kids to purchase PlanB OTC. Now, I do not think it should be unavailable, but a crime has been committed and should be pursued as such. Current law allows these serious crimes to be covered up. Women wait 26 weeks because they can no longer hide that they are pregnant.   No part of this law closes any abortion clinics. It simply requires any clinic to have a legitimate doctor and be within 30 miles of a hospital should something go wrong. That is not too much to ask. According to the CIA World Fact Book, more women die due to unsafe abortions (13%) than a direct result of child birth (8%).    I am still struggling to grasp the concept of the health of the child being  a reason to argue **for** abortion. Last I heard, death was pretty damn unhealthy.",®

That is, I was focused on the theory, not the statistics. If they had a direct or sibling causal link I think we would see a stronger correlation than we do.  So I had two points basically. One where you first came in was saying that J and P types are in general too different to suggest a significant causal link between ADHD↔NP &amp; autism↔NJ when the correlation we see is so weak. Second when you claimed N was important... I don't think so, because I see roughly the same correlation between ADHD↔SP and autism↔SJ. Which suggests extraverted Perceiving functions are generalizable together to the extent that they are related to ADHD, and introverted ones likewise to Autism.  Though my sources for these correlations are just anecdote for now. It's also possible that they have multiple sibling or other second-degree causal links that are worth investigating, but I don't think that is what scwildbunny was getting at.

(Sorry for the rough ""mirror""  **Companions 101: Corso Riggs**  *“A sky full of stars... a new planet waiting across the galaxy.... It never gets old.”*  Welcome to our latest blog in our Companions 101 series. If you missed our previous blogs, I am Courtney Woods, Community Production Specialist, and I will be your guide as we learn more about the Companions of The Old Republic™! This series is meant to supplement our Companions HoloNet Page and provide insights, background information, and tips for the featured Companion. We will be rotating between Imperial and Republic Companions. Our last blog featured Bounty Hunter Companion, Mako, so we are returning to the Republic to focus on the farm boy, Corso Riggs. You can post your suggestions for Companions to be featured in our next blog in this official forum thread as well as on Twitter, Facebook, and reddit. Keep in mind that our next Companion will be from the Sith Inquisitor class as we have yet to focus on a Companion from that class. You may still vote for other Companions, but it will be a part of the second round of the Companion 101 series.   **Please Note: This blog contains spoilers for the Smuggler class story.**   **Meeting Corso Riggs**  Charming and chivalrous, Corso Riggs is an old fashioned farm boy ready to embark on an epic space adventure. Nothing makes him happier than storming into a bad guy’s hideout, bravely saving the damsel in distress, and finishing the day off with a glass of Corellian red. From his cheerful personality, you would never guess that he’s actually a mercenary, who lost his family during a separatist raid on Ord Mantell. This tragedy changed Corso, imbuing a dark side to his otherwise optimistic personality. He vowed to take revenge against the group of separatists who murdered his family, which eventually led him to become a mercenary for the gangster, Viidu. Despite his hardships, he carries himself with a daring attitude which has helped him to survive countless close encounters, although that same attitude seems to attract constant danger.  *“Thanks for saving my hide, Captain.”*  Corso first met the Smuggler while they were making a run to Ord Mantell. Both were betrayed by their colleague, Skavak, the Smuggler losing their ship and Corso his precious blaster, “Torchy” (A genuine BlasTech ALT-25 with magnatomic adhesion grip and side-mounted rangefinder). Having a common enemy, it made sense for Corso and the Smuggler to team up against Skavak. But was there something in particular about the Captain that made Corse want to leave Ord Mantell and become a part of his/her crew? Lead Writer Hall Hood sheds some light on Corso’s reasoning behind joining the Smuggler:  *“Corso has always felt most comfortable acting as the trustworthy backup for a strong leader, and there aren’t many people in the galaxy with a stronger personality than the Captain. They also have a lot in common: a need to live according to their own rules, a powerful wanderlust to explore the galaxy, a spirit of romance, and a deep-rooted hatred for that thieving scum Skavak. What begins as a partnership founded on seeking revenge eventually grows into a true friendship—even though the Captain doesn’t always make the moral choices and judgment calls Corso would prefer.”*  **Understanding Corso**  Corso is an adventurer who loves the excitement that life can bring, seeing each new challenge thrown his way as another chance for to prove himself. He has spent his life escaping one scrap only to find himself in the middle of another. However, the fact that he has always been victorious or at least gotten away has instilled an “I can do anything” positive attitude in Corso as well as a bit of fearlessness. He is easy going, who is quick to laugh, and always ready to play the hero. Corso is also a walking encyclopedia when it comes to weapons. Name any blaster in the galaxy and he can rattle off details as if he made the weapon himself.  So why does a fun-loving, laid back farm boy like Corso choose to become a mercenary? After the death of his family, it’s not surprising that Corso has no love for separatists, but why did he choose to join Viidu’s gang and lead the life of a hired gun instead of joining the Republic Army? Hall Hood gives us some answers:  *“The people of Ord Mantell are rugged individuals who value their personal freedoms. They tend to be loners rather than joiners, and have a low tolerance for bureaucracy. Corso is no different, which is why he has never been good at signing-up with groups or organizations that he isn’t free to leave immediately. Corso tried to enlist in the Republic Army to fight Ord Mantell’s separatists, but when he realized he might be assigned to guard medical supplies on Dantooine instead of fighting for his own homeworld, he quickly deleted his application. At least mercenary work ensured he could keep shooting at separatists on his own terms.”*  Corso’s loyalty to his people and his friends is a strong feature of his personality. The longer he stays with someone, the stronger his loyalty and his willingness to fight for them becomes. If you can gain his trust, he will fly with you to the farthest reaches of the galaxy without hesitation. In a way, he is constantly trying to fill the void that was left after losing his family. He has a hard time accepting the seediness of the galaxy and the darkness that lies within all individuals, including himself. By joining the Smuggler, Corso has begun to find his way in life and make up for some of the mistakes he has made in the past.  **Permission to Seek Your Hand**  *“Captain, it would be my great pleasure if you’d share this bottle with me. Maybe somewhere… private.”*  Corso definitely has a soft spot for the ladies. But it would be untrue to call him a womanizer – he is an old fashioned gentleman through and through. Should any female Smuggler wish to pursue a relationship with Corso, they will find him eager, but he will want to do things properly. This means “courting” the Captain with love letters, chocolates, and some vintage wine. Corso isn’t going to skimp on the Captain, so I asked Hall Hood, how would this chivalrous gentleman treat her on an all expense paid date?  *“Corso saves twenty percent of every credit he earns for the sole purpose of treating his lady to a grand night out at least once a week. He gained an appreciation for the finer things in life while working for Viidu on Ord Mantell, learning about the best foods, beverages and entertainments the galaxy has to offer. Though he would never admit it, Corso is an excellent dancer once he removes his bulky combat armor and has won multiple competitions in the nightclubs of Nar Shaddaa. When the Captain wants to get away from the big cities, Corso keeps a handy list of remote wilderness areas filled with natural beauty and enough dangerous predators so he and the Captain can get a little target practice together.”*  As you can see, a romance with Corso will be full of adventures. Of course there will be bumps along the way, but you can smooth those over with some Weapons and Military Gear.  **Life on the XS Freighter**  The life of a Smuggler will bring Corso and the Captain in contact with a variety of different species, cultures, and planets. Each of the Companions that join the Smuggler’s crew is unique and has very distinct views and opinions. Corso is pretty laid back, but is there anyone on the crew that rubs him the wrong way? Hall Hood gives some details on Corso’s relationship with the rest of the crew:  *“Corso and Risha have a complicated relationship, to say the least. On the one hand, Corso is driven to be respectful and chivalrous toward Risha. On the other hand, he knows she would use him as reactor shielding at the first opportunity if it meant saving her own skin. Corso will never mistreat Risha, but that doesn’t mean he trusts her. He’s still convinced she’ll betray the Captain someday; he just hopes he’ll be around to stop her.*  *Despite his initial skepticism of bringing a Wookiee aboard the Captain’s starship, Corso and Bowdaar have become good friends. They often chase each other around the ship’s corridors to let off a little steam, which annoys the other crewmates to no end. Corso knows just enough Mando’a to recognize that Akaavi calling him an ad’ika is an insult, but he takes her grouchy glares with good humor and locks the door to his sleeping quarters at night just in case. Corso put Guss on notice to stay out of his belongings after finding the Mon Calamari posing in the mirror with Corso’s favorite blaster—a moment that embarrassed Guss even more than it angered Corso.”*  **The Many Faces of Corso**  Companions have always been an important aspect to BioWare games and it is no different with The Old Republic. However, since Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ is an MMO, the developers felt like a feature had to be added so that the player felt like there was uniqueness to their Companions. This is where Companion Customizations come into play. These customizations are purely aesthetic, leaving your choices in game to influence your Companion’s personality, but it is a great feature to further shape your own Star Wars™ saga.  Corso has eight standard customizations as well as a special Rakghoul customization from our Rakghouls Pandemic event. Check out the screenshots below! Is Corso your favorite Companion? Share some of your best moment with him in this thread.  To learn more about Corso including statistics, background information, and his gift preferences, check out the Companions page on the HoloNet!  You can also suggest your favorite Companions to be featured in our next Companions 101 by letting us know in this thread. We will be rotating between Republic and Imperial Companions, so be sure to show your support! We’ll be choosing the next Companion based on the amount of interest shown in the previously mentioned thread as well as Twitter, Facebook, and reddit!",™

You can just add the base brigade tags for battles:    _1stRddt _Name    Just join TS when it's almost battle time, or 30 minutes beforehand for a possible pre-battle practice. The rest you need to know will be given over TS, such as server info / password, going spec when you first join, what faction to go, etc.   **^Also ^make ^sure ^your ^character ^has ^a ^*brave* ^*mustache*™** **^or ^you ^will ^fail ^inspection.**",™
t5_2rn3p,TychoCelchuuu,1372377726,"There are many ways to deal with this.  **If you know where it is:** Rush it before it can set up, either just by running straight at it before your opponent knows what's going on or by using TrueSight™ and a nearby obstruction to get close while undetected. If you can't catch it with a flank or catch it setting up, just ignore that part of the map until you can deal with it, either by flanking it or using indirect fire or bringing in a Clown Car or Oorah'ing from close in and tossing a Molotov or hopping in a nearby building or Hitting the Dirt right before it opens up on you or dropping smoke or rushing out a T-70. Once you've ignored it for a little while, you won't know whether it's still there, so proceed to:  **If you don't know where it is:** Predict where it is going to go and get there before your opponent does, then when you see it coming, see above. Your opponent is likely to send it to choke points, fuel points, and well-situated buildings. If you think you have lots of time (that is, you know they have an MG but it recently retreated or it's on the other side of the map) but you have a fairly good idea that it might head somewhere later, lay some mines or barbed wire. Make parts of the map more hostile to machine guns while no machine gun is present. Hell you can even set up Tripwire Flares.  Between Oorah, Molotovs, TrueSight™, Hit the Dirt, the AT gun's anti-infantry barrage, Clown Cars, and mines, Russians have lots of options to deal with MGs.  A final tip: literally all of your weapon teams own MG-42s. Snipers can pick them off with little trouble, mortars annihilate them, AT guns can barrage them or even just pick them off with normal shots (AT guns outrange MG-42s), and worst of all, Maxim machineguns can literally roll up to an MG-42, set up, start firing, and win the fight, thanks to the magic of 6 man squads and the fact that being suppressed doesn't really seem to interfere with the Maxim man's firing abilities.",™

I concur.)  The stars changed, Whateley.  Imagine your body cut away from your head, leaving you a lump of flesh on a chill marble slab, blinking and choking. That was what it was like. The party was over.  It killed us.  So we wait here below.  Dreadful, eh?  Not at all. I don't give a nameless dread. I can wait.  I sit here, dead and dreaming, watching the ant-empires of man rise and fall, tower and crumble.  One day -- perhaps it will come tomorrow, perhaps in more tomorrows than your feeble mind can encompass -- the stars will be rightly conjoined in the heavens, and the time of destruction shall be upon us: I shall rise from the deep and I shall have dominion over the world once more.  Riot and revel, blood-food and foulness, eternal twilight and nightmare and the screams of the dead and the not-dead and the chant of the faithful.  And after?  I shall leave this plane, when this world is a cold cinder orbitting a lightless sun. I shall return to my own place, where the blood drips nightly down the face of a moon that bulges like the eye of a drowned sailor, and I shall estivate.  Then I shall mate, and in the end I shall feel a stirring within me, and I shall feel my little one eating its way out into the light.  Um.  Are you writing this all down, Whateley?  Good.  Well, that's all. The end. Narrative concluded.  Guess what we're going to do now? That's right.  We're going to feed the shoggoth.     © Neil Gaiman 1986",©

If so, their working model is as flawed as the Death Star and it's small exhaust port.  Years ago I found myself temping for a large, multi-national HR consulting firm.  In addition to advising large corporations on things like executive compensation packages (make them larger!), they also advised large defense contractors like Morton Thiocol, Hughes Aircraft, and GE how to exit their union personnel from expensive health care plans and enter them in crappy plans like the ones we all know and hate today.  We tested the software that would be used at kiosks where people would apply for the new plans.  It was very labor intensive as we had to enter all the indicative data from large stacks of paper for each employee into Excel spreadsheets that were then used by the developers to migrate data.  Our supervisors for this work were two young girls fresh out of university with no supervisory experience.  It was their job to manage the spreadsheets except they were unfamiliar with Excel.  So was I at the time; however, our motley bunch of recently unemployed temps did include some people with decent skills, and the girls readily assigned us basically the task of managing ourselves.  Meanwhile, on a weekly basis they flew to destinations like Boston, Philidelphia, and the West Coast where they would stay in The Four Seasons, or the Hyatt, receive massages from the spa and dinner out at a fine restaurant. They would then turn over our spreadsheets to their superiors.  Sometimes we would go for three or four days with nothing to do and no direction, stuck on the 20th floor of a high rise in a windowless conference room.  We groused and they moved us to a room with a spectacular view.  I got very good at crossword puzzles.  We earned just over minimum wage.  The girls advanced in their careers rapidly although they never got good at Excel.  The work got done and I managed to snag a real job along the way, but lost it and others too until I finally managed to start my own business eventually.  I know for a fact that the massive task of surveilling the citizens of the US is probably being handled the same way.  It is a staggering amount of work to intercept Everything and analyze it.  It is being done by overworked and underpaid third party contractors and, who knows, possibly temps.  If suddenly there was to be a spike in intercepts requiring more attention, their jury-rigged system could be quickly overwhelmed, and a real discussion on our right to privacy could be engaged.  All it would take is a Million Terrorist March™ to effectuate this.  Faced with the task of increasing the tempo of operations in intelligence gathering.  Their 3rd party sourced operations would quickly dissolve into a big mess and we could get on with our lives.  Or we can continue to stay ""safe"" and do nothing at all, which is exactly what I believe will happen regardless.  Now, lets go see if we can get a free copy of Kanye's new album, shall we?",™

t5_2qh74,Xeraniac,1372449895,"The main reason I'm opposed to most ""cardistry"" type flourishing is that it's pointless and ugly. Jugglers and acrobats have access to many levels of physical impressiveness and emotional pitch. You can do a juggling routine like Chris Bliss, or you can be like Penn and use broken bottles. Or try to be a Galchenko and juggle every club on earth simultaneously. All of these routines are radically different in terms of their overall look as well as their function as entertainment.   Multipacket cuts, at least in their current stage of development, do not have the same aesthetic range. Nor do they remotely approach the sheer impact of juggling broken bottles or large numbers of objects. Elegant and beautiful flourishes can be impressive, but only (I think) as a momentary curiosity.   As for spectators using flourishes to rationalize the tricks, I think it's mostly going to be an issue if you flourish compulsively. A few people might explain things away with them, but who knows what they would have grabbed onto otherwise? Then main reason to keep things simple is to make sure all of your actions are deliberate and everything you do is chosen with the spectators in mind, not how cool it *feels* to do an eighteen-packet Ouroboros™ cut.    tl;dr ""Cardistry"" is mostly dumb because it's *boring and ugly,* not because any significant number of people are going to believe that you accomplished Card Warp by doing a left-handed aerial hatefuck.

t5_2qhwy,Trekky0623,1372454699,"Natural language is not ideally structured for logic. Because the verb *to be* is often negated through the use of *not* **following** the verb, and _X_ can be negated with *not* **preceding** it, this means that the sentence can either read:  E ↔ ¬X _“Everyone ***is*** not X.”_  OR  ¬(E ↔ X) _“Everyone ***is not*** X.”_  On the other hand, “Not everyone is X,” can only mean one thing, and that is ¬(E ↔ X).  If this were another verb where _not_ **precedes** the verb, it is more clear:  “Everyone does not run.”  VS  “Not everyone runs.”  EDIT: An example to clarify. *Not* usually cannot modify nouns. For example, you can’t say, “I met a not crook,” or “I met not a crook.” So, when Nixon says, “I am not a crook,” what words is *not* modifying?",↔

t5_2s8bl,OliveBranchMLP,1372461911,"""SO AWESOME"" ≠ ""not a brony shoutout""  ^Yes, ^that's ^a ^double ^negative.  ""Correlation doesn't imply causation"" is a concept I'm intimately familiar with, and I like to think I have enough restraint to recognize when something is just general continuity humor (i.e. party cannon) vs when it's targeted specifically at us. After all, I'm cognizant of the fact that 1.) we are not the target demographic, and 2.) we as a fandom tend to exaggerate our own importance. But even with these things in mind, you can't deny that there's a good deal of humor in the movie that was, indeed, targeted *specifically* at us. It'd take a huge leap of logic to claim otherwise.  Sure, the above example happens to *also* be a continuity thing, but the fact that she makes that *exact* expression that is used in all of the brony image macros referencing that line (there are other frames that would have made much more sense, such as the one used in the emote here on Reddit), coupled with the fact that the line is otherwise completely unremarkable and would have stayed that way had bronies not made it into such a big deal, is *more* than enough to accurately infer that said humor was influenced by the fandom.  To say nothing of:  * The deliberate inclusion of Derpy (we were the ones who made her a Big Deal™) * Her obsession with muffins (which, again, was based off of *one single line* that went viral due to bronies) * Scootaloo's chicken dance (again, association based on one viral line) * Vinyl Scratch's glasses removal (bronies went nuts the last time this happened)  And much more.  Could these have been attributed solely to continuity? Sure. Would they have been included on that basis alone? *Highly* unlikely. There's not enough incentive to do so on that basis alone.  On the other hand, there are certainly *plenty* of things that probably would have been included regardless of the fandom, including:   * Vinyl Scratch's appearance in general * Big Mac's ""eeyup"" * The aforementioned party cannon * Spike's mustache scene * Twilight's crazy dancing * The short Pinkamena shot  Their inclusion can very likely be attributed mostly to continuity, but it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that bronies had at least a *minor* influence on the decision to include and finalize these continuity references. Not enough for it to be significant, sure, but enough for the writers/storyboarders to have had put it down on paper of their own determination, and then think ""I'm sure the bronies will enjoy this too"" after the fact (especially considering the target demographic *generally* isn't savvy or religiously dedicated enough to catch these references).",™

What are the other things listed:  * Violent crimes: Includes murder, neglient, and non-negligent manslaughter, robbery, and other violent crimes.  * Property: Includes burglary, fraud, and other property crimes.  * Public-order: Includes immigration, weapons, and other public-order offenses.  So let's take a look at these. At a federal level of jurisdiction and subsequent convictions, murders would include what exactly, serial killers?; armed bank robberies, and other acts of mass violence; bombings and threatening federal officials. All the nasty stuff that is not handled at the state level.  Fraud, oh boy, not a lot of those get heavy incarceration time do they?  Immigration, I dunno, by the looks of these numbers, I'm glad we're not locking people up on immigration crimes... In fact I bet this number is so large due to the other thing on that list, weapons, illegal arms trades, and the like.  Drugs are not Made in America™. We're just really great consumers.  The point being, out of all the things on that list, drugs are the easiest to be pushed up to the Feds, because they pass borders so easily; even between states would require some sort of Fed involvement.

t5_2t5iz,CassTheWary,1372479179,"I got a little carried away…  Greetings, fellow travelers. This is your great^500 grandfather speaking, and former captain of the N. H. Sepiida. If you are hearing this message, it means you have encountered a planet suitable for life. Why would you need a planet, you ask? You are safe and comfortable in the spacecraft in which your ancestors have resided in for thousands of years. But no progress can be made in a metal dome floating through the vast confines of space. What is progress, you ask? Progress is something that happened long, long ago, back on Earth.  You see, humanity hasn’t always inhabited a single-species, self-sustaining dome. Long ago, we once lived on a large, moist rock orbiting a star. We called the rock Earth, and our star was the Sun. All of our energy came from the Sun, but for the vast majority of our existence, we lacked the ability to harness its power directly for food. Instead, we depended on the variety of other creatures that we shared the planet with. Plants converted sunlight into food, and animals ate this food and produced new food. Every creature filled a unique role in the delicate balance of the Earth, and each depended upon the others for survival, as did we. That was, until we foolishly destroyed it, forcing the few survivors to flee with hopes of finding a new home.  And here you are. After thousands of years, you have made it. And now you must abandon the cozy home in which your ancestors have lived for thousands of years, to enter a perilous world full of suffering and death. So why shouldn’t you chose to remain in your garden of Eden rather than pick the fruit of knowledge, that nightmare orb of the unknown?  Because without the danger, there is no progress. I would assume that your population has remained a healthy constant, but the craft can only support a few hundred thousand humans. This may seem like a lot, but there were once billions of us. So many minds, working together, could do almost anything. With what, you ask? With the materials that the Earth provided for us, that we picked from the plants and dug from the ground and sliced from the animals. In the tiny, closed system of the Sepiida, you have no material to create with, and I would doubt that technology has improved significantly, if at all, over your journey. To remain in the craft would be to seal your doom. Although intended to last a millennia, its end is inevitable. A single meteor could obliterate the last remaining humans, occurring perhaps in a million years, perhaps tomorrow. To remain, would be to turn your womb into a casket.  This is where the cuttlefish comes in. Of all the creatures we destroyed, it was the most valuable. Too late did we discover its miraculous medical and psychological properties, as well as its ability to purify radioactive water. But most important were its intelligence and adaptability, traits you have no doubt long forgotten in your voyage. To survive again on a precarious rock, you must learn them from the cuttlefish.  Now, the cuttlefish became extinct following the nuclear disaster of 2306. Fortunately, you still have a chance to recreate it. Although the age of progress had disastrous consequences, the some of the ideas created were beneficial, even miraculous. For example, the Beastsculptor®. This device will create a living thing by reading brainwaves, and searching its archives for creatures that resemble your thoughts. But be warned, as the energy required will be taken from your ship’s navigation system, so it must land shortly after. Strap on a brain-reader, close your eyes, and start thinking real hard.  Let’s begin with something simple, something I can be sure hasn’t changed since I wrote this message so many generations ago. Think of water. I would suggest a floating drop of water, but if the your ship has been rotating properly, the force created would give you no concept of a lack of gravity. So instead, imagine an air bubble in water, smooth and gently undulating. It is large and oblong, the size of your hand. Its opaque texture is somewhere in between that of your skin and the metallic walls of your ship, its perimeter fringed by a fleshy lip. From one end sprout numerous finger-like appendages, fluid and elastic, surrounded on either side by dark, lidless eyes not unlike your own. These are the eyes of your teacher, your mentor, and your dinner.  The Beastsculptor® is searching its archives. Whether it will succeed I cannot tell you, but I hope that my power of description and yours of imagination have been sufficient. Soon, you will discover whether it is possible to imagine something solely from a few ancient words said centuries ago, and whether humanity will live once again, but my work is done. Best wishes for the future, and may the cuttlefish be with you. ",®

t5_2xm4b,SlightlyAmused,1372481369,"Have you read [this article](http://www.askdavetaylor.com/protect_unpublished_book_manuscript_seeking_publisher.html)? While the question is specifically asking about protecting work against publishers, a copywrite still applies to everyone across the board including test readers...   Under US law (and internationally, basically, since the US has copywrite relations with most countries) your work is under legal copywrite protection the moment you write those words down on paper. From the [US Copywrite Office website:](http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#mywork)  &gt;*Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.*   &gt;**Do I have to register with your office to be protected?**  &gt;*No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Copyright Registration.”*    So you are protected as is, but for extra peace of mind (and, perhaps, extra warning for the reader), feel free to put as many little ""© All Rights Reserved"" blurbs as you wish, perhaps at the bottom of every page, and you could even include page at the beginning of your manuscript stating the actual copywrite law, word for word, so as to ensure that the reader is clearly informed of said law.    Tis true that every now and again people get burned/taken advantage of, which results in a legal headache, but the odds of this happening are still slim overall. I suppose the only way to ensure this wouldn't happen would be to hand the manuscript over in person and keep guard over the reader until they finish reading it, but that might be overdoing it a bit. I say take the risk, stamp a few ©'s, and march onward toward your goal! You'll be a-okay. I hope this helps, and best of luck to you!",©

t5_2qh0n,Melchoir,1372497791,"Creating a proof involves two steps:  1. Understand the problem and its solution. 2. Write out the solution in a way that will convince other people of your understanding.  Brand-name tools like Pigeonhole Principle™, Prime Factorization™, and Induction™ are useful for step 2. However, they can get in your way if you try to apply them to step 1. Put them aside.  Here are some general problem-solving strategies I would try:  * *Poke the hard part of the problem with a stick.* Can you do anything with n^a - n^b that would make it look different? * *Brute-force small examples.* Solve the problem for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... Look for patterns. If you don't find a pattern, keep going. * *Practice on a simpler problem.* Replace the ""10"" in the problem with ""2"". Is this problem easier to solve? Can you adapt the solution to the original problem? What if you test for divisibility by 3?  Don't try to be clever. Just grind and be patient.  Of course, in elementary mathematics, you were encouraged to solve problems in a different way. You mastered a few powerful tools. Then you were given a large number of problems to solve in a short period of time. You would squint at each problem and try to guess the two or three tools that would solve it. Then you would duct-tape those tools into something like a solution, desperately hoping it would work, and if you ran out of tools, you gave up. That's not gonna fly anymore. If you approach a problem with the attitude ""How can I make tool X fit the problem"", sometimes it'll work fantastically, but sometimes it will lead you on a wild goose chase. (Which is fine if you remember to enjoy the chase.)  Someday, you will encapsulate your hard-won knowledge into a fancy schema with a brand name of its own, like ""modular arithmetic"". You may become so adept at applying the schema that you no longer notice that you're doing it at all, and so you flatter yourself, imagining that you've managed to merge steps 1 and 2 together. You may even convince yourself that you learned the schema by a straightforward process of absorbing definitions, lemmas, and theorems from a book. Resist these lies!",™

t5_2qh1i,903530986709239856,1372524515,"In almost everything we do, there are numbers involved - telephone numbers, credit card and ATM numbers, zip codes, passwords, calculations, and many others! Whether you love them or you hate them, numbers are here to stay. In order to cope up with today’s hectic lifestyle, you have to be able to remember a lot of numbers, or you’ll end up getting all confused and disorganized.  Contrary to words that can be associated with an object, numbers are difficult to remember because they are abstract. If I say think of a pen, your mind immediately visualizes the pen. But if I say 2473, you will have a hard time committing it to memory.  It's possible to be learn various memory techniques to remember numbers better so you can perform your usual transactions quicker and more efficiently.  Senses:  Your senses, particularly the ears and eyes, may prove to be effective in recalling numbers. Here’s how it works:  Repeat the number several times to yourself. It may be difficult for you to remember a number such as “2895” as an abstract thing, but easy for you to remember the sound of “twenty-eight ninety-five.”  You may also visualize the number. Write it down several times to lodge it to your memory bank. An even better idea is to create a vivid image of that number for better memory retention. Visualize “2895” beautifully laid out on a billboard in large sizes and luminous colors, with pieces of jewelry all around it. The number just follows you wherever you go. You see it everywhere. It’s on your bathroom mirror, on the TV screen, in the fireplace, it just won’t let you go! You can even intensify the image by making a jingle or slogan like “2895, I like you to jive!”  You may forget that the number of a certain house or office is 2895, but you may easily remember the sound of the spoken words ""two-eight-nine-five,"" or the form of ""2895"" as you see it on the door of the place.  Association:   The Law of Association may be used advantageously in memorizing numbers. For instance, one might remember the number 186,000 (the number of miles per second traveled by light-waves in the ether) by associating it with the number of his father's former place of business, ""186."" Another person may remember his zip code ""1876"" by recalling the date of the Declaration of Independence.  Converting Numbers to Words:  One very common yet practical technique to remember numbers is to transform them to words. Probably the easiest way to do this is to assign each number 1 to 9 a letter equivalent: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and so on. Using this technique, 742 turns into GDB. The letters GDB doesn’t make much sense, so you have to turn it into an acrostic. How about “Great Dancing Bellies?” The next time you want to recall 742, just recall “Great Dancing Bellies” and convert the first letters of each word back to their number equivalents. If you think the phrase “Great Dancing Bellies” may still slip your mind, create an image of fat tummies dancing merrily to the beat of the drum.  Here’s another example. If you need to remember your system password which is 135, then you may imagine your computer “Allowing Cute Entrance” to someone as adorable as you. ☺  The Picture Code:   Using this technique, you assign an image to each number 1 to 9 that is similar to its appearance. See how the numbers below look like the objects they are representing:  0 = ball  1 = magic wand  2 = swan  3 = fork    4 = sailboat  5 = seahorse  6 = bomb    7 = crowbar  8 = hourglass  9 = balloon   Memorize all the symbols above and their number equivalents. If you find that these symbols do not stick in your mind, then convert them to something that you can remember better. After memorizing the images, you can begin using this method.  Let’s say you want to remember the street number of your friend’s home, which is 289. You can then visualize a swan (2) swimming with an hourglass (8) at it’s back; and tied to the hourglass is a big red balloon (9). Or let’s say you want to remember 471. You can imagine a sailboat (4) with a crowbar (7) hanging at its side; and glued to the crowbar is a long wand (1).  The Major Memory System:   This method is a bit complicated and detailed; but once you get the hang of it, you can remember long strings of numbers and you can even impress your friends! In this method, each number is assigned a consonant or a consonant sound based on the following:  0 = s, z, soft-c (“z” is first letter of zero)  1 = t ( “t” is similar to a 1 with a line through it)   2 = n (“n” has two bars)   3 = m (“m” has three bars)   4 = r (“r” is last letter of four)   5 = L (“L” is Roman numeral for 50)  6 = j, sh, ch, soft-g (“g” is 6 rotated 180 degrees)  7 = k (“k” looks like two 7s rotated and pasted together)  8 = f, v (“f” written in cursive has two loops similar to 8)  9 = p, b (“p” and “b” looks like 9 in different angles)    Here’s how this system works. Get the consonant or consonant sounds of the numbers, and add vowels between them to form a group of words, phrase, or sentence.  Let’s say the phone number you want to remember is 854-0341. Convert that to “flr-smrt.” Add some vowels and you will come up with something like “flower smart.” The next time you need to access that phone number, just remember “flower smart.” You can even add a dash of visualization and humor by imagining a flower with thick glasses and a diploma, reading “Theory of Relativity.”  ",☺

A state is a tool which is used by one class to oppress another. During a socialist revolution, the proletariat casts down the bourgeoisie but the class struggle continues with the workers using the state to oppress the bourgeoisie. It's not a hard concept to grasp.    You cannot run a country like an anarchist village, I believe history has proven that often enough.

Anyhow, my match this Sunday will be a great opportunity for me to remind everybody again why exactly I am the RWF champion. I mean, I've beaten the likes of HvX and bullied both Lee Mercer and Alex Amazing out of this company, so beating Mikko probably won't be such a big problem.

t5_2rww2,Generic_name13,1372548209,"So this was my accidental haul.  -OPI by sephora: 50% of sale! Could not pass up. The formula is amazing, full coverage, &amp; chip resistant. I, also, purchased a 3 in 1 base, top coat, &amp; nail strengthener. This makes your nail hard as a rock. You will break a nail before you chip your polish.  -I've always wanted to try Ciatè polish, because I'm a sucker for cute packaging. 8/10. I had to use 3 coats for full coverage. But not a chip in days.  -NARS Train Bleu- WOW!!!! Do I need to elaborate? This lip pencil lives up to the hype. The texture, pigmentation, &amp; longevity is AWESOME!!!! Where was this lip pencil during my 90s grunge phase? Where I ask? I love it &amp; it's not drying. Win win.  - Peter Thomas Roth firmX exfoliating lotion. Ok, 1 yes, there is a gimmick aspect to this product. It claims you apply &amp; it you can see the dead skin rub off. Well, I don't think it's dead skin that pills up, but the cellulose in it, BUT, DAMYUM if my face did not look amazing after. BECCA's skin perfector perfectly ruined my skin &amp; left dry, bumpy, patches on the areas I had apply it. I was afraid my face was ruined, but FirmX, after 1 application, completely resurfaced my face without irritation or abrasive techniques. My face was smooth, glowing, silky, &amp; the bumps are near gone. Also, minimized my pores.  MURAD pore, fine line, minimizer with oil absorption is my HG morning moisturizer. This leaves a silky smooth base for primer/ foundation. Controls oil all day long.  MUFE green corrector primer: FAIL- being returned ASAP. This ish does not correct redness, absorb oil, nor minimizes pores. It was thick green slime that stayed on my skin that I couldn't rub in. HORRIBLE. MUFE advertises this as an answer to redness, but you would need the whole bottle of slime to cover the slightest blush.  -Anastasia Brow genius is GENIUS!!! Unfortunately I chose brunette. I'm a Hispanic/ Caribbean girl, with medium complexion, dark brown hair, &amp; black brows. The color ""brunette"" is waaaaaaay too dark for me. It made look like a chola. The lighter brown is perfect!!! The whole process of making the brow filler could be tedious for some, but I love the ritual/ prep of it all.    -MUFE eyeshadow in matte red. I've been searching for a) a red eyeshadow B) a red eyeshadow with pigment (I've bought NYX, Shiro, OCC, but they all lacked what I was looking for 😢). MUFE delivered everything i wanted with this eyeshadow. True to color, great pigmentation, extremely blendable &amp; crease proof. I do wish it was more blue-red.   - Sephora airbrush concealer brush #57. I fell in love with this brush when I got my makeup done at Sephora. The MUA said it was   -samples!!!! Lots and lots of samples!!! I even got their Sweet 15 tote, which is, totes cute!  Update: returned the products I didn't like &amp; purchased the Lorac Pro Palette. I'm a happy mamma",😢

t5_2qhjz,frenchyshadow,1372549712,"Hi,  (FYI, I'm French)  1 - I don't live in Nîmes, nor I know the city. But I have lived in multiple French cities in the “*province*” (outside Paris). I was staying suburb of those cities (because I'm cheap). And bad suburbs there aren't nearly as bad as the ones in Paris. But I think it's different because I'm a guy and I can act like I from the neighborhood.  So I was going to say: “it doesn't really matter where you stay”, but I guess since you're a foreign young woman, it might be relevent to ask. You can usually spot bad neighborhood if it looks [like that](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/17460051.jpg). But we have housing project like the ones in the US (beautiful individual houses in the suburbs) but this is for poor people as well. Anyway, keep in mind that Europe is backward: bad neighborhood = suburbs, good neighborhood = downtown.  3 - I'm living in the US right now, and I can tell you it is crazy easy to get around in French cities without a car (compared to the US.) If you stay one year or more, and you don't want to invest in Car, I would recommend you to get a bicycle. If you do want to invest in a Car, be careful, most cars have stick you might will have to buy driving lessons and your US driver license might not be exchangeable with a European one.  4 - If you like good food. Welcome in southern France! I don't live here, but every time I go see some friend they have amazing Farmer's market. Go there: more fresh, sometimes cheaper, better ratio quality-freshness/price. Don't buy from people with a huge stands those are just scammers, buy from local producers only selling 3 or 4 different products. I'm amazed by how easy it is to eat vegan/vegetarian in the US. If you're vegetarian/vegan, you will have a hard time finding food/restaurants in France.  If you wanna buy furniture, it depends how long you stay. If don't stay long (less than 2 years) buy from ikea, it can be very cheap. But you will need a car because the closest is in Montpelier. One other way would be to buy furniture in “brocantes” (local sell outs).  In the US you have fees for everything. Most banks in France just have flat fees, that's all. I pay something like 23 € per year for a Visa and a checkbook: the checkbook are free, they send me a new one when I used one, I can use any ATM from any bank anywhere in Europe without any fee. It's very cheap because I'm under 26, after that I think it's 50 €, but you can qualify for this kind of account since your 22. I chose my bank because my banker is a friend from middle school, so any time I have a problem with my account I directly call her. So I can't give you the best advice. I know in the US the best is to go in a Local Bank or a Credit Union in order to have fewer fees. It's not the case in France, I would go to a large bank, because they can afford to be cheap since they have a lot of customers:    * Crédit Agricole (biggest bank group in Europe), they have a lot of branch everywhere in France. Their branch network across is huge.  * Caisse d'épargne (partly owned by the french government)  * Banque Postale (owned by the French government, they don't gamble any money in sock exchange)  * CIC (they are supposed to be very cheap according to their commercials. But they might have silly fees like US bank, I'm not sure)  &gt; Hmm, c'est tout ce que je peux penser. Aussi, pardonnez-moi mon mauvais français, et soyez libre de me corriger si vous l'aimeriez!  That's all right. I speak broken English too. Since you asked: “C'est tout ce que j'ai en tête. Et excusez mon mauvais français, n'hésitez pas à me corriger si vous voulez!”  Just two or three thing that I realize while speaking English didn't translate well :  * feel free ↔ n'hésitez pas * if you like ↔ si tu veux * all I can think of ≃ ce que j'ai en tête",↔

t5_2tz1e,Townsley,1372573198,"&gt;You can't possibly believe that generalizing both criminals and normal people into one group because they both are connected by firearms is logical.  You were the one saying that guns don't kill people, gun owners kill people.  Now that you are stuck with that argument, you don't like it?    When you say gun owners kill people it is very illogical to ignore the set of Americans who own guns and not further divide them into those gun owners who then commit crimes with them and those who don't.  &gt;I find it incredibly hard to believe that a rational and sane person who owns a gun could just snap out of abslutely nowhere.  Essentially, your arguments in this thread all boil down to a No True Scotsman.  You are trying to say No True Gun Owner® hurts anyone, they must be criminals or mentally insane.  When I show you that 4.5 million people have been shot by gun owners and 1.35 million killed in the last 45 years, you keep insisting that those are Not True Gun Owners®.  When I show you that gun owners consist of a class of people that are criminals, non-criminals, and insane, you keep trying to restrict the class of gun owners to people that don't commit crime.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman  Here was your original argument:  &gt;I'm not concerned about gun owner violence because most gun owners aren't violent.  Now that I see how you define ""gun owner"", I'm not surprised you think that would be the case.  But the 300 people shot by gun owners in the United States today prove otherwise.",®

t5_2qh1i,hallgrimg,1372601582,"How To Fly © by Douglas Adams  There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] suggests, and try it.    The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt.    That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.    Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.    One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.    It is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.    If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinty, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.    This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all consideration of your own weight simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of ""Good God, you can't possibly be flying!"" It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.    Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.    DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.    When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly easier and easier to achieve.    You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway.    You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.    There are private clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.",©

t5_2qh03,amorpheus,1372616642,"&gt; Looting makes no sense.  This is the one legitimate criticism I see here. But I see it as one of many little details that games have yet to evolve past; there is no game that doesn't do anything *gamey*, and if it boils down to minutiae such as this, I don't really care. Besides, did you ever think about it and realized that you don't have to loot anything? All the game really offers you is the *option* of Looting Stuff™, if you do it despite thinking it doesn't makes sense, don't bitch about it when the game fails to give you consequences such as people being bothered by it. (And on some occasions it actually does do that!)  &gt; Vigours make no sense, too.  They're new.  &gt; The rails are also nonsense.  But they're fun.

Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). In other words, they give birth to offspring. Last time I checked trans women don't naturally have this capability. Therefore they are not women, then are men.   You have no argument and it is clear you fail to realize that.  ""Your attempt to invalidate the gender of trans women is unethical because you are ignoring the facts"" It is pretty obvious that the only one ignoring facts here is you.  ""You seem to think that you have some right to engage in casual sex"" Other than in extreme religious nations, I pretty positive that in civilized places there are no laws against casual sex.  ""As I said elsewhere, if this is such a concern for you, then you should inform all your potential sex partners of your concern since you are the one in the wrong here.""  Why would it be the responsibility of the majority to accommodate to the minority? Logic fail.  You made the choice to change your body, so step up and take responsibility for your choice.",♀

t5_2r71o,snusenice,1372633033,"You wont be needing much graphics programming knowledge for this. It's basically to learn the basic parts of app dev on WP, accelerometer,GPS and camera parts of the SDK. Learn c#, that language is the language that .net framework is based around and will be the simplest to handle for that purpose. I recommended to get a good book on the c# language, to learn the basics and object oriented programming since everything is based around that.Note, I am not a WP developer or c# programmer, I have started reading it but lost motivation. I have programmed in the past tho. The most important tip I think is that you grasp the basics, make sure you really understand what different things are, how to use them, when and when/how not to use them. Try experimenting with sample code and see what it does, type all examples and don't rush it. The tools u need is win8 an visual studio 2012 (there's a express edition free). Don't be afraid too post this in wpdev, I think they can give you good pointers and you got nothing to loose.Oh also, take it slow...
