t5_2qont,Diblums,1372639279,"Thank you SO much for taking the time to ask, and then to realize that your life at present is not compatible with the life of a domestic fox. It's heartwarming to me to hear this. I have met far too many people who are not mature enough to come to this conclusion, and the results are heartbreaking.   I'm sure that if you wanted to, you could make it a future goal to have a fox as a pet, which gives you the time to ensure you have all of the things you and your future fox companion would need in place before you got one. Also look into local and regional laws regarding exotic pets and associated permits.   I feel strongly about this as I breed alpacas, and the number of fellow breeders that I know around here who sell their alpacas to whoever can show up with the sale price in hand is phenomenal. I go to great lengths to ensure that anyone who is interested in purchasing one of our alpacas as their first alpaca is going to have all of the needs of the animal available and ready before the alpaca sets foot on their property. I really believe any responsible breeder of any animal would ensure that their buyers are prepared for the responsibilities that come with the animals they breed.  Sorry for my mini rant, I was just very concerned reading your question, but your response to the answer blew me away. Thank you for thinking of the animals! ‚ô•",‚ô•

Tell TrueCookPlus your zip code so TrueCookPlus knows your elevation above sea level. Here's how... Press the TrueCookPlus button three times. Key in your five digit zip code. Press the start key.  &gt;Q: Why is TrueCookPlus revolutionary? A: TrueCookPlus does the thinking for you. You can forget about vague microwave directions, adding one more minute, and poking your finger in to see if its hot.  &gt;Q: I understand that TrueCookPlus eliminates concerns about e coli and salmonella. Is this true? A: Yes. TrueCookPlus cooks food to USDA microwave cooking target temperatures, eliminating concerns about e coli and salmonella. Always use a thermometer to confirm that your food has cooked to the temperature indicated on the food package.  &gt;Q: What can a microwave with TrueCookPlus do that old-style microwave ovens can't?

Beyond that, you can't even read the first paragraph of that explanation, so I'm going to copy it here so you can, maybe for the first time, see it:  &gt;This slide describes what happens when an NSA analyst ""tasks"" the PRISM system for information about a new surveillance target. The request to add a new target is passed automatically to a supervisor who reviews the ""selectors,"" or search terms. The supervisor must endorse the analyst's ""reasonable belief,"" defined as 51 percent confidence, that **the specified target is a foreign national who is overseas at the time of collection.**  [emphasis mine] Well how 'bout them shits.  What, again, are we talking about?  Something about spying on Americans?  It's almost like maybe they give a shit about your rights.  Maybe that confidence interval is a little shaky, but I'm going to have to bet that the number of 51%ers on that list is really, really small.  &gt;Actually something is being done. It is being collected.  Some data is, in the course of investigation, collected.  But apparently every person on reddit thinks that there's some way for the NSA to collect *all* of the data and just keep it.  Like, every phone call, photo, text message, video and email that has ever existed or will ever exist, is being kept on a server somewhere waiting for the time when the American Gestapo‚Ñ¢ is going to come ask you about your political activities by way of breaking your knees.  This is patently ridiculous for several reasons.  First, the volume of data that would have to be stored in that collection is so overwhelmingly vast as to be impossible to store in one location.  In fact, it gets more and more vast every second of every day.  Second, the manpower that would be required to even accomplish something like that, even with algorithmic computing, would be so staggeringly large that it would comprise a country in its own right.  &gt;B)Just because signal intelligence is useful doesn't mean it shouldn't be regulated.  Already regulated.  I don't know how many times I have to say this.  We have an entity for that.  It's called FISA.  No one wants to trust FISA because, by nature of its case load, it's not transparent.  As if intelligence ever could be transparent... but that lack of trust is just an argument from ignorance: I don't know what goes on there so it must be bad and wrong.  That's actually what this whole hullabaloo about the NSA is about.  Argument from ignorance.  ""I don't know anything about this so its scary kill it now.""  All evidenced by this:  &gt;Think about it they collect 10 years of data on you. You think to yourself doesn't matter they can't look at it with out a warrant. One day you get a parking ticket and forget to pay it. Now their is a bench warrant for your arrest for an unpaid parking ticket. They now can get a warrant to look through the 10 years of data to ""enable them"" find you in regards to the bench warrant they have for you.  Snowden reportedly didn't get on a plane to Cuba (that *bastion* of freedom) because he thought that the U.S. would shoot down a passenger plane with F22s right there in front of the world.  Like your little scenario here, it's something out of a Jason Bourne movie.  I can't say I'm surprised that people think movies are real life given how much people are exposed to them from an early age now.  I would like to say, though, that existence (history/human interaction) is almost always completely mundane and boring.  This is something you'll learn (I hope) as time goes on in your life.  Rarely is the conspiracy real, and even when it is, the conspiracy in itself is way more mundane than the movies make it out to be.  One of the fun ones is the whole Knights Templar bit.  Complete bollocks, the conspiracy theory, but certainly entertaining and grabs the minds of millions.  But, no, the local police aren't going to be looking at your 10 years of metadata because of a parking ticket.  There's no evidence that this has occurred or any reason to think that it will occur... but even if by some crazy, nigh impossible, happenstance it *does* occur somewhere, I can almost guarantee you that it will be an isolated case, not supported by the courts and shut down when it is exposed.  Yay for freedom.  The system isn't perfect, but it seems to work pretty often.  &gt;At least I actually have an argument and have been using facts, data and laws to back it up. Your whole ""argument"" so far is to try and attack me rather than actually debate.  There is nothing to debate here.  You have made no points except that we need an ECPA for metadata, but you have been unable to demonstrate *why* we need to do this because there is no evidence that there is a problem.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2ss5b,slapchopsuey,1372704938,"Yep.   I was a mod for /r/politics from August or September of 2011 until leaving in May of this year, and holy shit does that place grind mods up. It's been hemorrhaging great/competent/ truly fair-minded mods for months (and one or more not-so-great/competent/fair-minded mods as well), and I fully expect that trend to continue.   Since I quit that place, I reduced the subreddits I mod down to just a few small and medium sized ones with better subscribers, and the experience is SO much better and more worthwhile. It reminded me of how and why I got into modding in the first place. But thinking back to most of my time in /politics... it was a fool's errand.   See, many of the giant/controversial/default subreddits don't just pick up mods out of nowhere, they tend to pick them from people who have an established reputation and demonstrated experience modding other subreddits. The result of this is having a set of people who know their stuff... yet there are limits to that (see next paragraph).   Modding small to medium sized subreddits brings a series of changes and challenges as they grow, and it's rewarding to help manage a subreddit one cares about, both to see it thrive as well as the personal sense of being like the guy at the circus spinning all the plates on tall sticks.  But as a subreddit grows, there are more plates to spin, bigger plates to spin, and failure gets more epic and harder to manage the bigger it gets (making people more averse to failure as the place gets bigger, which just means problems grow and multiply).   Add to that, with truly idiotic and petulant people as the continually loudest subscribers, it does wear people down. But it's insidiously hard to notice, as  people who become mods there have thick skins to begin with, and delude themselves/ourselves into thinking just because nothing got under our skin so far, and because no individual or specific incident got under our skin so far, that the cumulative sum of everything cannot break our backs. It's this last part that is what repeatedly burns people out. The weight of it all, the constant daily grind of nasty, petulant morons, it wears people out.   --------------  But what are the upsides? What keeps people there? (Check one or more boxes):  **üëì Collectors:** It's a mark of personal self-worth and accomplishment to mod a *lot* of subreddits.   **üëì Easy Street Emerituses:** The top few mods of many subreddits shift to a hibernating state, where they come out of the woodwork only when there are problems caused by mods further down the list. All the grief and negativity from dealing with the subscriber base, they don't have to deal with that. It's easy... for them. This group happens to overlap heavily with the Collectors, no surprise there.   **üëì POWER:** Of these, some are easy to spot (they never get brought on as mods in large subreddits to begin with), but others are more clever. The clever ones only gradually become known as problem-makers after they're entrenched, and they greatly benefit from the environment of a continually hostile userbase that forces mods together. It's hard to deal with a problem on the inside when constantly under siege from the outside. Add to it how there really isn't a good way to remove clever bad mods (having a higher-ranking mod just simply remove them never seems to happen), and  POWER is fulfilling and rewarding benefit of being a mod of a giant/controversial sub to the handful of mods who get their rocks off on it, continuing to attract such people like a bug zapper that doesn't zap.   **üëì Pretend Job:** The constant daily grind resembles a work day, and the most active hours happen to sync up with the average American workday. There's something about modding a large sub that lures mods into thinking of it like a job. (I and most mods fall in this category). It's a good way to keep customer service skills fresh, for un/underemployed people to keep in the habit of working, and for IT people with cushy jobs to pretend to work instead of actually working. Note that people with real jobs don't fall for this. Only once mods fully embrace that they're not getting compensated in any way for contributing real work to what they thought was going to be a fun recreational activity does the bubble get popped.   **üëì Smarty-pants ego-building:** (I and some mods fall in this category) *""So there's this big subreddit with unsolved problems and they desperately need more mods?* **I** *can do it! I've managed small and medium subreddits pretty well, so obviously I could do this too. I'll get in there, apply my brilliant mind to solving the problems that no one else figured out so far, and everything will be great!""* Of course, problems that one expects should be solved in a week turns into a month, turns into many months, and it never seems to really get much better. Sure, there is small improvement, and like hungry dogs we savor and devour every bit of that, using it as justification for all our effort so far and the crumbs of victory motivate us to do more of the same in the future. But eventually there's a moment when a mod takes a step back and has to recognize *""we didn't fix shit""*. That's the reality-check that every smarty-pants needs.   There might be more, but you get the idea.   tl;dr - What are the upsides of modding a large/controversial subreddit? See the bold font beside the little boxes.   EDIT: fixed smarty-pants paragraph",üëì

t5_2cneq,Ipuvaepe,1372707691,"The failure of single method for solving a problem does not prove the problem insolvable.  The likely problem in this scenario is the method for processing, or more accurately the lack of processing power (people) to perform the outlined functions.  This does not affect the legitimacy of a law.  I would also point out that you opened the door to criticism of your job.  I'm not going to because I'm not an asshole, but I will have to insist that your (probably, but not definitely, accurate) interpretation of a workload invalidating a law is flawed at best.  I don't slightly doubt your statement, but it is not proven fact and cannot be used as such.  ‚Ä¢ proposal x  ‚ô¶ proposal x would too heavily increase the already maxed workload  Since the accuracy of any statement is perpetually in question, this rather blatantly opens the door to examination of the components of the statement in question, or the workload.  **tl;dr I'm not here to poke holes in anyone's job despite you having opened the door to it.**  **The factual accuracy of a statement must be examined before evaluation.

This whole comment thread started because I pointed out that a lot of CoH vets are disappointed with changes made to CoH 2. Many CoH vets hate defensive play. This is why we hated the Brits in OF, and any trends towards that shit in CoH 2 is stuff we dislike. You don't have to agree. I'm just stating what a lot of people believe.  If you're using 2v2s for examples then that's great that you enjoy that kind of game but what I'm talking about is competitive 1v1 when I speak for what CoH vets dislike about the changes. RTS games are often divided into various groups of players - single player only people, compstompers, team game players, and more competitive 1v1 players. Some people straddle the groups, others mostly hang out in one group. When I'm speaking of CoH vets I'm talking about the 1v1 people - anyone who enjoyed 2v2 and up in CoH is probably going to like CoH 2 about as much because team games always have been and always will be clusterfucks.  The ""bug"" with shooting through mountains likelyisn't a bug and likely is not going to be fixed. Elevation has nothing to do with TrueSight‚Ñ¢ right now and it probably never will.

Probably as much control as you want.  &gt;In the 401k I have elected to invest in large cap growth/mid cap growth/small cap core and company stock fund blend - approximately even distribution. What do you think of this?   Are you getting the company stock at a discount?  Having company stock in a retirement fund is not a good idea in my opinion.

It's the basic stuff that you probably know that's key:  Eat less, move more.  I was surprised to find out that the recommended portions of some foods were so small.  Weight out 30g of cereal and see how small it is!  I don't eat cereal now but have crumpets with low fat margarine and some fruit for breakfast and it fills me up for hours.  If you're an omnivore, eat mainly lean meat - chicken, lean beef, turkey (even kangaroo meat is a good lean choice!) and try and eat dairy but not MASSES of cheese/butter, look more towards lower fat cheeses, eggs, skimmed milk.  I hate exercise, in fact I haven't been to the gym in months, but I bought a pedometer and use it to track how much I'm moving.  I don't often hit 10000 steps a day, but I try and aim for at least 6000 and anything else is a bonus.  Good luck with it and if there's anything you need feel free to PM me ‚ô•",‚ô•

In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete.     **‚ÄúWill we ever see some GTA V gameplay?‚Äù  ‚Äì @ASTR4Lx**   Yes.

I mean will GTAV have many discs (on Xbox 360 platform)‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äì youtubos ‚ÄúIf we install GTAV on Xbox 360 do we have to insert other discs or not?‚Äù ‚Äì Persian-boy1995  **Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game we have yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles. In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete.**   ‚ÄúWill we ever see some GTA V gameplay?‚Äù  ‚Äì @ASTR4Lx  **Yes. Soon (or in September if you don‚Äôt want to see it before you play it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs up to you) ‚Äì the first Official Gameplay Video is on its way...**  ‚ÄúHey Rockstar, I'm curious whether you are planning on releasing GTA V on the PC...‚Äù ‚Äì received via Mouthoff ‚ÄúYou've probably been asked before, but is GTA V coming for next gen consoles also?‚Äù ‚Äì @tomtoon2010  **The only versions of the game that we have announced are for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 which are set for a September 17th worldwide release. We don‚Äôt have anything to share about the possibility of a next-gen or a PC platform release at this time and we are completely focused on delivering the best possible experience for the consoles people have right now.**  ‚ÄúWhen will we get information on GTA V multiplayer?‚Äù ‚Äì @camronbnl3  **Expect to hear some first details soon ‚Äì it‚Äôs called Grand Theft Auto Online and we‚Äôre very excited to unveil it for you sometime this summer.**  ‚ÄúA healthy GTAIV multiplayer game is really hard to come by nowadays. By healthy I mean players play for good clean fun. Every time I join a game it's either modded or hacked. When I create a custom game, some abusive d*ck joins my game and ruins everyone's fun game. I can't just kick him out unless everyone votes. Do something about this in GTAV, Rockstar.‚Äù ‚Äì received via Mouthoff  **Ever since Grand Theft Auto IV was released, we‚Äôve continued to integrate newer and stronger methods of cheat detection and prevention for each of our games. While we have yet to reveal specifically what new anti-cheating measures we have planned for GTAV, rest assured that we‚Äôre focused on creating as level a playing field and as fair, fun (and healthy as you say) an experience as possible for everyone. There will always be some people who want to cheat but we are going to do our best to stop it. We have spent a lot of time and effort making an incredible Online experience and proper support is part of that package.**   ‚ÄúHello Rockstar, I have a question: how much difference will there be between the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game?‚Äù ‚Äì received via Mouthoff  **Players can expect the same great gameplay experience on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as they have both been developed in tandem.  Like all of our games, trust that we‚Äôre committed to making sure Grand Theft Auto V looks and runs as great as possible regardless of whether you pick it up for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, and we are excited for fans on both platforms to experience Grand Theft Auto V this September. We expect any visual differences to be completely negligible.**  ‚ÄúI smell a delay...‚Äù ‚Äì SanViceCity ‚ÄúHope R* will release this game on September 17th. HOPE it will no be delayed AGAIN.‚Äù ‚Äì creed_20103  **There‚Äôs nothing to worry about, so we aren‚Äôt quite sure what you‚Äôre smelling!  GTAV will be available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 17th.**",¬Æ

There are certain (payment required) programs like 'UneditReddit' that cache comments, and show them whenever they are deleted, so some people can still see them. I guess, because this program isn't free of use and directly benefits from Reddit, Reddit¬© itself tries to thwart their efforts to monetize something that is their copyright (i.e. our comments) by blacking them out. I don't use the program, but in RES it sometimes pops up whenever a comment is deleted. If someone deletes their comment, it means that either that A) it is downvoted too much, and the original poster tries to save some face or B) the original poster for some reason is ashamed/doesn't want to have this comment link back to his account (i.e. drunk, high, broke some rules (like NDA's, personal information, etc)).

Although you cannot pick your biological family, you can certainly build your own family/community and it seems that you have. In this life, we have the freedom to choose who to surround ourselves with, and you shouldn't feel like you have to be with those who only put you down. Your friends and significant other and their families *can* be your family too. I see nothing wrong or all that weird about it.   I'm not sure exactly what you're searching for here, though it seems like you are questioning your relationship with your boyfriend because he isn't a Christian?   If he is a good person, does it matter that he doesn't believe in god? If it really does, and you resent him or wish he was different,  perhaps he isn't the right one for you.

I dunno, to me that view of ""sovereignty"" makes God out to be a seriously petty asshole, a sadistic schoolyard bully who likes to play mind games with weaker kids before beating them up. To say nothing of the disturbing nationalist overtones of some of those churches (though to be fair, some of the slightly more tame evangelical churches I've gone to seem more apt to see the elusive ""church"" in that role of holding back God's judgment).   And even trying to think back within my old Baptist fundie mindset, I don't really get it.

I know you don't like blogs, but there are summaries compiled from amazon reviews of each of the books found in Michael Jackson's house that were submitted as ""evidence"". They all seem to photography books, studying sexuality in general. Photos of nude men and women of course are contained within the books. The books containing children are not sexual in nature, and if they were, you could bet your last dollar he would have been convicted of possesion.   http://vindicatemj.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/porn-found-in-michael-jacksons-home-2/  **It is significant to mention that the mere possession of child pornography is a federal crime. Many states also have criminal statutes for the possession and distribution of child pornography. If the books had been pornographic in nature or substance, prosecution would have been inevitable.**  Now, regarding child pornography. None was found in michael Jackson's home/s, hard drives, or any of his computers. **HAD CHILD PORNOGRAPHY BEEN FOUND IN MICHAEL JACKSON's POSSESION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR POSSESION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.**  **I repeat it is illegal to be in the possesion of child erotica**  When did I repeat any lines that the ""Jackson camp"" puts out? I quoted directly from court transcripts. I provided you audio evidence of the taped phone conversation. There are links to FBI files posted on this page. You are either delusional or incredibly stupid.  There are plenty of people who aren't michael jackson fans who believe and support his innocence.

You failed to provide any coherent argument, have not proven a single one of your claims, and haven't responded to all the evidence i provided you. Why? Because you have NOTHING TO ARGUE. I asked you many questions in my posts and you haven't answered any. You avoid questions you don't have an answer to, and move on to another topic. When that gets discredited, you move on to another one. Everyone here can see through your pathetic attempt to pin something, anything, on mj to make him seem even a little guilty.

The difference is that it focuses more on adventuring (something that I found lacking in Minecraft).   The alpha cost appears to be ‚Ç¨15/$20.10, and I believe it has been said that the final price will be about $40. Updates will be free (at least until release), and there's a fair bit of content still planned. Multiplayer is also working in the alpha, for those interested.  [Here's a link to the developer's blog](http://wollay.blogspot.ie/), and a [preview video from November of last year](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhyP9kc7OCY).

t5_2r8c5,Curbob,1372795937,"I received the same message, no idea what it was for. I wonder if it has to do with the new AT&amp;T privacy Policy (I received this email today)    Dear Valued Customer,   We know your privacy is important, so we've made it a priority to talk to you about it. We're revising our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand, and we want to point out two new programs that could help us and other businesses serve you better.   The first program will make reports available to businesses. These reports will contain anonymous information about groups of customers, such as how they collectively use our products and services. The second program will use local geography as a factor in delivering online and mobile ads to the people who might find them most useful.   As always, we follow important principles to keep your trust: We are committed to protecting your privacy. We provide you with privacy choices. We will not sell information that identifies you to anyone, for any purpose. Period. We are committed to listening and keeping you informed about how we protect your privacy. The two new programs are described in this notice, including your privacy choices for each. You can also read the new and old versions of our privacy policy at att.com/privacy.   To provide feedback on the new policy, please write us in the next 30 days at privacyfeedback@att.com or AT&amp;T Privacy Policy, 1120 20th Street NW, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20036.   Sincerely,   Robert W. Quinn Jr. AT&amp;T Senior Vice President - Federal Regulatory &amp; Chief Privacy Officer   P.S.: Please note that if you have multiple accounts, we thank you, and we want to let you know you may receive more than one copy of this notice.  How do we use information?  Information is collected whenever you use our products and services. From this information, we can do things like enhance the network, address problems and manage your services.  Here are details about two new programs, including privacy choices that you can make now and change any time you like.  Program One: ""External Marketing &amp; Analytics Reports""  We will make reports available to businesses to help them serve their customers better. These reports will contain anonymous information about our customers, such as how they use our products and services. The identity of individual customers is removed, and the information is used in a group, or aggregate, format.  For example, we might provide reports to retailers about the number of wireless devices in or near their store locations by time of day and day of week, together with the device users' collective information like ages and gender. This might allow a retailer in your neighborhood to learn more about local consumers as a group, but not about anyone individually, to improve its service.  You can choose to have your anonymous information excluded from these reports - things like wireless location information, U-verse¬Æ information, and website browsing or mobile application usage. Please visit att.com/cmpchoice, or call 1.866.344.9850.   Program Two: Relevant Advertising including ""Wireless Location Characteristics""   Relevant advertising from AT&amp;T uses information from a variety of sources to help deliver online and mobile ads that you might find useful. We're currently creating a new ""wireless location characteristic"" that will help us use local geography as a factor in delivering ads. This doesn't mean you'll get more ads. It means that the ads that you do get from AT&amp;T may be more suited to your interests.  Location characteristics are types of locations - like ""movie theaters."" People who live in a particular geographic area might appear to be very interested in movies, thanks to collective information that shows wireless devices from that area are often located in the vicinity of movie theaters. We might create a ""movies"" characteristic for that area, and deliver movie ads to the people who live there.   Personal information is not shared with advertisers, but if you don't want to receive this type of ad from us, you have that choice. You will still receive the same number of ads. They just might not be as relevant to you. Simply go to adworks.att.com/adpreferences on your computer or adworks.att.com/mobileoptout on your wireless device. You must opt-out from each computer browser or wireless device that you wish to exclude.",¬Æ

Irish moss (last 30 minutes of the boil)   * White Labs WLP 001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast     * 0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)     Step by Step  Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 153 ¬∫F (67 ¬∫C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).         Cool the wort to 75 ¬∫F (24 ¬∫C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ¬∫F (20 ¬∫C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the Centennial and Cascade dry hops. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks and enjoy your O‚ÄôDark:30.    **Came out very delicious and drinkable. Smooth and malty but with some nice hops flavor from the dry hopping. Will definitely make this one again.**  edit: formatting ",¬Æ

t5_2r65t,BScott13,1372817652,"1. J.Crew, Banana Republic, Gap, or Brooks Brothers. Even if they are a little more expensive than you wanted to spend, if you stick to classic fits and styles they will out wear the initial expense.   2. Button-ups, shirts without buttons on the collar, are typically more formal. The most common collar for these types of shirts would be a Medium-Spread or Ainsley collar. A contrasting collar is also usually considered more formal on button-up shirts. Really dressy ones will have a detachable collar. Most dress shirts will also require cuff links. Typically they will not have a breast pocket on the front of the shirt. Broadcloth would be the most common weave for more formal shirts, Poplin is also usually a safe bet for dress shirts. I would almost always stick with cotton in formal setting also. Dress shirts are mostly solid colors, sometimes you can get away with a basic stripe pattern though depending on the occasion.  The button-down, shirts with buttons on the collar, are more casual. They will usually have breast pockets and never require cuff links. You can get them in any kind of weave that you want, a Plain Oxford is most common. You can choose whatever you want though, they are often in a range of plaids and stripes. Since they are casual shirts, you also have much more freedom with the fabrication. Basic cotton is a classic, but in the summer months you may also consider Linen, Madras, Seersucker, Chambray, or even Hemp if you so desired. All of these, except Cotton, are seasonal fabrics for the summer months. In winter you can do Flannel, Corduroy, and different kinds of wool blends.  I don't know if you want to worry too much about the thickness of the fabric or the length of the shirt to decide if it is formal or not. The season will affect the weight of the fabric. With today's technology a lot of casual button-downs are made quite light-weight, especially for the summer. And often the cotton is combed and brushed so you could find ones just as smooth as dress shirts. As far as length goes, I would stick to ones that are the proper length to be tucked in. That way you at least always have the option. Shorter ones seem very immature and maybe even a bit sloppy, but that's just my personal opinion.  3. Patterns and designs are kind of difficult to suggest without knowing your style and taste but I'd give you some basic suggestions that I would try.

t5_2qstm,aBoglehead,1372820119,"401ks are tax-deferred investment accounts, meaning it decreases your taxable income now and distributions are taxed at your marginal tax rate when you take them in retirement.  Roth IRAs use post-tax money that can be withdrawn tax-free at any time.  Earnings from Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free after age 59.5.  For those making more money currently than they will be taking out (and therefore, being taxed on) during retirement, a 401k is better than a Roth IRA.  Conversely, if you aren't making very much right now and you are in a lower tax bracket (or if you expect income taxes to rise in the future) the Roth IRA makes more sense.   If your company matches 401k contributions you should take advantage of that no matter what your income is.  Instant (sometimes there's a short vesting period), risk-free 100% return on investment.  After that, given your $75k income, contributing the full $17.5k to your 401k is, in my opinion, a better idea than funding a Roth IRA.  To increase your savings you could also think about starting a Traditional IRA, which is also tax-deferred with a contribution limit of up to $5500 per year in 2013.  Both Roth and Traditional IRAs are individual retirement accounts, meaning your employer can't match any contributions to them.  Start either with Vanguard and invest in low expense ratio market index funds.

t5_2rske,cravenewworld,1372832590,"I've been reading ""The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance."" It can explain it way better than I can.   ""What does all this mean? The loss of water and salt can reduce plasma volume and make you feel sluggish and compromise your ability to perform outdoors in the heat or in the weight room. As a result, some people get headaches and feel faint. This state of salt depletion causes a compensatory loss of potassium, which has a negative impact on muscle mass since potassium is a necessary co-factor in building and maintaining skeletal muscle. The easy solution is to routinely take 1-2 grams of sodium per day in the form of 2 bouillon cubes (or home-made broth). Some bouillon cubes contain less than 1 gram sodium so be sure to check. On days that you exercise, be sure to take one dose of broth or bouillon 30 minutes before your workout.""  Phinney, Stephen; Volek, Jeff (2012-06-15). The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance (p. 81). Beyond Obesity LLC. Kindle Edition.   AND  ""If you have ever been brought up short in training or in competition by a muscle cramp, you need to read this section. Ask most coaches or most doctors what causes muscle cramps and you will hear: a) dehydration, b) not enough potassium, or c) not enough calcium. Only a few percent of either group will tell you that you‚Äôve got a magnesium problem, but those few are usually right.   Magnesium resides inside our cells. There is very little of it in serum, so blood tests for this mineral can‚Äôt tell us if we are okay or not. As a result, doctors (who rely on blood tests for most assays), are generally clueless about magnesium.   Magnesium calms muscles (including the heart), nerves, and the brain. When magnesium levels fall in these organs, they get ‚Äòtwitchy‚Äô. Stress them with intense exercise, sleep deprivation, or not enough fuel, and twitchy becomes spasm (aka cramping). If a muscle cramps, you stop using it. If your brain cramps, you have a seizure. If your heart cramps, you die. Luckily, these last two signs of magnesium depletion are rare. But we‚Äôve all seen hundreds of athletes cramp a muscle, but seldom do they know why.   Because magnesium is critical for muscle function, there‚Äôs quite a bit of it in meat. But if you boil or process that meat (like make it into a hot dog), most of the magnesium is lost. Similarly, magnesium is the mineral at the core of chlorophyll ‚Äì the green stuff that makes photosynthesis (and thus all sunlight-powered life) possible. The darker green the vegetable, the more magnesium it contains. But if you boil it until it‚Äôs mushy, when you throw away the water, you throw away much of the magnesium.   So here‚Äôs the key to getting enough magnesium from your diet. When you cook meat, capture the drippings and add it back as sauce. If you boil meat or bones, drink the broth or reduce it to make sauce. Steam vegetables rather than boiling them, and cook them until they are ‚Äòal dente‚Äô (to the tooth) rather than soft enough to eat without teeth. Do all of these things routinely and you‚Äôll probably get enough magnesium from your diet without supplements.   But if you have frequent muscle cramps, your first order of business is to make them stop. Cramps during or after exercise, or even at night, are a sign that your body has a major magnesium deficit. So here‚Äôs the shortcut to ending most night-time or post-exercise muscle cramps. Take 3 slow-release magnesium tablets daily for 20 days. The proprietary brand-name product is ‚ÄòSlow-Mag‚Äô ‚Ñ¢, but there are a number of equally effective generics now available at a fraction of the brand-name price (e.g., Mag-64‚Ñ¢ or Mag-Delay‚Ñ¢). Most people‚Äôs cramps cease within 2 weeks of starting this dose of Slow-Mag‚Ñ¢, but you should continue to take the full 20-day course (60 tablets per bottle at 3 per day lasts 20 days). If the cramps return later, do it again, but after re-doing those first 20 days at 3 pills per day, then continue taking one pill per day. If despite this, the cramps return, take 2 pills per day for perpetuity. Most people can be titrated to remain cramp-free by this method.   Why, you may ask, do you need to use a more expensive slow-release preparation like Slow-Mag‚Ñ¢ or even its generic equivalent? The answer is that the more common magnesium oxide (such as Milk of Magnesia‚Ñ¢) preparations cause diarrhea ‚Äì they pass right through you with relatively little being absorbed. And magnesium gluconate (another popular magnesium supplement) is mostly ‚Äògluconate‚Äô (a form of sugar), so those big pills don‚Äôt actually contain as much magnesium as they do carbohydrate.   WARNING: The only significant risk to taking oral magnesium supplements is for people with severe kidney failure. If you have a history of kidney problems or known loss of kidney function, check with your doctor before taking Slow-Mag‚Ñ¢ or its generic equivalents.""   Phinney, Stephen; Volek, Jeff (2012-06-15).

t5_2s599,Burke_Of_Yorkshire,1372840478,"Lelouch laughed as he watched Kallen run circles around the odd chicken-legged mech. This gruesome battle had finally started to turn his way.   The battle itself was an oddity. As Lelouch was planning his final preparations, Diethard had notified him of what appeared to be a military outpost outside an abandoned town. The strange thing was, Diethard couldn't figure out what military the forces belonged to. And they appeared to posses some formidable weapons technology. Technology Lelouch could use to defeat Brittania.   So the Black Knights came full force to the city, prepared to fight for that technology. They were able to enter the city and set up a base of operations fairly quickly, and then they began to sweep the surrounding areas in search of the enemy. Unfortunately, the enemy found them first. A pair of the armor clad soldier ran into Tamaki and his squad. The pair was able to take out three of the squad before fleeing. Tamaki was amongst the three killed, and his death was a huge blow to morale. The battle had barely begun and already there were murmurs of discontent. Lelouch knew he had to act fast, and end this battle as quickly as he could.  He came up with a very simple, but workable plan. Kallen would lead several groups of KMF's on raids against enemy mechs. Meanwhile Toudou and his troops would go through the woods and flank the mechs, and focus taking out infantry and supplies. His own standrad infantry would be creating a line of defense, hidden amongst the buildings, with his elite Black Knights serving as the vanguard.  He also made sure to place the few snipers he had on rooftops, under orders to shoot the officers only after the raid began.  The beginning of the raid went smoothly enough, both Kallen's and Toudou's group taking out their fair share of mech and infantry, before retreating deeper into the city. His snipers reported that they had taken out at least a dozen officers and NCO's, which was better than he had expected. All three group accomplished their goals with minimal loss.  The raid's result was predictable. After having officers killed, supplies destroyed, and mechs lost, the soldiers did the predictable thing and followed the raiders deeper into the city.  As the enemy  troops moved through the city Diethard was able to capture and interrogate a few of them. When he asked about their leader, all he got was some non-sense about a blue man. He said he got the same answer from all those questioned, so it must have been a pre-designed way to say ""fuck you"" to your captors. His analysis was that if you kill the leader, they will crumble fairly easily.  When the enemy was about 500 yards from the defensive line, they all stopped dead in their tracks. Suddenly, their mechs started bombarding all the buildings in the city. Building after building crumbled, and the buildings holding Lelouch's men were about to be next. So he forced himself to give an order he had sworn he would never give.  ""Charge!""  The black knights came at the armor clad enemies from all sides, leaping out of windows and off rooftops. They fired bullets, threw grenades, and fixed bayonets while their standard infantry made the 500 yard charge. They soon made use of the fact that while their cover was laser-proof, it wasn't bullet-proof.   The brutal infantry battle had begun. Blood spattered the concrete and screams filled the air. Lelouch quickly ordered Kallen's troops to intercept all incoming calvary, while Kallen herself would join Toudou and his troops in taking out the chicken-legged mechs. Which left the bigs ones to him.  Lelouch grinned as his personal Knighmare Frame, Gawain, rose into the air.  As he settled himself at a good height in the air, he now saw that the large mechs had turned their attention toward him. He grinned, knowing that they thought they had him. Lelouch then fired his main weapons.  Out of The Gawain fired two beams of pure destruction across the city, squashing the humongous mechs like bugs. He then flew towards enemy HQ.  He looked down at the enemy HQ, and grinned madly at what he saw. Soldier's stopped dead in their tracks, looking up in horror at the monster that had just obliterated their greatest weapon. He landed and approached the command tent, tearing it open with ease. What he found left him shocked. Sitting there amongst many officers was blue skinned, red-eyed, man.  ""Huh."" C.C. muttered while munching on her Pizza Hut‚Ñ¢ in the co-pilot's chair.  Lelouch shot her a glare, and then opened fire on the officers, killing them all. Including the blue skinned man.  -------  Later that night, after the battle had been won and the wounded healed,  Lelouch sat in his office pondering the battle. He was left with many questions, technology, and enemy soldiers who had joined his side once they heard of their commander's death. As he sat thinking over all these things, there was a light tap on the door.  ""Zero, I have something you need to see."" Diethard said as he entered the room.  ""What is it?"" Lelouch asked tiredly, wondering what could possibly be exciting enough to bother him.  ""We found this when we were cleaning up the infantry battle. It was clutched in the hands of an old man."" Diethard said like he was reporting the news, while hesitantly handing over the metal cylinder.   Lelouch examined it and found only one button, where upon pressing a *WHOOSH* sound was heard and alight glow lit the room.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2tx47,sneakystratus,1372852490,"I asked for a dog for every single birthday and christmas growing up; when I moved out of my mom's place she got one. Figures.  I almost became an amputee because I was at girl scout camp one summer and they decided they wanted our group to embark on this little activity called a 'creek hike' which basically meant wading through a creek for a few hours. Unfortunately they didn't check the weather before doing this, and we ended up a few miles away from camp, in the water, in a thunderstorm. The counselors decided it would be a good idea to speed up the process of our getting home by taking us through a different, more direct creek. Unfortunately, they hadn't ever been through that creek before, ever.   I was SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC about stuff back then, so I was in the front of the pack of course. For some reason, the counselor didn't think to try out the new, *faster route*‚Ñ¢ themselves before sending kids in. Getting into this particular creek section involved vaulting over a log (should have been my first warning, really) into a pool of deeper water below.   Welp, the creek was super muddy and you couldn't see beneath the surface at all. It was also deep enough to conceal an entire fallen tree. So I vaulted over this log like they told me to, and landed right on a fallen tree. My right leg got skewered like a shish kebab, on the inside right above the knee. Kids started freaking out because there was blood everywhere. I somehow managed to climb off the branch (since it was in my leg and that felt REALLY DAMN WEIRD). I didn't really feel much, just fleshy stuff coming out of my leg, really. Not a very good sign but hey whatever!  So I walked the rest of the way back home with somebody's shirt wrapped around my gored limb, and went to the nurse's station. Because of the angle of entry, the wound looked quite superficial. The nurse washed it off with hand soap and put a bandage on it and sent me to dinner.  I spent the next few days coming back for bandages, complaining of increasing amounts of pain. I had to start wearing trousers rather than shorts because I was spending all my time swatting flies away from my leg. I kept telling them something was wrong, but they wouldn't offer any help other than to clean the wound with more hand soap and give me new bandages.   This continued for a few days until they found me on my back in the woods, feverish and hallucinating. I distinctly remember zebras and lions in the forest. Apparently I'd been sent out to collect firewood. A rather large woman who went by the name Zamboni carried me to the nurse's office where the 'weekend nurse' was on duty rather than the one I'd been seeing all week. She took one look at me and told them to get me to the hospital ASAP.  We get there and it turns out that my leg is *super duper infected* from the fact that it was stabbed very deeply by a stick in a creek of stagnant muddy-ass water. Well no shit. So the next thing they decide to do is to squeeze pus out of it, which is allegedly medically necessary. They had to have four nurses hold me down because I was literally (I thought) fighting for my life. I screamed and screamed and screamed, it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced ever ever ever ever.  I was then informed that the wound was gangrenous and that it was highly likely, unless they could get the infection under control, that I'd have to have my leg amputated due to the extent of the infection. I was put on a huge course of antibiotics for who knows how long, and every couple of hours I had to clean the wound out and put cream inside of it (as in inside my leg, holy shit). I wouldn't let ANYBODY fucking touch me after what happened before, not even my parents. So I did it myself. Fingering a leg hole you're not supposed to have every couple of hours isn't the most fun thing ever, but I did NOT want to be an amputee because I was already bullied in school, and I rode horses at the time and I didn't want to have to stop. So I kept truckin', like you do.  Anyway it eventually worked, because I didn't have to get my leg sawed off. I spent an entire summer inside watching TV and eating toast, but at least I still have a leg.  That's my almost-amputee story. There's another more ridiculous story of mine in my comment history, haha.  I have a lot of stories :/  And as to that book, no I haven't heard of it, but it sounds awesome and I'll look into it! There's a similar-ish book called Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks. You might want to look into it; it isn't fictional but it's super interesting.  And yeah, getting a sproingy runner's leg would be kinda cool, but it would just be on one leg so my running might get a bit lopsided :p  Nice meeting you :D",‚Ñ¢

A few boys might, too (the one at [1:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AtZfNU3zw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=101s) seems interested).

Basically the onus of proof of incorrectness was on me not on the Church.Till this day, I can happily say that the Church's wisdom is still winning all my debates.",üòä

t5_2qh0u,Spartan2470,1372874845,"From the photographer:  I shot this image at a stone quarry in Rampura, near Bangalore in India, while researching a story on the living and working conditions of labourers employed in the granite industry. I walked into the pit and came upon two boys operating a drill and planting dynamite sticks. Suddenly one of them looked up at me. His eyes were a startling blue and set like sapphires in his dust-covered face. I tried to ask him his name but he just stared and continued to drill. I though the roar of the machine had drowned out my voice, but then his friend told me that he was hearing impaired. The two boys had grown up in the quarry, because their parents worked there too. The constant exposure to high intensity blasts had damaged the blue-eyed boy‚Äôs motor-neuron functions. I just had to click because I wanted to show this image to the world as a testimony to the dangers of child labour. Even though it was officially banned in India in 2006, child labour is still a huge problem. Sadly, I never did find out the boy‚Äôs name. Selvaprakash L. India ¬© Drik/Majority World",¬©

t5_2qhk3,Rattatoskk,1372883290,"This.  This is exactly what I was getting at.  Feminism does science in reverse.  It starts with the conclusion and works it's way back to the facts.  And when the facts don't match, they simply manufacture them, or create the fact-finding in such a way that the figures they are looking for come out.  For instance, 90% of school children are the victims of neglect or other forms of injuries.  Is this a real fact?  Well, it soon will be.  Watch.  First, I find that 90% of children have scraped knees at one point or another.  Now, I bundle neglect into the mix..  and.. voila.  90% of children experience neglect or other preventable injuries.  I'm not technically incorrect, but that fact is going to be used as a bludgeon by the people I've fooled.  They will think we have an epidemic of child neglect!  Another method I can use is to also only ask one group leading questions.  As in previous domestic abuse studies, where men and women were asked seperate questions.  These questions assumed that males were perpetrators and women were victims.  So, when the question appears for men ""Do you ever strike your significant other?"", you will get some proportion that say yes.  When this question is missing on the women's side of the questionnaire, you can't make any meaningful conclusions in regard to the ratio of male vs. female perpetrators of domestic violence.  An oft cited study is the wage gap (Which suspiciously hasn't changed from 77% since I was a child.)  This study is fallacious on many, many levels.  It is a piece of pure propaganda.  Even the number that is settled upon is faulty, because they do no adjustments for women working less hours than men.  They just chalk it up to patriarchy‚Ñ¢ at work.  So, even if women do make less than men, it is portrayed as a fairness issue.  Well, should I make as much as someone that works 6 hours more than me a week for the same job?  According to feminism, yes.  An employer should pay women the difference because.. being a woman is hard?  The logical disconnect becomes hard to bridge at this point.  So, yes.  Sociological studies.  We do need them.  But any study that begins with the answer and works backwards is bound to show bias.  And that's a huge problem, because feminism brings tons of baggage to these studies.  It begins with the premise of proving patriarchy and female oppression.  It also delights at finding huge gaps.  When it can't find those gaps, it goes into manufacturing mode.  It will simply create them whole-cloth using devious methods.  Meanwhile, there ARE issues that need attention.  There ARE inequalities.  there ARE problems that need to be seen accurately.  Because if we push too hard in one direction, we unbalance another facet of society.  It's called the law of unintended consequences.  Good intentions are not enough.  We need precise science (or the best we can manage while respecting human privacy), not opinions twisted by faulty methods into studies that we base our policies on.  That's what I mean when I talk about feminist quackery.",‚Ñ¢

After which Canonical will simply      cat ""community_comments.txt"" &gt;&gt; /dev/null  Jono is Canonical's PR. That's it. There is no community. It's all about Canonical now. Canonical doesn't care whatsoever what the community thinks.   If they cared about the community, things like the CLA wouldn't exist. Signing over the rights to my code that I contribute is not how the FLOSS world works. The CLA is FLOSS-washing. It's there to make them *appear* as though they want community input, when in fact, it's there to repel contibutors. The terms of the CLA are just as bad as any proprietary software license out there. It's meant *to make you not want to contribute*, all while making them appear like they would accept your contributions.   If they cared about the community, they would have just used Wayland, or at least forked it.   If they cared about the community, they wouldn't shifted all of their focus to mobile and started pandering to mobile carriers who will simply turn Ubuntu Touch into Verizon OS‚Ñ¢ or Orange OS‚Ñ¢ and load it with crapware and bloatware.   If they cared about the community, you would still be able to see the words ""Linux"" or ""Free Software"" somewhere on their website. Remember when Ubuntu first came out? That stuff was on their front page. Now it's buried in a page that isn't even linked anywhere on the site.   They are creating an ecosystem that is incompatible with the rest of the Linux world. And the larger they become, the more software vendors are going to write specifically for Ubuntu, with Ubuntu specific foundations, and the rest of the distros are going to be left out in the cold.   Will this harm the rest of the Linux world? No. We'll keep going just fine. But what we're going to see is software vendors port to Ubuntu, but not really to Linux in general. So progress that Ubuntu makes is not progress for the Linux community, it's progress for Canonical. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh61,hazelleann,1372908595,"Please...everyone take a minute to read this &amp; SHARE this:  My parents are both from Seoul, Korea. They came to America with almost nothing and they are now considered successful business owners. From the day they came to America, they have worked every single day of their lives.   My mother's name is Kathy and she is 54 years old. My father's name is Yong and he is 52 years old. They are at the age of retiring, but being a business owner, you deal with risks. During this time last year, we had a downfall in business. They were at the point to give up...but they were persistent to continuing their work. Now, the comeback my parents have made is incredible. Oishi Japanese Restaurant has been more successful than ever.  They aren't just ordinary business owners. They work 7 days a week, 13 hours a day. They don't just hire people to manage their business, they do it all themselves. They struggle daily with language barrier; they do not speak fluent English. The true definition of hard work and devotion, I have learned from my parents. They have NEVER given up, they have ALWAYS persevered.  Yesterday, at around 8-8:30, I received a phone call from my dad. ""Your mom is out, come now,"" he said. At first I was shocked...what just happened? I called my dad back and laughed, ""I know you're joking around, st..."" He quickly cut me off and yelled, ""Come now. This is serious."" I got in my car and hurried to Oishi.  I arrived and saw an ambulance. I ran crying, pushing everyone out of my way. Thank God. My mother had been alright. She was dazed and confused from what just occurred. I smile and told her I will take care of all the questioning and translation. I could feel the frustration and pain she had felt laying in that ambulance.  I went back towards the restaurant and tried to figure out what was going on. Our regular customers had remained at the scene for statements the police would need to investigate.   A couple had come in. They were seated in the middle of the restaurant. They complained (the AC stays on, considering the heat in Inland Empire) and asked to be seated by the door. They ordered plenty of drinks and a few rolls. All the drinks had been finished, and the food was barely touched. The girl (late 20's) walked outside with a cigarette, so my mother didn't make any accusations. The man (late 20's-early 30's) stood up and began to walk towards the other entrance. My mother grew suspicious and followed the man with their final bill. He rejected to pay and began to make gagging noises in her face. My mom ran out the door the woman had went out of and held her arm, pleading to come back in and pay. The man saw my mother holding onto the woman asking her to pay....he ran over and threw her against the restaurant's window then began to kick and throw punches at her. My dad heard a noise and saw my mom's face against the window and demanded one of our servers to dial 911, and went out to defend my mother. As soon as he went outside, he was hit in the head multiple times. The police arrived. Some witness' stated my mother had jumped on the woman and choked her, another said my dad put the woman in a chokehold. Let me remind you, the 4-6 customers waiting outside had been there and witnessed everything, but their statement were not taken. The police forced us (my family and I) to stay inside with a degrading tone. I was yelling and cussing, confused why they hadn't taken everyone's statements. One of our customers, Malano kept telling the police exactly what I have just written and he was cuffed for obstruction of investigation. The couple were never once cuffed. They sat on the grass, smoking a cigarette. They were free to go bring their car in front of the restaurant; however, my family and I were forced to stay inside and threatened to be taken to jail. I demanded we press charges...Do you know what happened? They said the fact that my mother tried to stop the woman from leaving to pay her bill triggered everything. They said my dad had the woman in a chokehold so he is charged with a felony. Why didn't they taken the statements of the other customers? Why didn't they record anything the other customers that had been there when it ALL HAPPENED?   Here's the funny thing, the cop says, ""Well, the couple doesn't want to press charges on you guys, so what do you want to do?"" Um excuse me?! My mother and father just got their asses beat for what? Trying to hold the woman to pay her bill? It also turns out (supposedly) one of the witnesses was an undercover cop from San Diego. He was the one to question the couple first, he then spoke with the police. First off, why hadn't the undercover cop step in? After whatever conversation they had, it looked like they hadn't made a neutral, RIGHTEOUS investigation, but chose a side. We were spoken to lowly. We began to feel being ganged up on. Was it because I had to translate everything? Was it a racial issue?   The couple was free to go, they were able to drive their car home....drunk. Ridiculous. My parents are currently working, like every other day. As if nothing had happened, my parents are continuing their hard work and ignoring this UNRIGHTEOUSNESS bs.   WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY PARENT'S JUSTICE? Appalled to see what kind of world we live in today. Disgusted to see a woman with a man that beat an innocent, fragile woman. Disappointed to see how the system works. Shocked to see the woman beater and his broad roll freely...drunk. Sad to see justice has not been served. Heartbroken to see this happen to MY parents.   What would you do if this happened to your parents?  SUPPORT OISHI JAPANESE RESTAURANT ‚ô•",‚ô•

It's a hard job! I'm a new first time mum of an almost 3 month old little girl &amp; while I absolutely adore and dote on her, she is my life but you need a few mins to take a break and have some time to yourself otherwise you'll end up with post natal depression, trust me I know! Before my little girl was born I'd do my nails every day and now I'm lucky if I get a chance to do them once a week! I'm in no way complaining, I love my girl &amp; love being a mum but you do feel rough after having a baby, you go through a million changes both emotionally and physically - for Christ sake you just made, grew and delivered a tiny little person!  so if doing your nails make you feel better and happier, I say good for you and you should do them more often! Sometimes it's the simplest things that can pick you up and make you feel better about yourself! Your little boy is a beaut and I hope he brings you as much pleasure as my girl does to me, do your nails, do your hair, do your make up, just because you're a mother doesn't mean you should ignore all your needs! üòä X",üòä

Discuss how much ass-biting is allowed (you're beloved sister becomes top Domatrix at the Temple of Pain might not be in everyones comfort zone, nor might having said sister violated and killed by werewolves ^GOTEAMJACOB  Also level progression - It's all well and good to plan 'they go here, do this, get the item, use it on him, to cripple the zombies and then can storm the castle'.  That's cool but it's not a campaign, its just a long story arc, which is good  as I find that campaigns tend to be about 2 story arcs per tier.  E.G.: Heroic tier 1-5 rough outline: PCs explore an isolated land ruled by vampire barons, end up finding the oppressed people and helping them, ultimately killing the baron of a town. Level 5-9 Chunter off on some player background related side quests and I threw in gardmore abbey. At 9-10, overall vampire lord puts the squeeze on the liberated towns and their allies so the PCs need to take him out hitting paragon in time for: level 11-15 - a large tiamat worshipping hobgoblin horde comes from the east to ravage the newly liberated land. (adaption of the Red Hand of Doom Module). At the end of that they will either have annoyed a lich or killed it (or possibly allied with it), defeated the army (or not) and unless they die horribly will have pissed off tiamat. Optional allies (and thus NPCs) include some elves in a nearby forest.   Then from there it gets wooly as so much depends on what the players do. ""Dragons and a horde, screw this I'm getting out of dodge"" - which is annoying, but assuming you have mature players and they aren't doing this o dick you about it has to be a legitimate option.  Also while the *illusion* of choice is good, choices have to have consequences to be meaningful. Picking bad option A or bad option B (ally with the beholder or with the mindflayer... hmmm!) and so on. An example is that in said vampire-y game, the players found a pearl artifact of the sun god, but rather than give it back to the temple they decided to keep it. Now when they go back The cleric (who was their ally) has turned to an evil god to gain power to defend his town.

Epub 2011 Jul 8.  **Cognitive function of 6-year old children exposed to mold-contaminated homes in early postnatal period. Prospective birth cohort study in Poland.**  Jedrychowski W, Maugeri U, Perera F, Stigter L, Jankowski J, Butscher M, Mroz E, Flak E, Skarupa A, Sowa A.  Source  Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. myjedryc@cyf-kr.edu.pl  Abstract  In the last decade, the neurologic effects of various air pollutants have been the focus of increasing attention. The main purpose of this study was to assess the potential impact of early childhood exposure to indoor molds on the subsequent cognitive function of 6-year old children. The results of this study are based on the six-year follow-up of 277 babies born at term to mothers participating in a prospective cohort study in Krakow, Poland. The study participants are all non-smoking pregnant women who were free of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. The presence of visible mold patches on indoor walls was monitored at regular time intervals over gestation and after birth up to the age of five. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) was administered to children at age 6. The exposure effect of living in mold-contaminated homes on the IQ scores of children was adjusted for major confounders, known to be important for the cognitive development of children such as maternal education, the child's gender, breastfeeding practices in infancy, the presence of older siblings and the prenatal exposure to lead and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The adjusted IQ deficit attributed to longer exposures to indoor molds (&gt;2 years) was significantly lower on the IQ scale (beta coeff.=-9.16, 95%CI: -15.21, -3.10) and tripled the risk of low IQ scoring (OR=3.53; 95%CI: 1.11-11.27) compared with references. While maternal education (beta coeff.=0.61, 95%CI: 0.05, 1.17) and breastfeeding (beta coeff.=4.0; 95%CI: 0.84, 7.17) showed a significant positive impact on cognitive function, prenatal ETS exposure (beta coeff.=-0.41; 95%CI: -0.79, -0.03) and the presence of older siblings (beta coefficient=-3.43; 95%CI: -5.67, -1.20) were associated with poorer cognitive function in children. In conclusion, the results of this study draw attention to the harmful effect of early postnatal exposure to indoor molds on children's cognitive development and provide additional evidence on the role of environmental determinants in human cognitive development.

In addition to avoidance of further exposure to these environments and to items contaminated by these environments, a number of approaches have been used to help persons affected by exposure to restore their health. Illness results from a combination of factors present in water-damaged indoor environments including, mold spores and hyphal fragments, mycotoxins, bacteria, bacterial endotoxins, and cell wall components as well as other factors. Mechanisms of illness include inflammation, oxidative stress, toxicity, infection, allergy, and irritant effects of exposure. This paper reviews the scientific literature as it relates to commonly used treatments such as glutathione, antioxidants, antifungals, and sequestering agents such as Cholestyramine, charcoal, clay and chlorella, antioxidants, probiotics, and induced sweating.*  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654247",¬©

They made us go back to the drawing board and have our architect totally redesign the project because they said it was in the 100-year flood plain. Our board was very disgruntled at the Ottawa bureaucrats. &gt; &gt;We argued the project was at the same level as the main floor of the Hudson's Bay store on 8th Avenue. Was the Bay going to get flooded? The final design ended up with garages and storage on the main floor with the living space on the second and third floors. &gt; &gt;My photos and TV coverage showed the cars floating out of the Sunnyhill garages, along with an abandoned police car. I am hopeful that upper floors of the co-op are not damaged. And yes, all of downtown including the Bay was evacuated. &gt; &gt;By way of this letter, I am publicly eating crow.

t5_2xgf6,New_Theocracy,1372992057,"&gt; Secondly, reality doesn't care about our ""metaphysical intuitions"", which are the basis of premise 1.   Wow, another anti-philosophical science statement. If you reject your metaphysical intuitions I would love to hear how your worldview makes any sense at all. Such intuitions are:  * Nothing can not produce something (which you affirm rather than just positing a static universe) * Causes precede or are simultaneous with their effects * Laws of Logic  * World of external objects actually exists (only one science may have disconfirmed for me depending on whether I accept Subjective Idealism)  &gt; P1 certainly isn't based on observation and experience, since as someone else pointed out, we have never observed things beginning to exist in the sense that P2 claims the universe does,  This is a philosophical argument that utilizes scientific data in to support the second premise. I already posted justification for premise 1 as to why something that comes into being requires a cause. I will post it here for you.  Justifications for the first premise.  * Argument for the first premise.  1) Being from non-being (BfNb) is not possible (Ex-nihilo, nihil fit)  ¬¨ B*f*Nb  2) Being from non-being is the same as something coming into being uncaused (Buc)  ‚àµ B*uc* ‚Üî B*f*Nb  3) Therefore, something coming into being uncaused is not possible   ‚à¥¬¨ B*f*Nb ‚Üî ¬¨ B*uc*  4) The negation of something coming into being uncaused is something coming into being caused (Bc)  ‚à¥ ¬¨ B*uc* ‚Üî B*c*  5) Therefore, whatever comes into being must have a cause  ‚à¥ Bc  * Supplement for premise 2 (why being necessitates cause) from the previous argument  1) Non-being (Nb) does not posses any attributes (A), powers (P), or qualities (Q)  Nb ‚äÉ [ ¬¨ A ‚àß ¬¨ P ‚àß ¬¨ Q]  2) Being able to cause (C) something entails being (B), and is a power.  C ‚äÉ B ‚àß C ‚äÉ P  3) Being is the exact same as the negation of non-being  B ‚Üî ¬¨ Nb  4) Therefore, Causes implies Being and the negation of Non-being (if something is caused then it is caused by being)  ‚à¥ C ‚äÉ [ ¬¨ Nb ‚Üî B ] ‚àß C ‚äÉ P ‚äÉ ¬¨ Nb  &gt;P2 claims the universe does, so there is literally no inductive support for the comparison  This is where the science meets the philosophical component. All of our scientific data points to an absolute beginning of space-time (you could posit a series of contractions prior to the Big Bang, that has serious issues). Not to mention that an infinite series of events is impossible. We have excellent justification for Premise 2.  &gt;P1. Everything that results from a reconfiguration of pre-existing stuff has a cause. (supported by every observation, ever)  That seems to be ad hoc and short sighted. What cause the pre-existing stuff?  &gt;P2. The universe came into existence from nonexistence, NOT as a reconfiguration of pre-existing stuff. (an idea contrary to all observation and experience)  Already showed this to be false, not to mention RationalZealot posting some info about this.  &gt;Thirdly, science has been in the business of disconfirming our intuitive assumptions for several centuries now. It is intuitive to assume your hand is touching the mouse right now, but it isn't, since there is a repulsive force between the atoms of your hand and those of the mouse that prevents them from ever coming into contact.  Whether I am touching something or not is an intuition for sure, but it is not necessarily a foundational metaphysical assumption that I hold. My metaphysical intuitions are like what I posted above. Whether I touch something or not is a novel fact.  &gt;It is intuitive to assume you are a solid object, when in reality over 99.999% of your volume is empty space (which is why radio waves and other particles go straight through you).  Whether I am solid or not doesn't really matter to me. I personally believe we are acquainted with ourselves as immaterial beings anyways (metaphysical intuition) so this doesn't disturb my worldview.  &gt;It is intuitive to assume time runs at the same rate for everyone, when in reality simply moving in one direction or another through space you can alter the ""now"" moment for someone else from your perspective..shifting them into the past or future.   This appears to be a B-theory objection. I think it can be shown that B-theory is nonsense and Presentism is the correct theory of time, however, Kalam can be formulated to be time neutral so it can apply to A and B theory.  &gt;It is intuitive to assume solid electrons in the double slit experiment can't possibly go through two different slits at once, but they appear to do so.  Don't see why that is intuitive. The experiment was exciting for sure, but I don't necessarily see how it is challenges our intuitions about the world.  &gt;Fourth, even if we grant all the assumptions of kalam and all of it's premises, the argument has several formal fallacies which render it invalid. This post would be far too long if I listed them all, but you can see them enumerated here: http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Kalam  HA, ironchariots is a very poor resource for counter-apologetics. I would recommend you use some of the intellectually stronger atheists like Graham Oppy, Mackie, Quentin Smith, et al. All of their objections seem to fail, especially Barker's. I will address this in a reply to my comment.  &gt;since any sort of sequential causation requires time to already be in existence.   Causation can be of two sorts (disregarding the distinction between efficient causes and the like):   * statestate: one event causes another * Agent: agents can start new causal chains that are not pre-determined by the events of the immediate or distant past and the physical laws of nature.   The only rational conclusion is to assume that the causation of the beginning of the universe was Agent, as there is no time for a cause to precede the effect in the case of the beginning of the universe. God would be the agent cause that causes the universe simultaneously with its coming into existence.  &gt;&gt; To be timeless is to be literally frozen..unchanging..not able to move, think, act, plan, or cause anything.   Lolwat, that is definitely not what timeless means. To be timeless is to not be in temporal relations with any material objects, or, as dictionary.com defines it: to be eternal. God enters into a state of temporal relations with His creation of the Universe.  &gt; Yet it is said that a being existing in a changeless state changed the state of affairs.  You fail to understand what Theists mean by God's immutability. Let's go over it real quick.  ""‚ÄúBy his immutability we mean that it follows from the infinite perfection of God; that he can not be changed by any thing from without himself; and that he will not change from any principle within himself that as to his essence, his will, and his states of existence, he is the same from eternity to eternity. By the Immutability of God is meant that God's nature is absolutely unchangeable. It is not possible that He should possess one attribute at one time that He does not possess at another. Nor can there be any change in the Deity for better or for worse. God remains forever the same. He is without beginning and without end; the self-existent ""I am""; He remains forever the same, and unchangeable.‚ÄîGreat Doctrines of the Bible, The""   ",‚Üî

Finally, two days later, (this poor 16 year old Junior Counselor had to spend 2 full days living in a cabin that constantly smelled like someone dropped a deuce in the middle of the room) it got concentrated enough that we tracked it to a locked trunk belonging to one of the boys. Since the boys had left for skills for a few hours and we wanted to take care of that shit (no pun intended), we got some bolt cutters and a new lock from the camp store and got on in there. Turns out the kid had laid down a huge dump in a bathing suit, and instead of letting someone know (or just tossing the bathing suit out if that was too embarassing), he had stuffed it into his laundry bag, then locked that in his truck, deciding that he'd just wait out laundry day. All I can say about it at this point is that thank god we found it before then, because the lovely russian ladies that did our laundry would not have been very happy about that load.",¬Æ

t5_2rh4c,vizualbandit,1373068561,"Ok, I've been lobbing a bunch of hate at Jay-Z recently in this sub, and I always preface it by saying that ""I love Jay-Z""‚Ä¶and I do, very much. I love his flow, his swagger, his rhymes, his stellar production, his friends in high places, and everything that makes him who he is. I love that he is the living, breathing embodiment of the Hip Hop success story: Rising from selling dope on the streets, to becoming a truly self-made man. I love Jay-Z.  With that in mind, we come to Magna Carta Holy Grail. I had my doubts on it right from the beginning: The stupid name, the sudden release announcement right on the coattails of Yeezus (an album I loved, for the record), and the ridiculous deal he has with Samsung making it a Platinum album instantly, in comparison to, say, Kendrick, whose debut album took around 6 months to reach Platinum. I wanted to put all of this hate aside though and just listen to the thing, with no reservations, and I did.   So, it makes me incredibly sad to say that Magna Carta Holy Grail was exactly how I feared it would be. 16 songs: Not one of them with a memorable beat, all with phoned in versus, nothing but boastful odes to his wealth, his connections, and so many comparisons to artists (seriously, how many times was Basquiat's name mentioned on this record?). He even samples Biggie's lines again, I guess the answer to [NaS' age-old question](http://rapgenius.com/Nas-ether-lyrics#note-8915) is ""as long as it makes me money"".   It's bad. It's not just bad, it's an insult. This is not the Jay-Z we know and love. This bloated, lazy rapping might be good for some, but I expect better from him. Even now. Occasionally Jay-Z can still do well, such as his excellent turn on the ""Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe"" remix, and on much of Watch the Throne. But here, it just doesn't sound like he gives a shit about the music. Why would he, when he can debut his (incredibly shitty) album artwork next to the actual fucking Magna Carta? Jay-Z doesn't give a shit, he's already made millions and the album dropped fucking yesterday. He doesn't care about you, about me, or about anyone listening, or buying the record. He cares about spreading the Jay-Z brand name, and that to me is so upsetting from a man who is still so capable of doing better. I wanted him to prove my inhibitions wrong so badly, I wanted him to drop something incredible that would make me think twice about doubting him, but instead he drops a steaming, gold-plated turd where the most memorable line is about Miley Cyrus twerking. Maybe he'll finally be able to prove me wrong on Watch the Throne 2 (as he did on the first one), but for now, he is no longer Jay-Z. He's Jay-Z‚Ñ¢. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh5b,GallopingFish,1373078815,"&gt;...anarchism is a popular movement to destroy capitalism.  No, that's just anti-capitalism. Anarchism is a school of thought that society need not archons.  Saying Anarchism is a popular movement to destroy capitalism is like saying Atheism is a popular movement to destroy feudalism.  Some states call themselves capitalists, and this does not imply that capitalism is inherently archistic any more than feudalism implies inherent theocracy.  &gt; Before everything that came later, it was a reaction against industrial capitalism...  Maybe the brand of anarchism you subscribe to has this quality, but anarchist thought can be traced back to Laozi millenia ago.  Also, Individualist Anarchism is not inherently anti-capitalist; while there are some who consider themselves Individualist Anarchists who are anti-capitalists, it is patently false to categorize Individualist Anarchism entirely under anti-capitalism.  Hell, Lysander Spooner's ""No Treason"" was at the top of /r/anarcho_capitalism about all day yesterday.  &gt;[""Neoliberal capitalism""] promotes highly totalitarian and dictatorial power systems... If you mean ""voluntaryism"" or ""anarcho-capitalism"" by ""Neoliberal capitalism"", then I have no idea what you're talking about.  If you mean to refer to The United States' system now or ever before, then I agree.  &gt;...endorses boss/master-worker/subject relationships...  You mean ""allows for voluntary employer-employee relationships"", right? Because master-subject implies slavery and human ownership which AnCap does not condone.   &gt;...endorses class domination and a highly stratified society...  Those are pretty specific indictments which are not implied by ""private ownership of the means of production"".  &gt;...endorses usury, absentee ownership, rent-seeking...  If you mean ""allows for people to lend their money as they see fit"", then yes, it allows for usury.  Absentee ownership is always a quagmire, but is not necessarily implied by capitalism.  Rent-seeking is first and foremost a problem with public, not private capital.  &gt;...has not even thinly-veiled contempt for the poor and underprivileged...  So now an ""ism"" can feel feelings, like contempt?  If you mean that those who consider themselves AnCap have such contempt then I must take exception to  this; this sentiment is not found anywhere in anything I have read and indeed many AnCaps have their views because not only do they see them as much more humane toward the poor and underprivileged, but they hold the belief that there would be much fewer poor and underprivileged to begin with.  &gt;redefines ""voluntary"" as ""anything done without the barrel of gun pointed at your forehead""  So, knives don't count? Man, those AnCaps ARE silly. /s  Seriously though, this is a case of ""I think their definition is too broad"", and AnCaps think standard Left-Anarchist definition is too narrow.  Truthfully, though, the answer is highly dependent on the individual cases of alleged coercion, and AnCap theory makes no hard claim as to what constitutes it.  Generally speaking, you are right, AnCaps have a broader definition of ""voluntary,"" but it would be as silly of them to say that Left-Anarchists consider any and all influence on another person, even mere argumentation, as coercion and thus not voluntary.  &gt;Anarcho-capitalism is viciously, religiously hyper-statist.  Yup, and bears are religiously, viciously, ducks.  &gt;It seems, at first glance, that his lifestyle of lavish luxury is funded by the surpluses of our labor -- and yet we are subordinates who barely bring home enough to keep the lights on.  You're making assumptions. Look, I can do it too.  ""We are on a Left-Anarchist mutualist society and they're all resentful of their system because they don't have enough. There may be some resentment brewing...""  Really, if you want to build a case against AnCap, you can't assume that it would lead to subsistence living for wage earners.  Hell, you can't even assume wage-based pay at all.  Remember, the current symptoms of US ""Capitalism"" would not necessarily exist in AnCapistan.  &gt;living paycheck to paycheck  Assumptions...  &gt;the deflationary gold currency we all usethe deflationary gold currency we all use  More assumptions...  &gt;(for anyone who happens to have made the silly mistake of using money instead of hoarding or lending it)  How about saving? Investing?  &gt;we now each owe (the equivalent of) 9,000. Bummer.  That sounds terrifying! But assumptions!  &gt;but it's not so great for us.  Well isn't that convenient. Assumptions!  &gt;Joe isn't doing squat though,   One cannot just say someone isn't doing anything.  Just because the workers don't appreciate what he does, does not mean he does or provides nothing.  It's like saying, ""Salesmen don't do anything for the company because all they do is talk to customers.""   &gt;""Joe! We're running this factory ourselves now. We're sorry, but we're going to have to let you go. We don't want you involved anymore.""  Wow, that was a dick move.  Why would they do that instead of finding work elsewhere, if it's that bad?  &gt;and then some private armed thugs come barging in, kick the piss out of us and throw us in a (private) cage.  Well, I would say that's rather drastic and costly a measure for a private defense agency to use.  I would imagine that less risky and costly methods would be tried first.  A notice, a summons to arbitration, and then if all diplomatic options fail, physical security guards (bound by liability for their actions and thus unlikely to be more violent than necessary). Don't assume that private defense agencies would act like public police forces; the incentive structure it totally different.  &gt;Wait, but that's what would have happened in the crummy state-y society we have now. What gives?  Your assumptions and biases. That's what.  &gt;So, I'm walking along a private street in the city and someone stops me, to extract a toll. After all, property is a license to use and abuse (and there's nothing but fucking property) and I'd be trespassing, in violation of the NAP if I didn't comply. But I say ""nope, sorry -- don't believe in this private property shit; gotta get to where I'm going"" and keep whistling daisy down the road. Aaaand then some totally competitive private police come out of the bushes, and break my legs. Hmm.  So, by your own logic, I could ""use your orifices"" because I ""don't believe in this private property shit"".  Wait wait wait ""property and possessions are different."" Well, I don't believe in possession either, because it's just as much of a construct as property.  How do you feel about respecting others' reasonably and peaceably defined boundaries now?  And there you go with the assumptions about vicious private defense firms. Tsk tsk.  &gt;There's something weird going on here. It sure doesn't feel like a stateless society. Maybe it's in the definition.  Maybe... it's because you don't actually understand what you're criticizing.  &gt;""Anarcho""-capitalism is actually a form of statism that wants to privatize the state and make it completely unaccountable to the public.  See above.  &gt;We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical ([Rothbard] Are Libertarians ""Anarchists""?)  &gt;(to be fair, he later went on to argue that they are not ""archists"" but I think the quote speaks for itself)  Actually, you took the quote rather out of context, thankyouverymuch.  Also, even if you didn't, it wouldn't make a damn of a difference because there's no substantive conceptual difference between ""nonarchy"" and ""anarchy"", even if there is an etymological one.  &gt;What alternatives do anarchists on the market-abolitionist end propose? Usually one or more of the following: gift/informal credit economy something sort-of like council communism or libertarian municipalism for economic decision making some sophisticated system of decentralized economic planning like parecon some sort of money-less markets-kind-of-but-not-really system, like an extensive distributed network of mutual credit linked by chains of community trust some labor-voucher like system, possibly combined with a different system for non-essential goods.      Wow, if only there were some way of establishing an informal way of distributing resources that did not rely on an external authority... Oh yeah, currency.  We can just do currency.  &gt;There's no right way to be an anarchist‚Ñ¢ and no shortage of ideas. On top of that, different communities, might prefer different systems, and that's okay.     I agree! What were we arguing for anyway?",‚Ñ¢

t5_2s30g,Greyfeld,1373082301,"&gt;it isn't nor should it be feminists vs MRA  You're right, it shouldn't be.  Unfortunately, feminists started it, and the MRM isn't going to just lay down and take it.  When trying to talk about the issues that men face gets shouted down and laughed out of the room, there's a problem.  When feminists actively try to silence and suppress peoples' right to talk about men's issues, there is no middle ground that can be had.  &gt;My issue with still saying it is ALL feminists making men be subservient or ALL men making women subservient is its close ties to us vs them/colonization ideals.  If it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, just pretend that rants against feminism is purely in regards to the [gender feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_and_gender_feminism) that stands on the shoulders of Patriarchy Theory‚Ñ¢.

The CDC‚Äôs **Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health Care Settings** states that alcohol-based hand sanitizers reduce infections. The highlights are:  ‚Ä¢  Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce bacterial counts on the hands of personnel more effectively than plain soaps.   ‚Ä¢  In a majority of studies, alcohol-based hand rubs reduced bacterial counts to a greater degree than antimicrobial soaps.   ‚Ä¢  Alcohol-based hand rubs can be made more accessible than sinks and other hand washing facilities and require less time to use effectively   ‚Ä¢  Alcohol-based products caused less skin irritation and dryness than the soaps used for hand washing.

Here‚Äôs the gist of the study:  *Noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in the United States, and human hands play an important role in their transmission. Little is known about the efficacy of hand hygiene agents against these highly infectious pathogens. We investigated the activity of seven commercially available hand hygiene products against human noroviruses by in vivo fingerpad tests. The in vivo activity of alcohol-based handrubs ranged from 0.10 to 3.74 log reduction and was not solely dependent on alcohol concentration. A handrub (VF481) based on 70% ethanol and a blend of other skin care ingredients reduced Norwalk virus (NV) by 3.74 log in 15 s and provided significantly greater NV reduction than all the other products tested (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, VF481 was the most effective product tested against the NoV genogroup II strains Snow Mountain virus (GII.2) and a GII.4 strain. These results demonstrate that alcohol by itself is not effective against NoV, but effective formulation of alcohol-based handrubs can achieve significant reduction of norovirus RNA on fingers.* ",¬Æ

It was the tart of July (great month), and Season 4 started! And holy shit at the videos! Okay, right now, the Part 1 playlist has *89 videos*. EIGHTY-NINE VIDEOS! The most prolific week in Mindcrack history. Season 1, had 64 videos *total*. It took Season 2 46 days to reach 89 videos, and Season 3 20 days. Took Season 4 a week flat. Hence, that makes this, by FAR, the longest Vanilla Digest yet. I've *never* had to extend the post, and now half the post is the comment! Even in the Jayothan days it wasn't this big. [Look at this Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1bw3w1/mindcrack_vanilla_server_digest_41134713/). Only twelve videos all week! And not even that, oh no, Season 4 starting was not enough. MC had to go host Zeldathon this week. Freaking Zeldathon! Look, I'm not a big Zelda fan. Half the time I have no idea what's going on in the game. But the people are hilarious and the cause is very noble, and MC and Pause are there! So that's the score, that's why this Digest is so good. At the start, Season 4 felt kind of wrong. How can this tiny temp house and wheat field be the Mindcrack spawn? Season 3 will never be forgotten, but I'm slowly easing into Season 4. And it will be the best season yet. The other announcement is that the Playlist Project *will be ongoing*.

For example:  4 via dp on AMD10 and 4 via gtx760 = 8 displays  or  3 via haswell and 4 via gtx 760 = 7 displays  or  4 via AMD10 and 2 via HD 7750 = 6 displays  or   any other combination etc.  do these configurations work in reality, or would another issue arise that prohibits this configuration?",¬Æ

t5_2r7mh,l_l_l_l_l_l_l_l,1373157825,"The scientific consensus of GMOs is an absurd claim considering they are already banned in over twenty countries worldwide. You seem to like the phrase ""conspiracy theorist"" is that one of the latest Fox New-isms to neutralize any real discussion by blanket stereotype?  Speaking of conspiracy theories isn't it a little funny that the former Monsanto vice president is now the food safety czar for the FDA? That seems like a cruel joke, however that is sadly the truth. I think that speaks deeply of the kind of inside political corruption that is actually behind the forcing of these GMOs.  You see many people are not willing to give Monsanto the benefit of doubt when it comes to such monumental issues such as introduction of GMOs into the environment. And we are already seeing this happen with rice and wheat, and to what consequence nobody can say.  You seem pretty dedicated to laud GMOs which is an odd thing, you would think that monopolization and centralization of our food supply would generally be a bad thing. DNA patenting of our food is OK? Corn becoming Corn¬Æ, or how about caution on the possible health effects of eating GMOs? why would they fight to stop labeling of GMOs so that people could choose? And not to mention the vicious cycle of GMOs and their pesticide brothers. Show me proof that they are of any benefit to mankind and not for only profit, control, with complete environmental degradation.  Calling people names who actually want caution and disagree to which the speed these things are getting forced out ""nuts"" and ""conspiracy theorists"" and then making false equivalence based on two vastly separate issues is some the most egregious type of non thinking on this issue.

Here's a brief overview: http://www.organicitsworthit.org/natural/natural-vs-organic  Also, everything I have read about cooking oils (canola / vegetable) say that they will degrade latex condoms.

DO NOT USE OIL-BASED LUBRICANTS, such as those made with petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline¬Æ), mineral oil, vegetable oil, or cold cream, as these may damage the condom. Avoid contact with talcum/baby powder because it may contain oil.""  According to that vegetable oil will break down, so saying something won't breakdown a condom because its organic (or natural) doesn't make sense.   From my googling I can't find a source specifically about coconut oil being safe or not, and since condoms are my only BC of choice at the moment Im not going to risk it.

Eventually falling down the stairs that Billy Apple‚Ñ¢ had critiqued as part of an institutional critique. Much later Daniel Malone as Billy Apple emigrated to Poland.  Malone's practice has a continual crit of Barthes - Death of the Author. The ending eulogy lines of the essay is that ..' with the death of the author, you give birth to the reader'. Kind of trimming that fat off the celebrated name and just being 'the artwork' and the viewers(gallery vistors) reading/allegory of the work. Daniel plays on this theme so much so it's the author as undead.  But of course you can't be antihistory and totally kill off the author, so the input as an author is rightly preserved.   New Zealand does like it's undead in arts, such as following with Govett Brewster stream. The Len Lye Centre. Which is going to create works that Len had only sketched in books. Resurrection of the Author.   Authenticity of the object does come up into thought. Creating these works after the death of the author, so no certification by the author obviously. Being it a collection, does it get valued and insured in reign as if any other object by a celebrated artist gets sold in auction. I do not know.   What Karl Sim did is interesting, the big thing is that it is in a field that is not artwordly... as in not involved as part of an exhibit in an Art Gallery.  Buyers of the works were under the guise that they were 'authentic objects'. As he was in the antiques trade, you can kind of imply by this ruse he was taking the piss out the art market. But still fraud happened.  Sentencing is [amusing](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/7817/kawakawa-public-toilets), taking this into thought.

Not to say you can't have more training, but that's what most of them have. On top of that you usually have crew bosses with additional training, fallers, maybe other training. The fallers usually have the greatest amount of training.  As for a hero, I'd say a person who does good consistently while passing up better/self serving, less moral, options. I don't think you can become a hero on impulse or some instinct like jumping on a grenade or saving a baby. You need to fully realize the consequences of your actions and still choose the option that will hurt you and help others. I think a hero needs to be tempted by the non-hero option, rather than be disgusted by it.   As for situations outside of ones control... have you ever looked at motor vehicle accident deaths? Lots of people drive to work and die en route, but they could just stay home.  I hope you look at my other reply as well. As I'm going to discontinue the 'argument/debate'.

t5_2qh1i,ascott72,1373183770,"JULY 2, 2013 A MESSAGE OF GOD, BROUGHT BY RAFA√ãL, WHO ON BEHALF OF THE LORD GOD, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACKOB, WAS SENT TO BERNESE OBERLAND, IN ORDER TO INTERVENE! Please share and do not change ¬© BC   Full view:  Hello, welcome! In the evening on July 2nd, 2013, the angel of the Lord brought on this message of God to Benjamin Cousijnsen.  Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, I am the messenger angel of God and my name is Rafa√´l.  Verily, in the Bernese Oberland, I, Rafa√´l, met a young man. His name was Barnie. I knew him well, but he did not know me. Barnie said, ""Sir, what are you doing? Are you crazy! Get your hands off my stuff, leave those boxes, or I'll..."" Yes, I just looked at him, and he was as meek as a lamb. ""Where are you from?"" asked Barnie. I am an Israelite and I'm looking for work. ""I've got a job for you, as a mail deliverer. But then you do have to know streets. Do you have a little experience?"" asked Barnie. Yes, I know all the houses and roads and have already been everywhere, all over the world. ""Come, have a cup of coffee,"" said Barnie, ""then we'll talk further there.""  Verily, Barnie told that he was a wizard. Proudly, he told me he was also a member of a coven of witches, and that he came together with 13 members, in order to worship the gods. How much power do you have? I, Rafa√´l, asked. ""Well, I use black magic. In that way I can convey painful growths to someone. I even set once a house on fire with a spell. And I can make myself invisible and make a bird drop dead from the sky, and I can predict the future!"" And I, Rafa√´l, I said, am here to predict your future. ""Are you then also a wizard?"" No, I said, a demon expeller! I look them up, when the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gives me the order. Then I get down there in His power and might, and will chase the demons and overpower them, and will tie them up. ""Then who are you?"" asked Barnie. Your nightmare, I, Rafa√´l, said. Thus it is written:  Micah 5, verse 12 to 14 Here it is written: I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; And you shall have no soothsayers. I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst; And you shall no more worship the work of your hands. I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst; And I will destroy your cities.   Galatians 5, verse 19 to 21 Here it is written: Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.  Leviticus 19, verse 26 Here it is written: You shall not eat any meat with the blood still in it; neither shall you use enchantments, nor practice sorcery.  And verse 29 Don't profane your daughter, to make her a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness. And verse 31 Don't turn to those who have familiar spirits, nor to the wizards. Don't seek them out, to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God. Leviticus 20, verse 6 Here it is written: The person that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to play the prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.   And Revelation 21, verse 8 Here it is written: But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, whoremongers, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.  Barnie cried, ""Stop it!"" Then I revealed myself as the messenger angel of God. Barnie had had so many chances, and had so often rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, that the demons spoke through him. He'd been so taken over, that his soul was replaced by the fallen angels! I said:  Exodus 22, verse 18 Here it is written: You shall not allow a sorceress to live.  And immediately he dropped down dead! Verily, God is a swift witness and is more than a conqueror. Wizards and you, who practices witchcraft: God hates the works of satan! and will cast also you into the lake of fire. This is my and God's prediction, and that one comes true. Repent, and break with it! Accept Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, and beg for forgiveness, before it's too late.  John 3, verse 16 and 17 Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.

t5_2qi4z,CountVonTroll,1373190028,"Yeah... Let's have a closer look at this.  Based on the dimensions of a pack of 50, a 1oz pack of Fritos has a volume of 734ml. Portage from the US, based on USPS' ""Priority Mail¬Æ International Large Flat Rate Box"" (edit: [link](http://ircalc.usps.com/MailServices.aspx?country=10137&amp;m=6&amp;p=4&amp;o=0)), is ‚Ç¨4.68 per liter, or ‚Ç¨3.44 for a 1oz pack.   If you bought two of those 1oz packages at this vendor that charges ‚Ç¨6.60 for shipping you're already very close, and for three or more you're better off ordering from there.   Keep in mind that this is already based on the assumption that you make ideal use of the cheapest cost per volume from the US (that I could find), and a rather expensive way to buy them in Germany. On the other hand, they weight almost nothing, so if you have enough space left in the package, by all means, throw some in there.  Btw., weight. Let's do some math with that. This time, I'll base my calculations on the *medium* flat rate box, which is more efficient for this purpose at $59.95/20lbs. That's $0.19/oz or ‚Ç¨5.20/kg.   Let's say we want to ship jars of Skippy peanut butter. We want ""super chunk"", which is a bit more expensive than creamy, and we opt for the 16.3oz jar. Based on the price for a pack of six at Amazon.com, the German vendor charges ‚Ç¨2.67 on top of what it costs in the US, which is about the same as shipping from the US when you allow the remaining ‚Ç¨0.27 for the weight of the jar (again when you make perfect use of the 20lbs weight allowance of the flat rate box). This vendor *does* charge ‚Ç¨4.90 for shipping within Germany, which makes it more expensive, but on the other hand, they also have most of the other stuff people talk about here, like those Fritos you like, but in a more reasonable package size.  tl;dr: Shipping from the US is expensive as fuck.

t5_2qhbp,ibrahim91,1373193511,"I‚Äôd just like to say at the beginning that I am not a scholar or perfect unfortunately, but I do have a view on the statements you have made...  1.	Who said we cannot drink water standing up? We can drink water whilst standing, but rather it is better for us to imitate the prophet [](/pbuh) which means following the sunnah e.g. sleeping on our right ‚Äì recently a discovery has been made to show that this is the best position to sleep in terms of our health and scientifically. However the primary reason to follow the sunnah is to gain good deeds and these worldly benefits of following the sunnah is just a bonus. So following the sunnah is beneficial in one way or another. It is not Fard so you will not be sinning if you drink standing up 2.	There are so many fun things we can do that are within the limits, if you look at the effects of the media you will realize that there is more harm in it than benefits. Just watch the arrivals from beginning to end. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaqybvymYIE&amp;list=FLaybta14sBYWRsYU0zYHA_g Not everything fun is Haram, I find this a shallow statement e.g. we can take part in playing sports, meeting up with good friends and family members, playing console... 3.	There are things you can do for a blessed and tranquil relationship. Duahs you can read and also performing istikhara. You will see that most people who take part in premarital relationships have suffered heartache and it changes their views and opinions of the opposite gender. The Islamic way is there for us to be safe and not go through anxiety with regards to our partners 4.	Just because someone seems happier, inside the house there may lie a different story. Even within the person, a person may seem happy on the exterior whereas in reality this person can actually be depressed. Life in this world is temporary and the more hardships we go through the more Allah [](/swt) wants us to stop craving for the temporary pleasures of this short life and look to the future and hereafter. This life is like hell for a believer and heaven for nonbelievers whereas the hereafter is eternal so wouldn't you say that it is worth it? ""And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e. their account] for a Day when eyes will stare in horror"" (14:42). Allah accepts Dua's in three ways: you are given what you asked for in this world, you are given what you asked for in the hereafter, you are given something different/better than what you asked for 5.	There are so many signs that god exists but I think that maybe due to you listening to music and being exposed to the media they have done a good job on you. Look at your heart, is it you that makes it beat? Look at the sun, is it you that makes it stay in one place and give the plants light and create all this food for us? I don‚Äôt mean to be rude at all, it‚Äôs just I ask myself these kinds of questions all the time. Make sure you don't end up in regret when you are 50/60 years old 6.	The things you will hear in the media about the prophet are not going to be exactly true. Read up on him yourself‚Ä¶ he was a mercy to mankind and suffered terribly just so that we can avoid falling into the traps of this dunya. Seerah of the prophet to be more precise on what to read 7.	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdN4-GmXuDE&amp;list=FLaybta14sBYWRsYU0zYHA_g&amp;index=63 just watch that and you will realize why Halal is a blessing ‚ò∫  Consider the fact that Islam is the religion that is gaining more followers than any other religion. People come to this religion and gain peace from it. Don't be a blind follower. In it there is truth, but you yourself have to search for the truth and patience is essential. You have to be open minded to watch the Arrivals. I‚Äôd appreciate a reply after you have watched the series. Anyway, I hope you have a good life and when you are older you might start asking yourself deeper questions such as what is your purpose in this life or were you created in vain. Don't worry Allah [](/swt) is most forgiving. Take care.  As-salamu alaykum.",‚ò∫

Never apologize for critiquing ideas, that's that reason they exist. 2. you're*, ¬∂, ¬∂, ¬∂  ------------  As it is right now, with the US economy flagging, the American Dream‚Ñ¢ is simply unattainable for the vast majority of Americans. Capitalism with a debt-based monetary system and a plutocratic corporatocracy has failed. We have to change one or all of those descriptors or we'll just continue to plunge.  So can we at least agree that there is a problem - if not agree on the definition of the problem or how to fix it?  ------------  The 'finish line' idea... I really don't think it would eliminate hard work. There are plenty of companies around the world that have a government imposed income, profit, and/or market share cap and they function every day to do the best they can at what it is they do.  If there is a personal income cap of 10x median income, you still have a reward. You still have incentive. In today's money it would be ~500,000k a year. That's not something to sneeze at. The vast, vast majority of employees would be nowhere near it (hence basing it off of median income - it would be mathematically impossible).  The concept that putting a cap on success would destroy motivation to work is completely ridiculous on its face. Just look at history. This is the first time in man's existence that we've had more of a reason to work hard than to simply survive. There wasn't/isn't the possibility for upward mobility in the vast majority of cultures on earth, and yet the peasants still got up every day.  You don't have to have the possibility for **unlimited** success to foster motivation - especially if your workforce begins to realize that possibility is ever-shrinking.  You can make an argument that it would hinder innovation, because it certainly would. In order to innovate or do basic research, it would either have to be small scale, co-op research with several other companies, or you'd have to basically have to start a solely 'research' company and sell your ideas... But as it is now there isn't as much corporate-based research going on anyway - ideas that aren't popular or immediately monetizable aren't even considered.  ------------  Limits on transfers of wealth: Again, I see the point here. It does seem rather callous and probably not enforceable. But again its about having each generation make or break on their own merits. Clearly there'd be no way to limit how much you spend on pre-adult children, so you would still be able to get your children the finest education and as many advantages for life as you can.  And put yourself in the shoes of a parent here. What's the 2nd thing you do (the first being trying to find a way around it)? Personally I'd probably set my child up with a world-class well rounded education. Then I'd make sure he got into a good college, and set up a job for him somewhere.  Just imagine even the wealthiest people having to work. Again, look at history and around the world, it's not a universal guarantee that your wealth passes to your offspring... It's a relatively new idea.  I do agree it's not enforceable and rather callous, which is why I pretty much abandoned it.  ------------  More Socialized Capitalism - You sort of stumbled upon the answer in your rebuttal, but then fumbled it.  &gt;The problem with comparing America to the European countries and their social programs is the size difference. When you have a country like Norway with 5 million highly educated workers paying a very high tax rate to live the way they do and compare it to the 300 million Americans  Exactly. 5 million highly educated Norwegians. Highly. Educated... They are not highly educated by mistake. Was Norway always highly educated? What changed? Well, they started paying a substantial amount of their income in taxes and providing a higher education to all citizens.  They didn't look around at all of their highly educated people and realize they could highly educate the next generation by taxes... The complete reverse happened. They educated their population and are now destroy the rest of the world in nearly any index you'd like to attribute to them.  So you go slowly... You start with healthcare; A healthy workforce is a more productive workforce. At the same time you institute 'paid higher education' for needed jobs (nurses, doctors, welders, etc.); Jobs that are in demand are filled. In 5-10 years, you add in some federally required vacation time; A rested workforce is a more productive workforce. 5-10 more years and you slowly expand 'paid higher education' for less needed jobs... 5-10 more and you expand again to all higher education to a masters (or a doctorate for needed jobs)...  ------------  But that last one still doesn't address the problem of wealth hoarding. The greed-driven grab for as much wealth as you can get your hands on doesn't help anyone other than yourself. Money must be a finite resource to work. When you look at the western economy it's readily apparent that the top 20% of the people owning 80% of the wealth is simply not sustainable.  Without fixing that problem, you're just spinning in circles. I think we can all agree that the complete communist/socialist paradigm of fixed wages and government-run everything is a very bad idea. But that doesn't take into consideration that maybe, like with most things, a measured approach is best.  We already have socialized healthcare and income for the elderly and the sick. Clearly those were good ideas. Our people are living longer and have a life after work to look forward to. So putting limits on income and taxing according to that income might be sustainable.  There will always be moochers, but the vast majority of people rise to the level you allow them to. Why chastise a man for mooching instead of working when any job he got would be just as low paying as his welfare? He has no incentive to work. He has no money to go to school to get a better job. He has no incentive. Is that his fault? Maybe... But, it's just as much our fault for dismissing him as a moocher and not considering he might be a product of the very systems we've put into place.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1373223441,"I get it often enough that I've just got my response to it saved in a wordpad file.  ----  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  ----  Bonus:  &gt;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.   Hebrews 13:8  &gt;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, **with whom there is no variation**  or shifting shadow.  James 1:17  &gt;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?  Numbers 23:19  &gt;He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.""  1 Samuel 15:29  &gt; For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

It's technothriller about how humans could drop centralized government in favor of decentralized commerce/regulation by letting a well-designed logic tree (the ""Daemon"") turn the world into an MMORPG. Below is a quote from TV Tropes that lines out what I mean:](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Daemon?from=Main.Daemon)  &gt;**The Game Come to Life**: The entire plot. Early on, the autonomous Hummer is believed to have been programed with videogame-style logic and CyberStorm's games are used to recruit talent for Sobol's cause. Once recruited, operatives use Augmented Reality glasses to carry out ""quests"" in the style of a MMORPG; agents gain levels and earn ""network credits"" for completing tasks such as building tools and weapons, infiltrating and suborning governments and corporations, recruiting and training new operatives. As the Daemon network becomes more sophisticated and populated by warm bodies, the combat and infiltration operations become less important and focus shifts to building a new civilization based on **sustainable communities** and acceptance of technological and social change. This was Sobol's plan all along; comparing the shortcomings of modern society to the strong, [**stable Player Generated Economies**](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip) of CyberStorm's virtual worlds inspired him to use his decades of development experience to create **a Player Generated Civilization**.   [](/sp) [](/a01)  Touching more closely on your point of relying more on local government, in the Freedom‚Ñ¢, long-distance conquest of resource-rich nations causes the Daemon to penalize communities in self-sufficiency and sustainability points. Communities need to prove to the Daemon (an emotionless logic tree) that they've earned sufficient network points in order to unlock access permissions to tools important for civilization (for example: 3D printed industrial equipment, lawyer hours, schoolteachers, road maintenance, civil protection, weapons). Since it's difficult for communities consisting of millions of people (nation-states) to convince the Daemon that their community as a whole meet self-sufficiency criteria (among others), smaller communities tend to develop instead. One benefit of having many self-sustaining communities is there is no single point of failure for civilization (unless you can somehow subvert the Daemon's control over everyone ... without getting assassinated by one of the Daemon's ""infrastructure protection"" factions).",‚Ñ¢

Indeed, the researchers used multi-variate regression to control for confounding variables like depressive symptoms, age, gender, and education - so it is likely that the MMSE results are strongly associated with some of these other attributes and these attributes skewed the results.  Perhaps one of the attributes from the Piracetam cohort was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline.  But here's where it gets weirder - the two main differences in the Piracetam cohort from the other groups were Depressive Symptoms and Memory Complaints at Baseline. So, does that main that these two attributes at Baseline are linked with a slower cognitive decline 20 years later? Seems counterintuitive. And the paper doesn't give beta values for these attributes.  Don't look too closely at the findings regarding Piracetam. The sample size is way too low (N=~150) and there are too many unanswered questions regarding confounding variables to make any definitive calls. They say this themselves:  &gt; Regarding, the finding of stronger decline in the group using piracetam, due to the small number of participants in this group, it is difficult to draw conclusions.  **TLDR: Don't read too closely into the Pira results. Low sample size and big differences in cohort compositions.**",¬Æ

t5_2qhwp,genotaru,1373244377,"All three of your points are basically saying that their structure doesn't work, and I just don't see the evidence for that. A company doesn't have to be public to want to improve their products, they are human beings just like the public that would be investing in them. They want to make more money and they want to do better work, just like anyone else would. If anything, making the company public would only hurt their incentivization, as it would decouple those two goals and encourage change for the sake of profit rather than change for the sake of improvement.  And sometimes, there doesn't need to be an incentive to change in the first place. When a company is doing something right, they probably shouldn't change that. Being on a constant lookout for ways to squeeze a little bit more out of a product or service can be fine to a point, but if you take it too far you'll end up alienating your customer base that was happy with how things were.  If they do have a problem with agility, which I would not contest, I don't think it's a structural problem.

t5_2ryd5,iloveyou1234,1373246057,"I'm not sure what you are saying here. is the gospel of John known to be non-historical, while the synoptics are? because it seems to me that all of the gospels claim to be the truth, or at least different interpretations of it.     If we are looking at only the synoptics, I have found 0 evidence that shows that Jesus was divine. His very own religious beliefs contradict this. However, when some non Jews read the phrase ""son of god,"" they take it literally (silly pagans), thus creating a divine interpretation of jesus in the synoptic gospels that simply does not exist. It is clear that the Jews in the NT misunderstand Jesus constantly about almost every aspect of his teachings because of his metaphors and parables, so why not include the misunderstanding of his claims of kingship as claims of divinity? I argue that the catholics seem to do just that. They have also changed the meaning of the word Messiah/Christ from **Jewish human king** to divine king, which is literally impossible in Judaism because the king only represents god.   2 Samuel 7:13 ‚ÄúHe shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. (14) **I will be his father, and he shall be my son.** If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:  1 Chronicles 17:11-15 11 	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that **I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons**; and I will establish his kingdom. 12 	He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 13 	**I will be his father, and he shall be my son**: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: 14 	but I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 15 	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.  **Psalm 2:7 I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me: 'Thou art My son, this day have I begotten (adopted) thee.**   if we then move on to the gospel of John, we are presented with a few ambiguous phrases that portray Jesus in his ""Super Jesus‚Ñ¢ form"" (thank you, MarkanPriority). the ones that have appeared so far on this page (most presented out of context) only present Jesus as divine if one goes into the bible already claiming the trinity, which comes from a bunch of Romans in the 4th century. _shadrach_ gives a wonderful explanation on this page, and i could not upvote him more. The majority of such phrases really only portray Jesus as **representing** god as the messiah, including accepting worship and forgiving sins. He does all of this **in the name of god**, as he constantly reminds people of. His death came at the hands of the Romans and was instigated by the hypocritical priests who did not want to give up power. The Romans went along with it because **claiming kingship would be a direct attack on the authority of the roman senate that appointed kings at the time.** let me go over a few of these verses:  **John 1: 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.... 14 ""And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.""**  this is just like how Wisdom is given credit for creation in Proverbs 8. It **does not** make jesus part of the ""godhead,"" another pagan invention:  ‚Äú22 The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,     before his deeds of old; 23 I was formed long ages ago,     at the very beginning, when the world came to be. 24 When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,     when there were no springs overflowing with water; 25 before the mountains were settled in place,     before the hills, I was given birth, 26 before he made the world or its fields     or any of the dust of the earth. 27 I was there when he set the heavens in place,     when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep, 28 when he established the clouds above     and fixed securely the fountains of the deep, 29 when he gave the sea its boundary     so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth. 30     Then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day,     rejoicing always in his presence, 31 rejoicing in his whole world     and delighting in mankind.  **John 10:30 ""I and the father are one.""**  This is fully explained in John 17:20-26 as being one in purpose with god, which is the messiah's job.   20 ‚ÄúMy prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one‚Äî 23 I in them and you in me‚Äîso that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.  24 ‚ÄúFather, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.  25 ‚ÄúRighteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. 26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.‚Äù   **""before Abraham was, I AM"" in John 8:58.**  I liked _shadrach_'s explanation so well that I will use it here:  &gt;Christ's reference to Abraham is to affirm his (Christ's) pre-eminence, not pre-existence. The Jews had claimed that Abraham was their father (vs. 39) and so Christ establishes his pre-eminence in the divine purpose by stating that before Abraham was, ""I am"". He did not say ""before Abraham was, I was"" as it is frequently misread. But the Jews, like modern-day trinitarians, misunderstood Jesus. He was not claiming to be literally older in years than Abraham. This is indicated by his prior remark: ""Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad."" (vs. 56). Abraham, to whom the gospel was preached (Gal. 3:8), ""saw"" the day of Christ through the eye of faith. Christ was ""foreordained before the foundation of the world, but manifest in these last times"". (1 Peter 1:20). He was foreordained in the divine purpose, but not formed. Similarly in the divine purpose he was the ""Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"" (Rev. 13:8) but literally he was not slain until his crucifixion in the time of Pilate.  &gt;There is no proof that Christ alludes to the divine name (imperfectly rendered by the King James version, ""I am that I am""). Jesus simply uses the present tense of the verb ""to be"". Even if this verse were intended to be read as an allusion to the divine name, this is not proof that Christ was claiming to be God himself. The divine name declared, ""I will be what I will be"". (Exod. 3:14 R.S.V). The name was a prophetic declaration of the divine purpose. Jesus Christ was ""God manifest in the flesh"" (1 Tim. 3:16), ""the word made flesh."" (John 1:14). As such, he was the expression of the divine character, ""full of grace and truth"" (John 1:14 cf. Exod. 33:19), and became the ""firstborn among many brethren"". (Rom. 8:29). Christ was the result of the word made flesh, not the originator of the divine plan. As he himself said, ""I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."" (John 8:42).  &gt;The words found in the Greek for ""I am"" are ""ego eimi."" If one examines the Greek text for Exodus 3:14 as found in the Septuagint, you will not find a direct match. The Septuagint translates the divine name as found in Exodus 3:14 as ""ego eimi ho ohn"". These words translated into English mean ""I am the Being"". These words are not found in the Greek New Testament for John 8:58, however. Instead, we find ""prin abraam genesthai ego eimi"" or ""before Abraham was, I AM"" in John 8:58.",‚Ñ¢

FDA has recently (as of 2002) expanded the approved use of this device. INTEGRA¬Æ may now be used to treat the often disabling scars that result from severe burns.  INTEGRA¬Æ has two layers. The bottom layer (dermal) is made of a fibrous protein material (collagen) from cows and a substance made from shark cartilage. The top layer (epidermal) is made of silicone.  **How does it work?**   When INTEGRA¬Æ is placed on a wound where the burned skin or scarred tissue has been removed, it allows blood vessels and other cells to grow a new layer of skin while the collagen is absorbed into the body. The silicone layer helps close the wound and prevent fluid loss. After approximately 14 to 21 days, the silicone layer is removed, and a very thin graft of the patient's own skin (autograft) is applied to the wound area.  **When is it used?**  INTEGRA¬Æ is indicated for use on:  Patients with severe burns where there is a limited amount of their own skin to use for autografts or they are too ill to have more wound sites created.  Patients undergoing reconstructive surgery for burn scars where there is a limited amount of their own skin to use for autografts or they are too ill to have more wound sites created. ",¬Æ

Briefly speaking, the singularity will follow an hyper exponential progress, where hyperexponential constitutes a pure mathematical singularity, that is, ·∫üf(x)/·∫üx‚Üí‚àû.  The reason for this is that the singularity is about combining several exponential evolutionary processes, where most of these, like [Moore's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), currently only work at the local level so far, due to patents, proprietary technology, commercial copyrights and other reasons for lockins. when you combine several evolutionary processes in a multiplicative manner, then you achieve a hyper exponential (also denoted super exponential or [tetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration)).  However, assuming that the other evolutionary processes, like Moore's law would suddently hit a plateau, then the singularity would only be exponential, but... with a huge derivative anyway, as the function will be Ordo(7000000000^t ) which for all practical purposes can be denoted a singularity.",‚ù£

Islam tells you to pray five times a day, and teaches that the God of Jesus is the one true God that Mohammed praised.

t5_2qh61,Bretai,1373301434,"Abstract Background:   Penile incarceration or strangulation is a urologic emergency. Objectives: Several techniques to remove metallic objects strangulating the penis are described in the literature. The method utilized depends on the severity of the incarceration and the tools that are readily accessible. Prompt action and resourcefulness, with expeditious removal, prevents organ ischemia and vascular or mechanical sequelae. Case Report: We describe a case in which a Dremel Moto-Tool was used to remove a lead pipe strangulating a penile shaft, after failure of the string technique. Conclusion: A hospital-based Emergency Medical Services and Rescue program is a valuable resource to provide the tools needed for management of penile strangulation. Features of safe removal, including protecting the tissues from heat damage and mechanical injury from the cutting blade, are described.  Keywords  penile strangulation; urinary retention; foreign body; Emergency Medical Services; penile ischemia Introduction  Cases of penile strangulation have been reported since the late 18th century (1). However, the introduction of automated hand-held cutting tools in the 1950s has greatly changed the way we manage penile incarceration. With the choice of method depending on the severity of the penile incarceration, in particular, penile edema, the following methods and tools have been used: string technique to displace edema, corporeal aspiration, hand-held cutting devices, and penile excision (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). No matter which method is used, the key is to quickly relieve the constriction and cause the least amount of further trauma to the patient while making every attempt to salvage the organ.  Case Report A 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presented to a community hospital with an S-shaped lead pipe around the base of his penis, which had been in place for 48 h. The patient gave a history of being at a ‚Äúbondage and discipline‚Äù party 2 days prior. He stated that the lead pipe was placed on the penis for enhanced sexual function and gratification. During the party he was inebriated and was taken home by a friend, not waking up until 18 h later, when he discovered the object still on the penis. He claimed to have been asymptomatic initially. He then tried to remove the object but was unsuccessful, and started having frequency of micturition and dribbling, with progression over the next 24 h, eventually leading to a total inability to pass urine. The patient had a distended bladder palpable above the umbilicus on initial presentation. He was subsequently transferred from the community hospital to our institution for further management, and possible penile amputation.  On physical examination, the patient had an S-shaped pipe at the base of the penis. The pipe measured approximately 7 cm in length, with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm.  Severe edema of the glans and distal penis was present. There were early signs of ischemia in the areas adjacent to the pipe, along with moderate skin excoriations (Figure 1). In the Emergency Department, after attempts to pass a small-gauge, well-lubricated catheter per urethra were unsuccessful, urinary diversion was achieved with a supra-pubic cystostomy catheter.  We initially used gradually tightening compression on the glans to displace edema, hoping this would allow the object to be slipped off. Multiple attempts to thus relieve the distal penile edema using the string method failed. Upon consultation with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Rescue staff, the decision was made to use a Dremel Moto-Tool saw (Dremel model 395 type 5, Variable Speed Multipro Rotary Tool; Dremel, Racine, WI). We used the reinforced, circular, metal-cutting blade attachment to make counter bivalve incisions and split the lead pipe (Figure 2).  First, to ensure cooperation and minimize movement during the procedure, the patient received procedural sedation with fentanyl and midazolam, after informed consent. To prevent injury to the penis from the rotating saw blade, a blunt-tipped steel file was inserted under the pipe during the cutting process (Figure 2). Also, a continuous slow flow of cold saline was directed at the cutting site via intravenous setup, to prevent heat injury to underlying skin from the saw's revolving blade (Figure 2). Staff wore protective gowns, masks, and goggles. The patient wore a plastic mask shield to cover his face and eyes, and drapes to cover the exposed skin. We also ensured that there was no open oxygen source in the vicinity. After the bivalve cuts were complete, one on the dorsal and the other on the ventral aspect along the whole length of the pipe, it was easily removed (Figure 3). Distal penile edema resolved slowly over the next few hours after relief of constriction. The use of the protective steel file and cold water prevented any further mechanical or heat-induced injury to the penis. There was minimal underlying skin breakdown from ischemia (Figure 4). The patient was spontaneously voiding per urethra, without difficulty, immediately after the constricting pipe was removed. Tetanus prophylaxis as well as a prophylactic antibiotic (Levaquin¬Æ, Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raritan, NJ) was administered to prevent infection in the ischemic and macerated penile tissue from the perineal skin flora. The patient was discharged home the next day after removal of the supra-pubic catheter. He declined counseling to address his alcohol abuse. Follow-up with the urologist revealed healing skin, resolved edema, and no further urinary complaints.  Discussion  This case demonstrates the need for a step-wise approach to manage penile incarceration. The first priority is to address the patient's ability to urinate, and the need for urinary diversion. In this case, urinary diversion was achieved with a supra-pubic catheter. To prevent complications from penile incarceration, such as ischemia, decisions as to which method or tool to use should be made quickly and be based on resources that are readily available in the institution (2, 3 and 4). Hospital-based EMS/Rescue or Fire departments often have multiple tools readily available to cut through automobiles, locks, and wooden doors when needed for patient retrieval. Therefore, they are an excellent, easily accessible resource to consider in similar emergent situations (4). Thus, penile gangrene or urethral scarring due to prolonged ischemia, as well as a necessity for penile amputation, can be prevented.  The removal of a constricting metallic penile object is possible with the use of a rotary Moto-Tool. This is a high-speed, hand-held, portable rotary device manufactured by Dremel Tools and often called the ‚ÄúMoto-Tool‚Äù or an ‚Äúelectric Swiss Army knife.‚Äù Because there are a variety of attachments and accessory kits available, it is versatile for cutting, sanding, drilling, and polishing. It can be used on wood, metal, and plastic as well as dry wall by a variety of users, including homeowners, craft and wood-working enthusiasts, firefighters, EMS providers, and dentists. Further injury to penile tissues is averted with the use of cold water to prevent thermal injury, and the use of a steel file to prevent direct mechanical injury from the high-speed rotating blade. Others also describe the use of tongue blades and using ice on the penis to protect against further tissue injury (4). Protection against sparks by adequately draping exposed skin areas with non-flammable material and providing eye protection with goggles or plastic shields is necessary for both operator and patient.  Conclusion  Emergency Medical Services can assist in providing the hand-held tools needed for management of penile incarceration by metallic objects. Expedited relief of penile constriction prevents vascular and mechanical sequelae.  Acknowledgment  We would like to thank the EMS/Rescue staff, especially Karl Schweiger, Mary Berghoefer and Mark Rooney for their expertise and assistance in the patient's management.  *for readability ",¬Æ

I already don't like you.  Jokes aside, your weight is fine, maybe even a little on the skinny side.  &gt; I tried keto  Me too. And I found out that keto, especially ""trying keto"" in the beginning, and heavy workouts are a difficult combination. Lack of carbs gave me low blood sugar and the characteristic zombie look quite a few times.  I am a bit sceptical on whether it's a good idea to try that all at once. If you want to stick to keto, /r/ketogains has some good resources on how to do that diet correctly in combination with exercise.  &gt;Stimulant-Free Dual Impact‚Ñ¢ Stack I take this to lower my carb cravings.  I am really not sure about that one. I mean, if you do not want to deal with carb cravings, don't do keto. It is not the ideal diet for anaerobic training anyway, since carbs are great for recovery. Sure there are ways around that, but it makes things needlessly complicated.  In the beginning it is enough if you gain an overview of what and how much you eat, and adjust that according to your aims. That is easier than playing around with the particular problems a keto diet can bring. You can do that once you have established a healthy training habit. Doing both at the same time might be a little much.",‚Ñ¢

Then shut your Fundie pie-hole and share my blog on facebook.  When something is a sin but underemphasized then sins that are over-emphasized become not-a-sin. They zero each other out. It's basic SCIENCE but you fundies wouldn't know that.  Except when it comes to violence.  Every sin may be ~~ignored and excused~~ contextualized in a spirit or mercy except violence. Because that HURTS people.  Would God REALLY make things sins that didn't hurt people?  It's not like God ever said not to take his name in vain or something. Words are JUST words. Genitals are JUST incidental like hair-color.  Believing in a teleology in the ways God created our bodies is hateful. Bodies don't matter, the incarnational son-of-God told me so: not in the Holy Scriptures of course. The Biblical texts are NOT the word of God. JESUS is the word of God (and if you bring up how Jesus quoted the Old Testament and called it the ""word of God"" so help me, LITERALIST!, I will rain down fire upon my keyboard setting the internet aflame with my evangelical-progressive indignation as I launch every verse about Pharisaical hypocrisy I can quote-mine and apply it directly to YOU...)

However...  I have not seen any study or survey that notes a homeless person's region of origin (for Victoria). Nor have a seen anything that looked at crimes committed by homeless and broke it down by age.  Furthermore, the [last survey of homeless in Victoria that had info for how long someone had been in Victoria was 2005.](http://www.homelesshub.ca/Resource/Frame.aspx?url=http%3a%2f%2fcoolaid.org%2fpublications%2fHomeless_Survey.pdf&amp;id=45979&amp;title=Victoria+Homeless+Count+2005&amp;owner=121) There was a survey in [2007, but it didn't go as much into the population break down and was more about discrimination and such.](http://www.coolaid.org/publications/HNS_Final_Report_2007.pdf)‚ô£  That said, if we are going to nitpick over an offhand statement like...  &gt;‚ÄúThe attitude comes from younger people who come here from out east, Toronto, Montreal.‚Äù  We should note that nobody said that the these rowdy, non-local homeless youngsters made up the majority of our local homeless population, just that they are responsible for the ""bad"" homelessness. It sounds like a No True Scotsman to me, but I have no way to prove it. The onus is on the police or this blogger to prove the truth of their words.  ‚ô£Which raises a question: how can our homeless programs be effective when when we are working off data that is almost 10 years old? That's ridiculous. Shouldn't we be doing surveys and gathering stats every year so we can track changes over time? Are abuse and addiction still the number one reasons for homelessness in Victoria, or has that changed?",‚ô£
t5_2s3kh,Anton00b,1373325906,"Follow-up!  My ears got a live demo by accident - revealing that it actually was a motion detecting alarm! We had left this thing plugged in, lying on the kitchen table during the day, not knowing how to use it since we had not found the controller for it.   Now in the evening it got dark, and I was going for a glass of water in the kitchen, so I turned on the lights when I entered the kitchen and all of a sudden there was a very loud beeping noise. I was completely caught off guard, but I managed to turn the lights off whilst being very confused over why what I (at the time) thought was the fire alarm going off. The loud beeping stopped and I then remembered this thing lying almost directly beneath the chandelier hanging over the table.  So somehow this thing got activated by the light coming from the chandelier. I don't know if it was because of the infrared light from the lightbulbs or the light refracting through the glass or maybe a combination thereof, but something matched whatever the lost controller is supposed to do.  So after a few seconds of gathering my senses I walk over to the table and look at this thing, noticing the green light being lit for the first time. I stare at it a little while, confused as I was, and suddenly the lights switch. From a steady green to a blinking red. It was almost as if it shouted ""exterminate"" to me, even though nothing else happened. But I could feel something wasn't good, and as I moved around I saw the red light in the middle lighting up - the motion detector.  A shreiking, terrifying, ear-piercing alarm went off, making me jump out of fear, quickly covering my ears! I didn't know how I was going to turn it off, as I had both my hands over my ears, unable to grab it and pull the plug! I put my shoulder up to my ear, covering it as much as I could, and I quickly reached for the cable and ripped it out - stopping the alarm.  tl;dr: It's a motion detecting alarm.

In 1962 at the Bonneville salt flats that man's dream finally came true.  To honor the past and power the future, Indian Motorcycle built the Spirit of Munro, an all-metal tribute bike which would house the new Thunder Stroke 111‚Ñ¢ engine. On May 5, 2013 the bike was run on a dry lake bed in California. A tribute to the great Burt Munro, and a celebration of the Indian Motorcycle that is yet to come.  ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF MUNRO: Fully custom-built, the Spirit of Munro is an all-metal tribute to the racers and mechanics throughout history who have collectively built the legacy of record-breaking racing performance and strength that is Indian Motorcycle.  The motorcycle is named in honor of Burt Munro's ""Munro Special,"" the historic 1920 Indian Scout that broke the under-1000cc land-speed record in 1967 at the Bonneville Salt Flats as famously portrayed in the motion picture ""The World's Fastest Indian.""  The Spirit of Munro was constructed by Jeb Scolman of Jeb's Metal and Speed in Long Beach, CA. It was designed from the ground up to house the new Thunder Stroke 111‚Ñ¢ engine and showcase its awe-inspiring power and performance.

t5_2qwdo,daren_sf,1373338303,"This is from the 060713 How To Play PDF in the free D&amp;D Next package:  **How to Play**   The adventures that unfold in the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS¬Æ game take place in your imagination. The Dungeon Master describes environments and circumstances, and you and your fellow players respond by asking questions, describing your characters‚Äô actions, and testing your characters‚Äô abilities to overcome obstacles and foes. This shared imaginary environment hosts the chambers you explore, the battles you fight, and the encounters you experience.  If you‚Äôre a player, these rules assume that you have a set of polyhedral dice, a character sheet, and something to take notes with. If you‚Äôre the DM, you should have dice, a way to take notes, and an adventure, either a published adventure or one of your own creation. You can use whatever visual aids enhance your enjoyment of the game‚Äîminiatures, gridded surfaces such as Dungeon Tiles, and the like‚Äîor use none at all.  ---  So where the board game *Dungeon!* takes place within the confines of the board, D&amp;D is inherently limitless. The only confines are your imagination and the DM's. The 'adventures' that the rules mention are nothing more than a story outline that the DM has purchased or created. When you ""play D&amp;D"" the player characters interact with the DM and unfold the story together.  Whereas *Dungeon!* has the goal of gaining gold and getting out alive, the goals of D&amp;D are more varied and complex. In attaining the current set of goals you gain Experience Points (XP). After you get so many points you gain a level and in doing so gain additional character abilities. Each level gained requires more XP to reach the next level. ",¬Æ

Heat milk and butter until warm (100 degrees to 110 degrees F); the butter will not completely melt. Combine with undissolved yeast and brown sugar in a large mixer bowl. Stir in salt and 2 cups flour, beat for 3 minutes. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 1. Combine boiling solution and bring to a boil. Punch dough down and divide into 2 equal pieces. Form each piece into a tight, smooth ball. Boil each loaf in the solution for 2 minutes, turning after 1 minute. Remove loaves from pot using a slotted spoon and place on a greased baking sheet. 1. Brush with egg wash and cut a cross in the top. Bake for 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake an additional 10 to 12 minutes until the loaves are evenly browned. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.  **PREP:**  20 mins  **COOK:** 27 mins    **READY IN:** 1 hr 49 mins   ###Variations: **Rolls:** Divide dough into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Use same procedure as listed above. Boil, egg wash, score top and bake for the same amount of time.   **Chocolate Rolls:** Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a disk, place 1/2-ounce of chocolate in the center of the disk then fold up the edges to seal the chocolate in the roll. Continue with same process for rolls.",¬Æ

The sort of aging you're going to see sometimes, with cheap motherboards, is systems becoming unstable (Panics/MCEs/Oopses/IEIEIEs on Linux or on Windows random bluescreens), but it so happens it's always the motherboard fault and CPU works perfectly on a different board. Generally, it means the capacitors on the motherboard have died, which you can verify visually. I avoid this sort of thing these days by not being cheap on the motherboard. I tend to use Gigabyte (their marketing is all about their UltraDurable‚Ñ¢ advantage) and pretty much anything they market as UltraDurable3 or higher is solid vs time, but I'm aware other brands also care about it to some extent. Just don't buy ASRock (ASUS low-end brand they keep separate for good reasons) or the like ""value for money"" $50 boards.

As an example, several Euro car companies do a similar thing too - BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, etc. Whilst a unique, model-specific name is nice for recognition and marketing purposes - eg Dodge Viper, Chevy Corvette, Ford Mustang - there's also a simplistic and utilitarian beauty in being able to identify a model's standing in a company's range from the series of letters/numbers in its name - eg BMW 335i, Mercedes S500, Audi A6.

Because right now we're headed real fast in the opposite direction. About the sharp parts, sure catastrophes happen, but at this point it would have to be damn near cataclysmic in nature to make the dents you seem to be implying. Also, everything you said is dependent on humanity being completely inept at solving any of these major problems. Which I will give you is a valid worry.  Additionally, I agree we are most certainly animals, but by any meaningful measure we most certainly cannot be described as ""no different"". I have yet to see any evidence of any other animals on this planet achieving our most simple technological advances (some have simple tools though). We've advanced more in the last 50 years than people 200 years ago could have imagined, and at this rate (which seems to be roughly exponential) we have no idea what we'll be capable of in 25.  In short, you have no idea what you're talking about. But that is okay, none of us do!

That is also correct, but at the end of the day most individual components in a phone are cheap. It's when you add everything together that everything, well, adds up.I do agree however that 2gb of ram for flagships should be a thing. In my mind, 512mb for entry-level devices (5xx, 6xx), 1gb for mid-range devices (7xx, 8xx), and 2gb for flagship devices (9xx, 10xx), would be ideal.

I remeber having dinner and drinking 2 20oz beers and 2 margaritas and 1 shot of patron. I don't remember leaving. Everyone says when they saw us walk in they knew someone was getting arrested. Awesome! thanks for stopping us guysüëç.  Then we decided to go to a bar and get free drinks from out bartender friend. Black out ensues. For what we gather between us and all the fuzzy. My friend, the less drunk between us, is driving. She hits a curb and pulls over. I guess I said ""really? you just hit a curb. Really?"" This must have been fighting words for her because she punches me in the face. We start fighting in the front seat of my car. Just pounding away at eachother. I don't know how we stopped but I then decide I must drive the car home.  When she hit the curb she blew both passenger tires out.  I drive the car on the rim. We get pulled over. Next thing I know we wake up in a holding cell. She's in a cell beside me, so were separated and can hear eachother but can't see eachother.  I have the phone in my cell.  Our friends report getting several collect calls that night. I don't remeber who I called how I even dialed the numbers. I remeber asking my friend to tell me the number to the bail bondsman friend we know.  She tells the guard to tell me to quit talking to her. She's never been in jail before and she's screaming and crying and carrying on. Next think I know they take her out and I don't know we're they take her.  I stayed in jail all night and when I finally got my free call I had to call work and tell them I was in jail and my friend was in jail and we wouldn't be making it to our shifts that morning. Worst night ever. That was many years ago and I learned my lesson. I have never driven and drove drunk since.  It's stupid and I felt incredibly lucky I didn't kill my friend or anyone else. No ones life is worth your good time.  I blew .29 I believe. That automatically made me eligible for the ignition interlock, tons of fines, court costs, lawyers fees, probation fees, 3 different classes, and victims impact coarse, impound fees, license automatically suspended all the fees to get it back etc etc. in all it cost me 11,000.

t5_2sgii,ihatemybrothers,1373383912,"I'm gonna say no, unless you're planning on joining forums or guilds/clans. I started playing when I was ~8 in 2003, and the game really isn't the same. I played on and off for years (quit around 2008, came back a year 2010, played again 2012- got banned‚Ä¶ working on getting acc back) and the game really isn't the same IMO.   TT was my first MMO and still my favorite. I used to play all the time, and there was never a shortage of toons. The game has been going downhill since '07/'08 and it doesn't look too good. While I absolutely loved being older and actually working on my toon (went from 111-120LP before I got banned üòä), the population has declined, it's infested with bugs/glitches, people are being banned for no reason, and it's completely filled with exploiters that aren't being taken care of.   When I began playing again I maxed sellbot, then cashbot, then started working on lawbot. There is absolutely *nobody* there or in bossbot hq. It took me upwards of 30mins standing around before 1 person came, we'd wait for others another 20-30 and they'd either leave or we'd go with a 3 person run.   The only district you can get things done is in Nutty River. It's almost 24/7, except early in the morning (2-5AM?). The way people get to NR is by friending ""taxis"" or ""parkers"", these are toons who literally do nothing but stay inactive in certain places so others can teleport to them. They're everywhere. If I wanted to work on cashbot I'd try to find a cashbot taxi, because they stay idle in CBHQ. Similarly, if I were working in Donald's dreamland I would try to find someone who parks there.  When you're in nutty river you'll mostly see taxis and parkers. It's like a ghost town, everywhere you go there will be dozens of idle 15 laff toons who will stay that way weeks at a time. It seems like there are more of them than there are active toons. They do nothing but make the district run slowly, so even if it's easier to get a group in NR the game is going to lag and you'll have a terrible time unless you communicate with your team. For instance, you won't be able to see what gags they're using until after everyone has picked. This causes many problems since sometimes people will pick the same gag, the wrong gag, or go for the same cog. By the time you've figured that out it'll be too late to change gags.  Then there are exploiters. Mostly these are children with scripts, who can't do much but change their species, colors, or get unreleased/hacked/edited clothes. You can tell who is an exploiter by their clothes and colors, they mainly are black toons other than cats (only cats can be black, and on holloween), grey toons, or white toons. They'll also have multicolored toons like black feet and white head, which is impossible without exploiting. It's impossible to get white toon effect from a toontask until later in the game, but 15 laffers do it by exploiting. This sucks majorly because if you've got white toon legitimately from a task, newer toons will report you for hacking and your account can be banned since the staff don't look into it.  Oookay, exploiters also say inappropriate things, spam, and do unreleased/unavailable emotes. Often I'll go to Toon Valley (exploiter hangout) and see exploiters sexually harassing female toons, they'll stand behind them and ""hump"" them while saying inappropriate or vulgar things. I wouldn't care that much if this weren't a children's game. The ones who do it are usually 11-15yearsold and I've seen a lot of confused 8 year olds falling victim to their creepiness.   The bad exploiters you need to worry about. They will create ""clones"" and fill a playground with hundreds of them, it's weird. They can also kill an entire boss battle by exploiting. Hard to explain, but basically they'll press a button and suddenly your entire team is dead.   Then there's district resetting. The high profile exploiters are tired of taxis and parkers, and set timers to reset districts to clear them out. Basically every few hours  your game will freeze, then you'll get a message saying the district has been reset. Other exploiters do this just for fun. It sucks when they're on a rampage and you can't play since every single district is being reset over and over.  There are also greeners in the VP. They purposely ruin the battle to kill off smaller toons, or walk into the VP while he's stunned, causing him to become unstunned and jump. You can't make any progress since they'll run into the VP until everyone is dead.  **Sorry for this loooong rant.** Toontown was a major part of my childhood and it's basically in ruins, which pisses me off. The staff don't ban exploiters since they just make new accounts. You won't be able to get anything done unless you're in a full district, and even then you'll experience mass amounts of lag. I really don't think you should come back unless you're prepared for chaos, or you join a popular ToonTown forum/clan/guild to go to scheduled meetings. Even then it's not completely safe, since exploiters often reset districts of clan runs to ruin the game for them.  ***TL;DR*** Toontown is basically shit now. Hopefully Disney is planning to revamp the game in the future, since it's been going downhill for so long (they haven't been advertising the game for years, I used to see commercials about it constantly, and special spots for it on Disney channel). They could have shut it down a long time ago. ",üòä

t5_2qh1a,valgrid,1373385745,"&gt;  I am concerned that even if I install a linux OS, there will still be ways to access the OS because I use an apple product. I am not sure what you mean by ext driver.  Well if you install Linux you will have a partition with linux and your user data. This data is accessible. The default filesystem for a desktop linux is ext4 (like HFS for Mac or NTFS for Windows), when files on a partition they are in a filesystem. The filesystem describes how the files are stored and magic (just look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem).  When you want to read data from a partition the system has to understand how the files are stored in the filesystem.   Mac OS and Windows don't understand ext4 [out of the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box). Linux on the other side does understands NTFS and HFS, but only because the big distributions (like ubuntu) deliver the drivers for NTFS with every image (and maybe HFS - not sure about that).  That means per default Mac OS and Windows don't  know what to do with your linux partition. But this does not mean your data is safe. If you assume that your Mac OS can be used by third parties then they can access the data on your linux partition, because if a third party has access to your installation it's very likely that they can install the driver. The only safe way is to encrypt your data.  It would be helpful if you share with us what you want to do with your linux installation (do you install it next to OS X or do you wipe OS X and use linux to 100%). Do you want to ""learn"" linux, because then encryption can be a bit difficult at the beginning. :)  Do you want share your data between OS X and Linux?   Just describe what your plans are and what you would like to learn / use.  Greetings valgrid  PS: There is a distribution which focus is security and privacy. It's called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/). It's not a operating system you would you day to day, but it's great if you want real‚Ñ¢ privacy without a data trail. It even has a mode which makes it look like windows XP, which is great if you want to use it in an internet cafe, where it would attract attention if your computer looks totally different.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qio8,Haegr,1373387924,"Originally posted by Blizzard (Official Post | Blue Tracker)Collapse Rygarius  New Raid: Siege of Orgrimmar  More information coming soon.  New Feature: Flexible Raid Difficulty  This is a new raid difficulty designed for pre-made groups of 10 to 25 players or any number in between. This means it's possible to have raids of 15 or 22 players! Difficulty will adjust automatically based on the number of players present with encounters intended to provide a challenge roughly between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.  Flexible Raid difficulty requires a pre-made group to join but has no minimum item level requirements or role restrictions. Both BattleTag‚Ñ¢ and Real ID friends are eligible to participate. Loot quality will be between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty and awarded through a personal loot system (similar to Raid Finder). Bonus rolls and loot specialization will also be supported.  Player spells with different target limits depending on raid size will gradually increase their limits based on the number of players in Flexible Raid difficulty.  Players will be able to earn raid achievements just like in Normal or Heroic difficulty. Flexible Raid difficulty has a lockout that is separate from Raid Finder and Normal difficulty. To learn more about Flexible Raids, please visit our blog titled: A Raid for All Seasons: Flexible Raid Preview.  New Area: Timeless Isle  More information coming soon.  New Feature: Proving Grounds  Proving Grounds is a new feature for individual players to test and improve their combat skills. At the Proving Grounds, players may undertake trials, designed for Damage, Tank, or Healer roles. It provides a great opportunity to learn how to Tank or Heal, without the need of a group.  Each trial is available in four separate difficulties: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Endless. Harder difficulties include more difficult and varied enemies.  Endless mode allows you to test your mettle against increasingly difficult enemies. Compare your best scores to friends and guildmates!  [PTR]: Access to the Proving Grounds and more information is coming soon.  **New Feature: Virtual Realms**  Virtual Realms are sets of realms that are fused together, and will behave exactly as if they were one cohesive realm. Players on the same Virtual Realm will be able to join guilds, access a single Auction House, join arena teams and raids, as well run dungeons or group up to complete quests. Players belonging to the same Virtual Realm will have a (#) symbol next to their name.  Redesigned Arena System  Players no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete. Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the appropriate size (cross-realm groups are supported) may queue for an Arena bracket of the same size (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).  Each player will have a personal rating that increase or decrease based on victories and defeats against other rated opponents. Opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of the party.  Conquest cap, requirements on gear and enchantments will be based on the player's personal rating. The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup. Just like Rated Battlegrounds and normal Battlegrounds, all Arenas will now be region-wide!  At the end of an Arena season, the top players in a region will still earn titles and mounts. For more details about the change to Arenas, please see the blog titled: Patch 5.4 Arena Update.  The Legendary Questline Continues  More information coming soon.  **Classes**  Fears cast by players no longer increases the target's movement speed. All taunt type abilities now increase all threat generated against the target while the taunt is active by 200%.  Vengeance gains from being critically hit have been halved.

This new category applies to:  Fellash,  Gorefiend's Grasp,  Glyph of Explosive Trap,  Thunderstorm,  Typhoon,  Ursol's Vortex, and  Whiplash.   **Death Knight**  General   Icebound Fortitude no longer costs Runic Power.  **Talents**   Anti-Magic Zone has been redesigned. The talent now reduces magic damage taken in the area-of-effect by 40% for 3 seconds, and the ability no longer scales with strength.   Death Siphon had its damage increased by 10%.

If the mushroom is recast, the mushroom moves to the new location and retains its accumulated bonus healing. A single mushroom now heals for as much as what 3 mushrooms combined healed for previously.   Wrath has its mana cost increased by 50%.  **Talents**   Dream of Cenarius has been  completely redesigned to reduce complexity and increase usability, but maintain the spirit of the effects. Benefits now varies by specialization.  Balance: Increases the amount healed by  Healing Touch by 20%. Casting  Healing Touch increases the damage bonus of the Druid's next  Eclipse by 10%.

Balance: Wrath,  Starfire, and  Starsurge casts have a 8% chance to cause the next  Astral Communion to grant 100 Lunar Power or Solar Power instead of activating the next Eclipse.  Guardian: Increases Rage generation from Mangle (Bear) by 20% instead of 30%, but the bonus now also applies to Rage generated by Primal Fury.  Restoration: Now causes the Druid to gain 100% haste (up from 75%) on their next spell after casting  Swiftmend.   Ysera's Gift, a new talent healing the Druid for 5% of their maximum health every 5 seconds. If the Druid is at full health, it will heal the most injured friendly target nearby instead. This talent fills the spot vacated by  Nature's Swiftness.  **Glyphs**  New Glyph: Glyph of Efflorescence increases the healing done by Swiftmend by 20%, causes the Efflorescence healing effect to be triggered by Wild Mushroom instead of Swiftmend, and lasts as long as the Wild Mushroom is active.   Glyph of Ferocious Bite now causes Ferocious Bite to heal the Druid for 2% of their maximum health for each 10 Energy used (up from 1%).   Glyph of Innervate now causes Innervate to give both the Druid and the target 60% of the normal effect of the spell if it's cast on a target other than the Druid.

Carefully slice each square horizontally through the middle to create two thin slices. Place one or two slices of cheese on a thin slice of bread and then top with the other half of the bread square. Spread butter on both sides of each sandwich. Heat large skillet or griddle over medium heat and cook sandwiches until both sides are golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove and let cool. Cut into 1-inch pieces.   **For the soup** heat olive oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes and cook 30 seconds more. Stir in tomatoes and broth and bring to a simmer. Cook 15 minutes. Use an immersion blender to puree, or transfer to a blender or food processor. Stir in whipping cream, if using. Serve hot with croutons sprinkled over the top.

In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. &gt;This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete. &gt;  http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/50871/asked-answered-gtav.html",¬Æ

t5_2xtgm,Dannei,1373410682,"There are several aberrations introduced by any optical system - essentially, ways in which light doesn't act as it would if it were going through a perfect lens/mirror.  The most major of these for lenses is chromatic (colour) aberration - different wavelengths of light are affected differently by a lens, because of Physics‚Ñ¢. This means that your blue light will be focussed to a different location than your red light, which isn't what you want! This can be corrected for by extra lenses - but of course, you have to include corrections for *those* lenses as well! Mirrors, which are more common in astronomy, avoid this problem by having simpler Physics‚Ñ¢, and reflecting all colours of light in the same direction.  There is also spherical aberration, which also affects mirrors, which is caused by the lens/mirror being a 3D object. The edges of the lens are at a different distance from the ""model"" focal plane (where the light is focussed) than the centre of the lens (it wouldn't be a lens if this wasn't true!), and so the edges of the lens focus at a different location to the centre. However, this can be overcome by shaping your lens as a [parabola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paraboloid_of_Revolution.svg), rather than a sphere.  Lenses are also quite awkward because glass both transmits and reflects light - reflections inside your optical system aren't very nice for your image, and (probably more important for astronomy) they lose light that would otherwise be going to your image. With mirrors, you don't have to worry about the tiny bit of light that is absorbed or transmitted, because it just ""goes away""! Special coatings can be used to reduce reflection on lenses, but it's complicated to get them to work for all colours.  (Some of the other reasons mirrors are used in astronomy is that reflecting telescopes can be much shorter, mirrors are much lighter than the huge chunks of glass needed for lenses, and you can also use lots of smaller mirrors to make up a larger [segmented mirror](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Salt_mirror.jpg), which doesn't work with lenses!)",‚Ñ¢

From Rockstar:  &gt; Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game we have yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles. In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game.

What a visionary this young man had appeared to be!  His STEM degree was impressive, yes. But it was his wit, his insight, and his ability to charm them with anecdotes of the various animals he'd rescued from shelters and dumpsters that had won them over. Clearly, Mr. Thanh48 was more than a brilliant mind. *He had a heart.*  The team wanted to forget what they'd just heard, but it was impossible. The words still hung in the air: ""*I have made over 100,000 internet points.*""  This new piece of information changed everything.  A wizened gentleman leaned over his notes. His pen scraped over the page in fluid motions, leaving dark lines in its wake. He ended with a single flourish, then slid the clipboard to which it was attached across the table.  Eager hands scrambled to receive it, but a woman two seats away caught it. She read silently, the rest of the team following her eyes as they flitted across the page. They would soon learn what their esteemed colleague and founder of the company had written. For now, they played it cool while waiting their turn.  What they would see would change them forever. Mr. Clark, the man whom they'd trusted with their careers, a man who'd been their mentor, their friend, and even a father figure to many of them, had checked off several categories in his notes. It was the last box that shook them to the core:  ~~‚òë `Visionary`~~   ~~‚òë `Team Player`~~   ~~‚òë `Insightful`~~   ~~‚òë `Asset to his former employer`~~   ‚òë `Posted for Karma` - *100,000 points*",‚òë

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1373437157,"&gt;I am just saying Jesus did not go around saying that stuff.   I repeat: I strongly advise you to read that book before you go on making claims about what it does and does not say.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;""These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2rxrw,katlovescows,1373470803,"How did it come to be? I think a lot of it has had to do with the rigid policing of women's identities and bodies in our culture and our capitalism-based views of success.  I mean, consider that most women will at least fairly consistently say that *something* is wrong with their body; ""I'm too fat, I'm too tall, I'm too small-breasted (or the reverse), my skin is bad, etc ad nauseam."" And hell, even when a woman does something ""right"" (like losing weight), the process never ends. Even there we have ""I need to get rid of my stretch marks,"" or ""now I need to tone my body, or, I need a new wardrobe!""  A great deal of this is motivated by the market / consumerist culture, which relies heavily upon the notions of competition; you don't want to just keep up with the Joneses, you want them to keep up with you. But in efforts to have ever more powerful marketing, that competition transcends personal success (being fit, looking ""sexy,"" being happy and healthy etc) and begins to draw on deep seated cultural norms and threats about them. If you are not appropriately attired / fit / proportioned / flawless you will not meet the man of your dreams (and lets be honest, although the importance of finding your One True Love‚Ñ¢ is universally important in our culture, the vast majority of depictions are entirely heteronormative and with relatively culturally acceptable gender roles), you will not have your suburban house with a white picket fence, and you will not have your 2.5 kids. The obvious ""villain"" in these scenarios is another woman who has been buying more / working out harder / whatever and ""steals your man."" So this setup bleeds into commercials, television, movies, etc where it becomes a common narrative and the stereotype is born; the effort to find love itself is portrayed as a battle of consumerism as opposed to a relationship which develops between two comparable people with appropriate communication etc.  That's my thought on the issue anyway.  TL;DR: I don't believe that most women hate their friends, or even other women, I think that that is a myth perpetuated by a consumer culture which requires competition to drive consumption.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2sm9e,beav0901dm,1373472542,"MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON  Jean Arthur, James Stewart and Claude Rains star in Frank Capra's MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, the award-winning 1939 classic about an idealistic, small town senator who heads to Washington and suddenly finds himself single-handedly battling ruthless politicians out to destroy him. When Frank Capra decided to film the novel ""The Gentleman From Montana"", he ran into an obstacle Director Rouben Mamoulian owned the rights to the story. Unwilling to sell, Mamoulian eventually traded the material to Columbia on the condition that he be allowed to direct Golden Boy. As Capra began working on the film, now called MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, it was suggested that Gary Copper, the star of Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, take the lead. Capra selected Jimmy Stewart instead and the film solidified Stewart's movie career, garnering him his first Academy Award¬Æ nomination. Receiving a total of eleven 1939 Oscar¬Æ nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director), and winning one (Best Motion Picture Story), MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is considered one of Capra's, Stewart's and Columbia's finest films. It also marked the end of an era. It was Capra's final film for the studio.  MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (1936)  When a small-town idealist (Gary Cooper) goes to New York to collect a twenty million dollar inheritance, he finds romance with wisecracking journalist Jean Arthur, becomes the target of ruthless businessmen and relatives, and finally decides to give his fortune away because it's so much trouble. This milestone film is one of the most charming and best-loved romantic comedies ever made.  IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert team up for laughs as mismatched lovers in this 1934 screwball comedy classic. Spoiled Ellie Andrews (Colbert) escapes from her millionaire father (Walter Connolly), who wants to stop her from marrying a worthless playboy. En route to New York, Ellie gets involved with an out-of-work newsman, Peter Warne (Gable). When their bus breaks down, the bickering couple set off on a madcap hitchhiking expedition. Peter hopes to parlay the inside story of their misadventures into a job. But complications fly when the runaway heiress and brash reporter fall in love. Directed by Frank Capra, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT was the first movie to be honored with all five major Oscars¬Æ: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.  YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU  Lionel Barrymore is the eccentric patriarch of a clan of frustrated artists who decided 30 years earlier to retire from the rat race and use his fortune to encourage friends and family to pursue vocations that really interest them. At the center of his family is his granddaughter, Jean Arthur, who is carrying on a romance with her boss' son, James Stewart.  Academy Award¬Æ winner James Stewart (1940 Best Actor, The Philadelphia Story and 1985 Honorary Oscar¬Æ), Jean Arthur, Academy Award¬Æ winner Lionel Barrymore (1931 Best Actor, A Free Soul) and Edward Arnold star in this classic screwball comedy. Based on the phenomenally successful Kaufman-Hart play, You Can't Take It With You was directed by Frank Capra and won two Academy Awards¬Æ (1938 Best Picture, Best Director) and garnered five more nominations. It was Capra's third Oscar¬Æ for directing. Arthur stars as Alice Sycamore, the stable family member of an offbeat clan of free spirits who falls for Stewart, the down-to-earth son of a snooty, wealthy family. Amidst a backdrop of confusion, the two very different families rediscover the simple joys of life.  AMERICAN MADNESS Walter Huston stars as an idealistic bank president who has been making loans to depositors without sufficient collateral. When there's a run on his bank, his loyal staff rallies local small businessmen to make more deposits which moves the directors to keep the bank afloat. Released shortly after FDR's New Deal, this film whole-heartedly espoused Roosevelt's ideals.  One of Frank Capra‚Äôs early, lesser known films is a revelation for fans of It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Addressing some of the same themes Capra would tackle in these classic films, in his own inimitable style, he again focuses on American history and the character of the small town hero. Bank president Thomas Dickson (Walter Huston, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre) battles his board of directors in order to keep making loans to his hard-pressed clientele. When dire circumstances threaten the bank‚Äôs solvency, chief teller Matt Brown (Pat O‚ÄôBrien, Some Like it Hot, Angels with Dirty Faces) and his fianc√©e (Constance Cummings, Blithe Spirit) rally around the boss, but will it be too little too late?

t5_2qh7f,gregcain,1373473981,"I've got a FoodSaver¬Æ V2222 Vacuum Sealer, which I paid about $24 for. It's my second FoodSaver, and I love it (the first was working great when we got rid of it - long story.)    Also - I think Costco has the v3880 or one that looks a lot like it for quite a bit cheaper than $175.  I use it for all of the things you mention, and I think the Sous Vide makes it even more useful.  Buy Pork in bulk at Costco, seal an appropriate serving size and freeze.  When it's time, take the bag out of the freezer and put it directly in the Sous Vide.  Come home, and dinner is ready.  Delicious and easy.    For jars, I think you MUST get the jar attachment, and don't think of jars as just temporarily packing things.  They're a great replacement for many of the things you'd use a bag for.  We put frozen vegetables, mashed potatoes, and more in our.  Great for future lunches.  If you vacuseal and then freeze, I think you can get quite a bit more life out of what's in your jars.  I try to make lunches on Sunday, then seal them just so they're a bit more fresh come Friday.  Does it work?  I think so.  Does it hurt anything?  Not that I know of.    My recommendations - don't spend that much money, but buy the jar attachment.   Jars, Vacuseal'ing and Sous Vide are the holy trinity of easy, cheap home cooking.    Enjoy!!",¬Æ

And I agree with you that the guy clearly is not very familiar with git, and that is the source of the bulk of his comment.  But the guy's point is that it's not a comfortable transition from svn (which is a real thing) and that the experience sucks on Windows.  Yes, it's awesome on Linux; git was polished by a bunch of Linux hackers who love the command line and made it a thing of beauty there.  But cygwin is a facimile of Unix on Windows.  It's not tremendously friendly to someone who is trying to do things the Microsoft Way‚Ñ¢.  If someone said ""Visual SourceSafe in WINE works fine on Linux...it looks just like Windows"", you'd probably object to using VSS (even aside from the fact that the product was a stinking pile of junk).

Meanwhile, a horridly obese man emerged from the forest in full Klan regalia, waving goodbye to his fellow Tea-Party racist republican NRA members after another rally to promote rape culture against womyn and minorities. ""Great meeting, you guys!"" he shouted as he waved behind him. The man removed his Klan hood to reveal the hideous face of none other than George Zimmerman; his blond hair, pale white skin, and swastika tattoo in prominent display.  Suddenly, the evil tiny-dicked white NRA racist spotted innocent Trayvon playing with the happy animals in a scene reminiscent of Bambi. Enraged, the racist Zimmerman phoned the police. ""BIPPITY BAPPITY YIPPITY YAPPITY YEAHAAWW TARNATION Y'ALL DE'RES A GODDAMN NIGGER IN THESE PARTS"" he screeched at the operator while waving his Confederate flag. ""I'M GONNA SHOOT ME A GODDAMN COON SKINNED NIGGER""  ""No, please, don't do that you racist!"" the 911 operator cried! ""I am giving you a legally binding directive not to leave your gas-guzzling global warming causing rapist car with confederate flag and Romney 2012 bumperstickers! Spare that sweet, innocent little boy!""  But the racist small dicked white NRA member Zimmerman had no mercy in his heart when he murdered poor baby toddler like jolly Trayvon with his tiny-dicked compensation assault pistol. Flashes of MLK Jr and a thousand slaves being whipped flashed through Trayvon's mind to the chorus of angel choir as he ascended into heaven, while Zimmerman and the racist cracka ass police danced around Trayvon's corpse firing guns into the air like Yosemite Sam.

If you can install proprietary drivers, odds are you can sort out that issue as well.  2. As someone else said, I've never run into this as an issue  3. easily solvable, if a problem at all.  Anyone who can navigate a Windoze menu and click a few buttons can navigate to a terminal and right-click paste.  4. I use xfce4 and have none of these issues.  I do agree that Unity blows ass, but that's why there are options!  5.  Yea...so this one I'll give you.  But there is the other side of the argument, that fragmentation can be okay.  Mir vs Wayland I think will be the *biggest* of these issues for a developer, but none of these are really that big of issues for an end-user, especially someone using Ubuntu LTS.  6. I agree that Software Center is slow, but...come on man, Windoze et al don't even *have* a comparable thing that I know of!  You have to go to a software vendor's website to download, say, Chrome or Skype.  I haven't had the other issues you speak of though.

Honestly though, at the end of the day, anyone who uses OS X or Windoze should hope that Linux gets a bigger market share.

In theory both jokes would be equally bad but the problem is the very double standard that you MRAs whine about. Except it‚Äôs a real, actual double standard of the treatment of women vs men. I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with MRAs if they didn‚Äôt shit on women while making arguments for men‚Äôs rights. I‚Äôm a man. Why the hell would I not like more rights? I like rights. Everyone does.

Most of the posts in the thread you are referencing were helpful.  &gt;Come on, I don't see the point of using exaggerative language when trying to make a realistic point.  Get over yourself, I wasn't  exaggerating, I see posts often griping about how hard it is for college graduates to find decent full time employment these days - and they're right. Unless you are on the reddit‚Ñ¢ engineering hurr durr bandwagon, a certain subsection of  dumb-asses will blame your choice of major.  &gt;That being said, I think I get the general point you're making, but I still think it's flawed -- I think you're saying that Redditors would find ways to be equally pessimistic about the job prospects of every major they're presented with, but this just isn't true.  Nope, close but that wasn't actually my point. My point was it's hard for everyone nowadays, new graduates triply so. Every Major. Every field. Graduate work, education, white collar, blue collar, the economy sucks and any job is hard to get into right now.  &gt;Someone said something similar to you, so I'll just paste what I wrote in reply:  Blah blah blah...whatever...look - I'm not encouraging anyone to go to school not caring about their major or not wanting to work in that field. I'm just saying it happens, much more often than you seem to think. Hell, sometimes people start in their field hate it and find something connected  but different to transfer over to. Would you consider that a waste of schooling too?   &gt;From what I've seen, by the way, Cartography involves the students actually learning applicable skills with computers that will make them likely more employable than most History majors.  Are you fucking kidding me? I will be the first to admit I don't know about cartography and was just making a arrested development reference (you know, how useless it is to study the exploration and mapping of new lands, given how the entire globe is mapped).   Do you seriously think there are better employment opportunities for cartographers as compared to historians? Or is this just part of your need to get the last word in and ""win"" i'n every disagreement you have? Lots of people in this thread have given you really good advice and life experience, compassionate and understanding people and you have just shit on their responses and circled the argument back to your strawman concerns. You keep referencing this one girl that is a Russian language major and compare this ONE individual to your history major boyfriend! How are these even connected?!  I don't think you want real world advice from people with life experience, I think you you wan't thoughtless agreement with whatever little though happens to occupy your head. Literally everyone in this thread has disagreed with you to a point, either from a practical standpoint or a simple emotional/relationship level. You just circle back to your self adsorbed shit points about how you're right and everyone is wrong, and using one fucking Reddit thread as proof.  So I'm gonna give you some advice that seriously is worth thinking about, I'm not ripping on you this is true for anyone entering school: you are putting an awful lot of your mental and emotional energy over a tiny issues with a guy that might not even be your boyfriend a year from now.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh61,SilverSnakes88,1373516900,"Saccharin  Studies in laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked saccharin with the development of bladder cancer. For this reason, Congress mandated that further studies of saccharin be performed and required that all food containing saccharin bear the following warning label: ‚ÄúUse of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.‚Äù  Subsequent studies in rats showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder cancer at high doses of saccharin, especially in male rats. However, mechanistic studies (studies that examine how a substance works in the body) have shown that these results apply only to rats. Human epidemiology studies (studies of patterns, causes, and control of diseases in groups of people) have shown no consistent evidence that saccharin is associated with bladder cancer incidence.  Because the bladder tumors seen in rats are due to a mechanism not relevant to humans and because there is no clear evidence that saccharin causes cancer in humans, saccharin was delisted in 2000 from the U.S. National Toxicology Program‚Äôs Report on Carcinogens, where it had been listed since 1981 as a substance reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen (a substance known to cause cancer). More information about the delisting of saccharin is available at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/append/appb.pdf on the Internet. The delisting led to legislation, which was signed into law on December 21, 2000, repealing the warning label requirement for products containing saccharin.  Aspartame  Aspartame, distributed under several trade names (e.g., NutraSweet¬Æ and Equal¬Æ), was approved in 1981 by the FDA after numerous tests showed that it did not cause cancer or other adverse effects in laboratory animals. Questions regarding the safety of aspartame were renewed by a 1996 report suggesting that an increase in the number of people with brain tumors between 1975 and 1992 might be associated with the introduction and use of this sweetener in the United States. However, an analysis of then-current NCI statistics showed that the overall incidence of brain and central nervous system cancers began to rise in 1973, 8 years prior to the approval of aspartame, and continued to rise until 1985. Moreover, increases in overall brain cancer incidence occurred primarily in people age 70 and older, a group that was not exposed to the highest doses of aspartame since its introduction. These data do not establish a clear link between the consumption of aspartame and the development of brain tumors.  In 2005, a laboratory study found more lymphomas and leukemias in rats fed very high doses of aspartame (equivalent to drinking 8 to 2,083 cans of diet soda daily) (1). However, there were some inconsistencies in the findings. For example, the number of cancer cases did not rise with increasing amounts of aspartame as would be expected. An FDA statement on this study can be found at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108650.htm on the Internet.  Subsequently, NCI examined human data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study of over half a million retirees. Increasing consumption of aspartame-containing beverages was not associated with the development of lymphoma, leukemia, or brain cancer (2).  Acesulfame potassium, Sucralose, and Neotame  In addition to saccharin and aspartame, three other artificial sweeteners are currently permitted for use in food in the United States:  Acesulfame potassium (also known as ACK, Sweet One¬Æ, and Sunett¬Æ) was approved by the FDA in 1988 for use in specific food and beverage categories, and was later approved as a general purpose sweetener (except in meat and poultry) in 2002. Sucralose (also known as Splenda¬Æ) was approved by the FDA as a tabletop sweetener in 1998, followed by approval as a general purpose sweetener in 1999. Neotame, which is similar to aspartame, was approved by the FDA as a general purpose sweetener (except in meat and poultry) in 2002. Before approving these sweeteners, the FDA reviewed more than 100 safety studies that were conducted on each sweetener, including studies to assess cancer risk. The results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or pose any other threat to human health.  Cyclamate  Because the findings in rats suggested that cyclamate might increase the risk of bladder cancer in humans, the FDA banned the use of cyclamate in 1969. After reexamination of cyclamate‚Äôs carcinogenicity and the evaluation of additional data, scientists concluded that cyclamate was not a carcinogen or a co-carcinogen (a substance that enhances the effect of a cancer-causing substance). A food additive petition was filed with the FDA for the reapproval of cyclamate, but this petition is currently being held in abeyance (not actively being considered). The FDA‚Äôs concerns about cyclamate are not cancer related.",¬Æ

(Freeway just kinda stood on the side and cosigned but wateva)  Hologram biggie came through again of course and he rapped along with Jay-Z everytime they said the same lines.  Lebron has some crazy adlibs and throws powder around (Beans looks upset... he had the bakin soda ready) Drake comes up with the next YOLO and makes a basketball reference during the hook, they sell a million singles and get a deal for the NBA halftime song.    Later that night Bron Bron wins game 7, and Jay-Z performs the new song in the sold out Barclays center, a record 24 times.  The Nets get a ring and Jay-Z makes it to a $billy$  ",‚Ñ¢

Trust me when I say that you don't really want to wait until every single bug is fixed. But at the same time you don't really want someone forcing a date like this.  2.) The submission process itself. When a game is released to a platform it has to undergo a submission and approval process by the platform provider. These Submissions have a scale they measure bug severity by, the problem is it will in no way line up with how the consumer would decide what is important to be fixed. All the textures on Hats flicker when creating a character. Minor visual issue that isn't even taken into account during submission. That error prompt said ""Press down on the d-pad to un-equip weapons"". Instant rejection due to not using the approved naming convention ""Multiforce¬Æ Directional Button Group"".

They're quite compressed, and use interframe compression. Trust me, that is a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢.  &gt; the render times are long and the file sizes are actually increased  Because you're demuxing from MPEG streams never meant for editing, and you're likely exporting to a higher quality codec (which I highly recommend). If you're going to do this right, you're going to have to deal with large files.   &gt; MediaConverter supports H.264 encoding but that, too, is a long render and the quality of the video kind of goes to shit  Rendering takes a long time because H.264 (AKA: AVC) is a highly compressed, mathematically complex codec, which chews up a lot of CPU power just reading it. Then you're manipulating the video, and re-encoding it. That 's no small task you're asking of you machine.  Your quality is going to hell because your render/export codec is probably a low bitrate H.264. You'll probably want to change that.  &gt; I'm looking for a way to either import straight into either editing suite  You can try remuxing your video from MKV to MP4 using ffmpeg and telling it to pass through the video, but you might have to transcode the ~~video~~ audio.

t5_2r2u0,Tom2Die,1373607315,"So I tried a bot game, just by myself with other bots because I haven't played Dota 2 before and never played DotA (though I play LoL a ton) and I must say...  holy shitballs can I not figure anything out in the interface.  I understand that complexity is amazing, and that long time players of the game probably come to love the interface, but it was absurdly confusing.  And like I said, I play a *ton* of LoL.  I couldn't even figure out how to recall to the fountain, or whether there even is a similar mechanic in Dota 2.  I assume there is, as I assume that LoL borrowed it from DotA and that Dota 2 is fairly true to the original, but...wow.  I kinda wanted to give this game the ol' college try, especially since it's native Linux and the framerate was amazing with better graphics quality than when I run LoL on wine, but...I can't do it.  Let me know if I missed the tutorial, but if I did it's because the main interface is also quite cluttered.  It was hard enough even realizing that I could make a private game with just myself and bots.  Thanks Valve for moving All The Things‚Ñ¢ to Linux, but this is one game that, at least for now, I can't get behind at all.   (edit: after reading a bit on the interwebs, I've learned that to recall you need a town portal scroll, and that you can actually deselect your hero by selecting someone else, thereby relinquishing your control over your character until you select him again (I guess F1 does that).

t5_2rj3j,heb0,1373608578,"&gt;OXFORD, Miss. The Lafayette County Prosecutor's Office has confirmed reports that a 20-year-old African American male by the name of Porfiry Jagannatha Hairston was present in the vehicle of Ole Miss shooting guard Marshall Henderson on the night of his arrest.  &gt;While Henderson attended a May 15 court date for his run-in, which included the discovery of small amounts of marijuana and cocaine in his vehicle, Hairston is said to have been carrying on his person several grams of methamphetamines, twenty-three hours of digital video depicting the entire UNC basketball team planning to engage in insider trading and serial murder, an ICBM, and a My Little Pony‚Ñ¢ Playset.  &gt;While requests to speak with the arresting officer, identified in police reports as Officer Hayden ""Thins"" Thomas, were not answered by Oxford Police, the department did release a statement saying they are considering all the evidence and cannot speak further on the case.  &gt;Late Thursday evening, the NCAA Compliance office released a statement verifying that the NCAA plans to launch an investigation into Ole Miss' involvement in Harrison's Arrest, which a spokesperson described as ""a travesty resulting from a history of tacit approval of behavior that undermines the responsibilities required of the student-athlete.""  &gt;The NCAA recently has been criticized for alleged mishandling of investigations into high-profile athletic programs at the University of Miami and Grambling State University, but the compliance office confirmed that they will bring ""swift and merciless justice"" for this violation.  &gt;An NCAA employee who asked not to be named verified rumors that the organization was currently working with the Obama Administration to launch retaliatory drone strikes against Ole Miss and the entire state of Mississippi, which the President in the past has identified as a terrorist state and really just a terrible place in general.  &gt;When pressed to comment on Hairston's possible involvement in the May 4 arrest and what if any connection the event might have with UNC, the NCAA source said that Hairston will likely receive a three-game suspension and no dessert for a week.  &gt;This is not Henderson's first run-in with the law. In September of 2011 he was cited for drunk and disorderly conduct and aggravated emotional assault when he stripped naked in a Lafeyette County Walmart and smeared engine oil on his arms and torso while screaming gibberish.  &gt;In TMZ video released Wednesday said to depict Henderson's most recent arrest, a blurred Henderson can be seen being helped into an Oxford police cruiser. In the 15-second video, Henderson is heard telling officers that he ""wont let them steal his thoughts"" and that ""Jews are responsible for all the world's wars.""

t5_2qi0a,wadcann,1373613187,"&gt; Without a doubt you cannot, period.  You likely legally can, but that you stand some substantial risk of being sued, whether-or-not the company has any legitimate grounds for doing so.  [My regular post, yet again](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11v69k/using_a_guns_name_in_your_video_game/c6q00vq):  &gt; I'm not a lawyer, but: &gt;  &gt; [Using the Trademarks of Others](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others): &gt;  &gt; &gt;* Nominative Fair Use: The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(c)(3)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims. Some examples of nominative fair use include a newspaper's use of the ""New Kids on the Block"" trademark to create and report on polls asking readers questions about the musical group's popularity; another newspaper's use of the trademark ""Boston Marathon"" in order to report on the sporting event; and a photographer's use of ""Barbie"" dolls in parody photographs that criticized Mattel's famous toy and the values she represents. Another example from our database is law blogger Eric Turkewitz's use of the Avis and Hertz logos in a blog post about a lawsuit involving these two companies. (Note, however, that there is some question about whether using a logo, rather than just a textual reference, would qualify as a fair use under the three-part test outlined above.) &gt;  &gt; also: &gt;  &gt; &gt;First Amendment Defenses: Courts have recognized a number of additional ""First Amendment"" defenses in particular situations. For example, in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a filmmaker could use Ginger Rogers' trademark (her name) in the title of a film called ""Ginger and Fred,"" even though the film was not primarily about Rogers. The court indicated that trademark law should be applied to artistic works ""only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" The specific details of these defenses is beyond the scope of this guide; the point to keep in mind is that courts may act to protect your right of free expression even if what you are doing doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories above. &gt;  &gt; My own view, which is not informed by any specific case history and is not that of a lawyer, is that it's probably fine. &gt;  &gt; At the end of the day, trademarked products are part of our society and culture.  The point of a trademark isn't to keep you from *talking* about something, but to keep you from *misrepresenting* yourself as being the creator of a production.  Avoiding misrepresentation is essential to permit building reputation.  Building reputation is important for our markets to function, for people to be able to choose to purchase products from someone who they have been happy with in the past. &gt;  &gt; If it's illegal for someone else to sell cereal under the name ""Wheaties"", as trademark law provides, then people can build up reputation associated with those Wheaties and know that, for example, cereal sold as ""Wheaties"" means that a product is of high quality and is satisfactory. &gt;  &gt; But that doesn't mean that you can't write a book or have a reality TV show or so forth in which the main character eats Wheaties for breakfast.  It's obvious there that the reality TV show isn't part of the Wheaties product line. &gt;  &gt; Now, all that being said, there should also be no possibility of confusion that the owner of the trademark is endorsing your own product.  A standard legal CYA (probably not necessary for the use you're making, but strengthens a legal position by providing an argument) may be to include the boilerplate stuff that you [may have seen on ads or other things that reference trademarks of someone else](http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/fair-play/): &gt;  &gt; &gt; ""LEGO¬Æis a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site"".  &gt;  &gt; I probably wouldn't list the ""Colt Bushmaster"" on the packaging or wherever where you don't want to make that disclaimer available without a purchase; again probably not a hard requirement, but strengthens your legal position.  And I would not use the Colt logo in the description, but simply the text.  You're simply describing a real-world gun to the user, and you need to use the text to make it clear which you are talking about. &gt;  &gt; The only minor point of confusion ‚Äî and I'm not familiar with the case law here ‚Äî is that there *are* license games that *do* specifically enjoy being able to claim that they are endorsed by the licensee, especially sports games and (closer to this) driving games, to the point that driving games routinely *do* license the car.  Whether-or-not requiring driving licenses would hold up in court, Ferrari *has* C&amp;Ded game creators who [don't have licenses](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/2115416771.shtml).  Note that Ferrari can claim whatever they want; just because Ferrari does this doesn't mean that they would prevail in a lawsuit.  But I suspect that most people don't want to hassle with Ferrari on the point of a lawsuit. &gt;  &gt; There have been numerous commercial games in the past, like *Jagged Alliance 2*, which have referenced many weapons, and I strongly doubt that they went out to gun manufacturers and tried to get licenses. &gt;  &gt; EDIT: Please note that I am referring to law in the United States.  If you're dealing with some different jurisdiction, I've no idea how closely things run to the US. ",¬Æ
t5_2qhcm,aim2free,1373613288,"&gt; The BSD license is keeping humanity down?  The problem with the BSD license is that such code can be mixed with proprietary code.  &gt; That is 100% absurd. I don't like the GPL and never have.   If you had been aware about this ridiculous dystopic world we are living in, do I need to say things like e.g. Microsoft, Nvidia, Cisco with likely backdoors, firmware binary blobs, etc? Then you would have another opinion.  &gt; Your point about the ""industry"" only having a short time left is almost as absurd too.  It depends upon what you mean by short. They won't dissappear this year, but would hardly no longer exist within 20 years. However, the ""industry"" I'm speaking about is that stupid industry built around _proprietary_ software and technology. One of the worst beasts here [are now transforming](http://m.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/a-new-microsoft-major-reorganization-puts-focus-on-hardware-services/2013/07/11/0ade06a8-ea21-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html?wpisrc=nl_tech_b), they will soon be considerable less harmful regarding software, but... unless they chose another track than their net gadgeteer (open hw) they have to die.  You see, most industries, are not based upon proprietary software or technology. Industries manufacture things. However during long time these manufacturing industries have been abused by a few manipulators, which have abused all kinds of sanity regarding giving what people want (which is all what real industries actually want) and secret codes and patents, which has caused a chaotic and unnecessary stand still for the industry.  &gt; Your future is a horrible vision where people don't have a choice unless it is yours.  LOL, ROTFLOL :D :D :D :D      If you just had stopped before this sentence, then you could still be any somewhat misled developer, but when you added that stupid insane crazy sentence then you revealed yourself. You are a NOBODY, you are a mental prostitute, you are selling your valuable mind to someone else. You are a stupid shill or an astroturfer.   If your LOL-inducing last sentence is not deliberately said just to show your crazyness or your frustration, then I can explain it to you, be my guest‚ù£  You speak about choice... Today people do not have choices‚ù¢ They are locked in manipulated slaves‚ù¢ They are not independent‚ù¢ They have no free will‚ù¢  They are being told what to buy, what to think, what to do‚ù¢ They can not create, invent or freely communicate ideas‚ù¢  If you had something inside your skull you would understand that the problem is not BSD vs GPL vs younameit. The problem is that there exists proprietary software, as well as lots of software with incompatible licenses, that is they can not be mixed‚ù¢ This implies that people do not have choices‚ù¢  Regarding choices I think you should read my essay on what happens when we release ideas [Evolution, Deception and Cooking‚ù¢](http://rolandorre.se/?p=175 ""Warning, it's provocative!"") and it may also be intersting to read my entry about [Love as a universal concept](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15 ""All You Need Is Love!""). In the latter I actually take BSD vs GPL as examples of unconditional love vs mutual love. One could reason so that if there were no evil proprietary code, then it would be sufficient with BSD, but it's also about temptation (which I didn't write). If ""public domain"" would not be GPL then someone sometime could be tempted to release their code as a secret black box, thus enslaving other people which then become dependent and unfree, and our ""friend"" Microsoft _(here as a metaphor for **evil**)_ is back... We certainly do not want this to happen‚ù£",‚ù£

t5_2qy22,Daemonixx,1373632061,"Gargoyle geckos are some of the most hand able geckos you can find on the market, and are quite easy to maintain. Since he is still only about a month old I use a paper towel as a substrate and provide lots of hiding places with plants for him to go into. I provide a heavy mist twice a day, once in the morning (7:15ish am) and once in the evening (8:30ish pm) and this keeps him quite happy. I am using the Crested Gecko Repashy diet as it provides all the nutrients and vitamins that he needs. I will eventually provide calcium dusted crickets but he is still to young. Although they make great pets they are quite expensive to purchase, the gecko goes anywhere from 100-200$ and that's the gecko alone. Then all of the other stuff really depends on how much you wish to spend on it. I would highly recommend it as a pet as he is adorable, easily maintained, and very docile. But they are nocturnal so they become fired down over the day an dont move unless provoked, but become very active at night. So if you want something which you can watch run around during the day I would go with the Leo. Hope this helped üòÑ",üòÑ

Nope.  &gt; We really have no idea what we are doing here and religion is only more beautiful than some of the scientific jargon.  I find scientific discovery more beautiful than all the houses of worship put together.   &gt; You have to be very humble to be an atheist and admit you just don't know anything. Don't pretend as if you know why the Universe is here. Don't allow the cosmos to be smaller than the Earth.  We know *some* things. We don't know everything, and the only people i've met who have such a certainty about knowing THE TRUTH¬© are the religious.   &gt; I am personally liberated and scared shitless knowing that humans really have absolutely no idea what we are doing here.  We're existing. Same as that plant over there, the microbes in the air, and the proteins in that pond scum.  &gt; We evolved. That's satisfies a me a tiny bit, but it isn't saying all that much and isn't observable, and probably all not that important since a life is never long enough to experience it.  That we know it's happening is pretty gratifying.   &gt; But what about the Universe being here. We have no idea why we exist. No idea.   We don't require a reason for our existence.  &gt; We have no idea what our purpose is or what we should be doing with our lives.   We make our own purpose.  &gt; The only thing I can say we should be doing is reproducing and satisfying any natural urges.  There are 7 billion of us and rising. We should actually dampen that.

I ask, to get a feel for your position on other matters, that some call war crimes, or illegal actions.   &gt;...there were no WMD...  I never suggested that there was, or that it was a sufficient reason to invade.  &gt;Iraq was not a threat to the US or the region.  I'm sure you are aware of people claiming that the ""WMDs were moved, before the war"", and/or the ""Saddam would have continued his work (on nuclear ambitions) after sanctions lessened"". I do not debate this topic much, so if you be so kind as to give a rebuttal for those particular claims, only if you want. I am curious.   &gt;So right there any attempt at justification is a non-starter.

(Often, your argument would be dismissed alone for lack of civility, even if your opponent doesn't show the same recourse or knowledge. Cause, really there are some that think that it was a justified reason to invade, even if they are wrong. Which I freely admit, I very well could be, but I do not believe that WMDs were there, or that Iraq posed a threat to the US or the West in of as so much to it's own people. More on that below.)  &gt;Maybe but the exact opposite of that has happened, today alone: 24 Shias killed in Iraq bombings[1]  And sectarian violence did not occur before, or that it was thought that the invasion was going to stop faith based violence? Surely, I mourn for the loss of life, that should have been preventable, but so long as there are sects of differing ideologies or faith and which ones are the ""Absolute Truth‚Ñ¢"", there will be this kind of monster to rear it's ugly, ancient head. I do understand that Saddam (tried to) suppress these kind of things.  &gt;The invasion and occupation of Iraq was easily the most monstrous of foreign policy blunders in modern American history. It makes Vietnam look like D-Day.  Not much to argue here, I agree. There were other ways to go about it, as it had nothing to do with 9/11, and it seems that Bush Jr. was trying to one-up his father. Saddam was still violated human rights and various other accords, used chemical weapons against the Kurds and Iranians, brutal suppression, lack of freedom etc. ad nauseum... What should have been the proper recourse for that situation, if any at all?   &gt;Whatever problem its apologists suggest it solved it created far more.  Is evidence of this, the social and political unrest as a result of a transitional government, and continued sectarian hatred? (As opposed to the *situation-normal-totalitarian-oppression*?) I'll admit this is not an easy one to answer, at least for me.  &gt;And what's worse is there were endless people from the UN to writers and experts who warned that it was a mistake and that there were not WMD and people like Hitchens helped shout them down.  Yes, all of them were shouted down, and there was no debate before hand, just blind action. The only debate that strictly involved the Iraq invasion and Hitchens was [Hitchens vs Galloway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLKQGwVkczg). I didn't find Galloway to be entirely persuasive.  With all my admissions, I have opened myself to be proven wrong. I welcome it, if  that be the case, however I do not appreciate being talked down to from your 'high horse', instead show me why there is a 'high horse'. I see the ethics of the invasion as being muddled. (If it wasn't your intent to talk down, so be it, it came off that why through the text.) I trust you know what I mean, it is likely you were in a position where someone thought you morally inferior, and disliked every moment of it.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2s4k5,SamRHughes,1373653923,"15-17"" IPS might not be possible.  The workstation laptops with IPS screen options are expensive.  Maybe that will change once more Haswell models come out in the fall (since IPS screens are becoming more ubiquitous), but even if it did, it would probably be low gamut IPS options (as in, a respectable 70-80% gamut screen), instead of the high-gamut and expensive Ultrasharp or DreamColor screens seen on Dell Precision and HP Elitebook Workstation models.  Probably your best option right now is the Dell Precision M4700.  You can max out the GPU to a Quadro K2000M (actually the AMD FirePro M4000 option might be better?  they seem rather close on the Mobile Graphics Comparison Chart linked on the right, maybe the question is NVIDIA vs. AMD moreso than benchmarks), get an i7-3740QM CPU, and a ""UltraSharp‚Ñ¢ FHD (1920x1080) Wide View Anti-Glare, Premium Panel Guarantee"" for $1437 when customizing up from the base model.  (That's with 2 GB of RAM.  Enjoy!)  That has 4 RAM slots for upgradeability up to 32 GB.  I don't know what that ""Wide View Anti-Glare"" panel is but I don't think it's an IPS panel.  Notebookcheck's review of the model reviews the lower-end 1920x1080 panel, and hints that the high end one has RGB LEDs and high color gamut -- I'd speculate that it's the same 95% NTSC gamut spec screen you see on the Thinkpad T530, W530, and Clevo laptops, but I don't really know, that's just speculation.",‚Ñ¢

He believed it was more honorable to learn how to do these things yourself that to become infantile and in need of constant assistance from others to just to get by.  Over-specialization of labor makes people more dependent, and makes the economy more fragile. Since people rely on corporations and tradesmen to fulfill their every need, they become completely dependent on a stable economy. It wasn't always like that. There used to be people who could get by just fine whether the economy was in the shitter or not.

You act as though ""gaining converts"" is everyone's goal, and the mission statement of the sub in general. It's not. Or at least, it *wasn't,* until the ToR marketing geniuses decided to renovate the circus into a kinder, gentler reception lobby for atheism. If you're not a clone of the Friendly Atheist, *just go away, you! And you kids, out of the pool! We don't want your kind here!* Yeah, because we won't be needing any atheists from the younger generations, we've filled the quota from the twentysomethings, we're good to go. Be careful what you wish for, newly minted mature adults, these kids coming up will be changing your diapers when you're in nursing homes. Good thing I'll be long dead by then. :D  Just because someone participated in the old sub doesn't mean they were trying to convert *anyone*, and to say that's the only valid reason for *any* participation is singularly myopic. There are lots of ways to arrive at the conclusion that atheism is the only stance on religion that makes sense, if that's your goal. A steady diet of Patheos blogs and Matt Dillahunty videos is just one. Sometimes a simpler message is what a person needs to see an obvious truth, sometimes it's an in-depth analysis. Neither approach is more ""valid"" than the other, and I would have thought that so-called skeptics would recognize that. And I would have thought a skeptic would have embraced a democratic, user-led community, rather than a top-down approach, but clearly I am 0 for 2 here.  My own road to atheism was no-muss, no-fuss. I just read the Bible when I was a little girl, and quickly realized that it sounded just like the Greek mythology I was also reading, whose gods were dismissed as myth. It was easy to dismiss the Bible as myth too, since the deities were vengeful, stupid and overtly evil in both narratives. Besides, Barbies were more fun.   And let the record show that I'm not twelve years old, nor have a been for many decades, so you'll have to trot out some other convenient dismissive disparagement for me. What does the wizened old crone know, anyway?  ETA: Don't have a legit argument? Just laugh and point! People will assume you have a legit argument. What do they call that? The ridicule fallacy?   Also, if you guys wouldn't downvote me to hell because I'm not part of your circlejerk, I'd be able to respond to all your comments in a more timely manner. Or, you could just not respond. But do whatever you want, I know It's All About The Drama‚Ñ¢ for you guys. And I even capitalized that, for extra drama. I'm a *giver.*",‚Ñ¢
t5_2ss5b,Silloe,1373676614,"Good plan, don't address anything, just change the while claiming it is the topic. Good pacing, my friend - did you take some racist apologist courses or toast masters for white supremacists?  Also, I admire your approach to such difficult situations like racism. Close the blinds until it goes away. I've heard that worked quite well for folks with crosses burning on their lawns, and I assure you that we as a society have come this far by ignoring the problem. I'm not even sure why the ACLU exists. Kinda dumb if you ask me.  Right, back on ""topic"" - my definition... I guess it'd be a bit of a cop out to use any of the many out there [1](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spearchucker) [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs#S) [3](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spear%20chucker) [4](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spearchucker) [5](http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/Spearchucker) [6](http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/s.htm) etc.  Spear chucker alludes to primitive, classless, or savage behavior, and attempts to single out black people. It's used as a contrast for racists to prop themselves up as more developed, higher, civilized, or better. It's meant to be disrespectful and degrading.  Again, I completely agree with you. Like, just yesterday I was craving a Slurpee, so I rang up the Dune Coon taxi service, and when he pulled up, I told the camel jockey, ""Hey, Towelhead, take me to Ching Chong Charlie's for a slurpee."" I went in, got some Iced Sambo Juice - that's grape slushy if you were wondering - and brought it up to the Chink's counter, unfortunately I was a bit short, so I asked the Chug behind me in line ""Hey, Injun, spare a buck?"", which he gladly obliged. Anyway, I got home and told my Uncle Tom ""Bluegum, ya mind putting my slurpee away for later?"", and he happily agreed.  The point is, nobody had a problem with any of this.  ### ‚ò∫  ### ‚òª",‚ò∫

That motherboard actually has pretty decent embedded (on board) audio. Please note, unless you plug your headset into one of the ports that is **on the audio card** (which indirectly includes the front panel once connected as above) you will not be getting audio that has been processed by the card. Using USB connections will use audio processed by the board's on board Realtek¬Æ ALC892 8-Channel High Definition Audio CODEC, unless you configure the software that came with the card to override that.

Lower production cows live longer than high production cows, but may be less profitable. Cows no longer wanted for milk production are sent to slaughter. Their meat is of relatively low value and is generally used for processed meat.  &gt; [...]  &gt; Dairy cows may continue to be economically productive for many lactations. In most cases, 10 lactations are possible. [...] the average herd life of US Holstein is today fewer than 3 lactations.   Moreover, production of male calves is the integral part of dairy production, and of course they are slaughtered too.  &gt; Dairy operations therefore include both the production of milk and the production of calves. Bull calves are either castrated and raised as steers for beef production or veal.  That's why vegans think that consumption of dairy products is ethically wrong, and do not eat products like cheese or milk. The more you know. ‚ôí‚òÜ",‚ôí

Your best bet is for you (or someone who plays and knows guitar) to show up with a tuner and keep trying out different guitars until you find the winner: yank on the strings, do some bends, use the tremolo, and then check all your chords to see if they still sound in tune (especially around the nut).

Announces Newly Formed Stem Cell Subsidiary -- Regen BioPharma Inc., Secures $20,000,000 in Institutional Funding¬† Southridge Partners to Provide $20 Million in Funding for the Rapid Commercialization of Stem Cell Therapies¬† SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwire - Apr 30, 2012) - Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (OTCQB: BMSN) (PINKSHEETS: BMSN) announced today it has formed a new subsidiary, Regen BioPharma, Inc. Regen BioPharma has developed a vertically-integrated structure for acquiring patents, performing accelerating preclinical and clinical development, and licensing or selling technology developed to large pharma companies in the area of stem cells.¬† To date, Regen BioPharma has reviewed more than 20,000 US issued patents covering stem cell related subject matter, created a shortlist of 30 promising technologies for rapid commercialization, and currently is in negotiations to license several of these. Once the technology is secured, the Company anticipates partnering with industry leading scientists, physicians, and service providers to complete the Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling work and begin clinical trials.¬† ""In biotechnology in general, and specifically in the area of regenerative medicine, the biggest value creation occurs for shareholders when a company files an IND and obtains human data that provides proof of safety and efficacy,"" said David R. Koos, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Matrix. ""We are assembling the team and capabilities to in-license and evaluate technologies rapidly, then to develop the regulatory package and initiate clinical trials. Our business model and partnerships will allow us to take cell therapy products from discovery to FDA Phase II clinical trials in as short a period as 18 - 24 months.""¬† The Company also announced that it has secured $20,000,000 in financing from Southridge Partners II, LP of Ridgefield, Connecticut.¬† This agreement grants the Company the option to sell and obligates Southridge to purchase up to $20,000,000 of common stock over its term. The per share price will be determined based on market prices in accordance with an agreed upon formula and the Company is not obligated to draw on the facility.¬† The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register the resale by Southridge of any shares issued to it under the agreement. Subject to the effectiveness of the registration statement and the satisfaction of other customary conditions, the Company may draw on the facility from time to time, as and when it determines appropriate, in accordance with the timing and volume provisions set forth in the agreement.¬†   *Valuation once both Clinical Trials have been initiated:*¬†  *These prices do not include hype for mergers, acquisitions, deals, etc‚Ä¶*¬†  Outstanding Shares= 2Billion¬† Drug in Phase 1= 40 million USD¬†  $80,000,000 market cap / 2,000,000,000 shares =¬† *.04 by the end of september*¬†  This is roughly a¬†*1,500%*¬†increase from the current prices within the next few months. Anticipation alone should drive the price upward.¬†  Bio-Matrix Scientific group has just entered quarter 4 of their fiscal year and thus far have achieved every aspect of their timeline on time if not earlier than expected.¬† Now lets be conservative, and say that only one drug made it to Phase II by the end of the year. This would put the BMSN market cap at about $140,000,000, yielding a¬†*share price of .07.*¬†  So if both drugs were to make it on to phase II by the end of the year you would be seeing a share price of a¬†*dime (.1)*¬†solely based on expected market cap of two Phase II drugs divided by the outstanding share number. That does not account for anticipation price of mergers, buyouts, and funding. The sky is the limit for this stock!¬†  *What is MinTechnology?*¬†  Take a look at his website! KNOW WHAT YOU OWN!!! He is the real deal!¬† http://publish.uwo.ca/~mweiping/ ¬†  *What is HemaXellreate?*¬† http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/pdf/1479-5876-10-231.pdf   *Technicals:¬†*  Watch this quick video done by the brilliant guys at Bull Warrior Stocks and realize that the Stock is now in an uptrend.

t5_2cneq,thinkB4Uact,1373754614,"Apparently, people are too stupid to understand how the monetary system works. Everytime the truth comes to their faces, they repeat the same old tired bullshit and overlook the conflict of interest. I don't believe that means we deserve to be slaves, but I do believe that it means we will continue to be slaves.  Tell me, oh astute defenders of the financial status quo, how does one create money *without* yielding *free* goods and services purchasing value for someone or some organization?   How about this? A corporation called The People's Regional Community Monetary Storehouse, or PRCMS, makes $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢, but only lends them to my personally owned corporation that owns the PRCMS, the Infinite Freedom Bank or IFB. Currently the PRCMS charges 1% interest. The IFB loans you the $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢ at 5-10% interest. How does that deal sound to you? It sounds good to me. I'll get plenty of goods and services from suckers that accept my $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢ for doing nothing other than making $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢ via my proxy of ownership. Thanks for playing, astute observers of reality. Please, come again.  Oh it sounds like a scam? Ok. How about you the public, through your elected officials, get to pick the leadership at PRCMS and set its interest rate? Heck, you as the public can even keep the profits of PRCMS. Of course, it can't loan to the people directly, only to the IFB. That's ok then, as I can't get free $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢ from the PRCMS, because I have to pay it back with interest. That means I have to loan $uckerbucks‚Ñ¢ to you to pay back the PRCMS with interest in order to make my money. So it's ok right? That way you can feel like I am not getting an advantage of some kind, even though I am.   Go play some games and use your fucking brains instead of regurgitating the shit you were sold. You know I am selling a scam, but when it is done in nearly the same way on a larger scale with more institutions, it slides right on past your bullshit detectors. Think for yourselves. The monetary system is inherently corrupt.   Don't dispute me by trying to blind us with bullshit, by throwing out jargon and saying I should STFU, because I am not an expert. Persuade me by refuting the mechanics. Show me how the banks aren't getting a free ride in the money creation process in a clear and concise way.   EDIT: Every time I make a post like this on this topic, nobody effectively refutes me. It doesn't matter what tone I use. It clear to me that most of you just regurgitate facts and don't process them together to understand the mechanics of the game. I challenge anyone to put me in my place by showing me how my perception is wrong. When all I get are vacuous comments and down votes I just get even more cynical and lose hope that humanity will survive itself. We can't relegate our minds to authority and be free, because self-serving people *will* take advantage of us. It seems that the bigger the scam the less able people are to question it.  Someone show me where I am wrong. I want to be wrong, but I don't want to stick my head up my ass and tell myself it smells like sunshine. ",‚Ñ¢

Secondly,  &gt; Let's say jan 2011, It could be done then.  NO. IT. CAN'T. You're describing my rig:   &gt; AMDs 6000 series would have been released.  I *have* an AMD 6000 series GPU. It's a great piece of hardware, rated one of the best GPU values ever, but it is in no way capable of maxing Crysis 3, not even the 6950, the top end one.   Just so we can finally shut this fucking thing down, I dug up my order for my brand new, top-of-the-line gaming PC from March, 2011. The only part that could have had an appreciable impact was the 6850, but again, it was rated, pound per pound, as one of ***the best graphics cards on the market*** at the time and was definitely in AMD's lower High tier, and I had a budget to stick to; the next one up performance wise was a couple hundred more.   As you can can see, this sum'bitch ran me nearly $1200, and only $159 of that was for the monitor (I didn't have an LCD monitor before that, so it was a necessary expense).  So, ***NO. AGAIN, NO*** you could NOT build a PC for $670 from 2010 or even January 2011 and have it come anywhere *near* Crysis 3's upper levels. I have to play on Medium/Low to get acceptable performance. This is coming from Crysis 1 Maxed out at ~37-50FPS (I have 12GB of RAM now and newer drivers), Crysis 2 SP on the Max DX11 settings, NO HD texture pack (not enough vRAM- only 1GB) at an average of ~35ish FPS, Battlefield 2 on High/Ultra mix around 35-50FPS, and Far Cry 2 MAX'd at 113FPS max, 80+Average.

I sacrificed everything I could. I even got a shittier case in order to maximize my dollars.  I took the slow build discount, the LCD discount, the Tax-Free route of buying out of state, the $109 shipping discount; I took EVERY DISCOUNT THERE WAS.   You know why I *bought* the PC instead of buying the pieces separately and hand assembling it like I normally do?? ***BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD THE PC THAN TO BUY ONE***.

The Immunity Statute is [776.032](http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/776.032.html)  &gt;A person who uses force as permitted in s. 776.012, s. 776.013, or s. 776.031 is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force...  Note those three referenced statutes. [776.012](http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/776.012.html) is general self-defense statute, and includes the Stand Your Ground language. [776.013](http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/776.013.html) gives Castle Doctrine clauses. [776.031](http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/776.031.html) is defense-of-others.  Now, let's go through your claims:  &gt; No it is not up to the civil court to determine if immune applies.   The last paragraph of 776.032 reads as follows:  &gt;&gt;The court shall award reasonable attorney√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fees, court costs, compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred by the defendant in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as provided in subsection (1).  Clearly, the civil court does in fact make this determination for any civil case brought against the defendant.   &gt;Although right now he does not have immunity because immunity is only given if he won a stand your ground case and he did not.   No, immunity is conferred if the court determines the use of force was consistent with self defense, castle doctrine, and defense-of-others. It doesn't apply to ""Stand Your Ground"", because ""Stand Your Ground"" is not a type of self defense, it's a condition of self-defense.   &gt;He was found not guilty in a self defense case.   True.   &gt;In a self defense case the verdict is determined by a jury   True.  &gt;in a stand your ground case a verdict is determined by a single judge.  False. All Stand Your Ground does is tell the jury that a defendant has no duty to retreat. It has absolutely no bearing on immunity.

Firstly, through the glass of water analogy. He says Guru Nanak was the glass, but extending that, we humans are drops of water. There is God within all of us.  Secondly, the video quotes this shabad from Guru Arjun Dev Ji ([Ang 864](http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0&amp;Param=864)):   &gt; *Gur parmesar eko jƒÅ·πá.*   &gt; **Know that the Guru and the Transcendent Lord are One.**  &gt; *Jo ·πØis b·∫ñƒÅvai so parvƒÅ·πá. ||1|| rahƒÅ‚ñ´o.*   &gt; Whatever pleases Him is acceptable and approved. ||1||Pause||  &gt; *Gur c·∫ñar·πáƒ´ jƒÅ kƒÅ man lƒÅgai.*   &gt; One whose mind is attached to the Guru's feet -  &gt; *·∏é≈´k·∫ñ ·∏èara·∏è b·∫ñaram ·πØƒÅ kƒÅ b·∫ñƒÅgai.*   &gt; his pains, sufferings and doubts run away.  &gt; *Gur kƒ´ sevƒÅ pƒÅ‚ñ´e mƒÅn.*  &gt; **Serving the Guru, honor is obtained.**  &gt;  *Gur ≈´par sa·∏èƒÅ kurbƒÅn. ||2||*  &gt; **I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru. ||2||**  &gt; *Gur kƒÅ ·∏èarsan ·∏èek·∫ñ nihƒÅl.*  &gt;  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I am exalted.  &gt;  *Gur ke sevak kƒ´ p≈´ran g·∫ñƒÅl.*  &gt; The work of the Guru's servant is perfect.  &gt;  *Gur ke sevak ka‚ñ´o ·∏èuk·∫ñ na bi‚ñ´ƒÅpai.*  &gt; Pain does not afflict the Guru's servant.  &gt;  *Gur kƒÅ sevak ·∏èah ·∏èis jƒÅpai. ||3||*  &gt; The Guru's servant is famous in the ten directions. ||3||  &gt; *Gur kƒ´ mahimƒÅ kathan na jƒÅ‚ñ´e.*   &gt; The Guru's glory cannot be described.  &gt; *PƒÅrbarahm gur rahi‚ñ´ƒÅ samƒÅ‚ñ´e.*   &gt; The Guru remains absorbed in the Supreme Lord God.  &gt; *Kaho NƒÅnak jƒÅ ke p≈´re b·∫ñƒÅg.*   &gt; **Says Nanak, one who is blessed with perfect destiny -**  &gt; *Gur c·∫ñar·πáƒ´ ·πØƒÅ kƒÅ man lƒÅg. ||4||6||8||*   &gt; **his mind is attached to the Guru's feet.**     My understanding of that shabad is that God and Teacher are synonymous, and through serving this Teacher, honor is obtained.

t5_2s7tt,youcantbserious,1373859297,"The link is working for me, but...   From http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;amp;id=7991081 &gt;Texas lawmaker seeks to remove probation as punishment option for murder conviction | abc13.com  &gt;HOUSTON (KTRK) -- Right now in Texas, it's possible to get convicted of murder and never spend a single day in prison. But one local lawmaker is working to change the ability of convicts to get just probation for murder.  &gt;It's a law that has left many families frustrated and victim's advocates downright surprised to learn someone can be convicted of murder in Texas and never spend a day in prison. Carolyn Hardin's 26-year-old son Steven was murdered in 1998. Barry Bernard Crawford was convicted of murdering him as Hardin, a tow truck driver at the time, was preparing to tow his vehicle. ""We'll never go back to normal; our life will never be normal again, but we have to keep going on,"" she said. Jurors sentenced him to 10 years probation and a $10,000 fine. It was a sentencing that stunned the victim's family, even more so that it was even an option for jurors. ""Not only as hurt by what Barry Crawford did by killing my brother that day, but hurt by our judicial system,"" said Tonya Hardin, Steven's sister. Since 2005 in Harris County alone, more than 100 convicted killers have been sentenced to probation or deferred adjudication. ""It absolutely floored me; it basically just says, you know what, you've got people in prison for drugs and other non-violent offenses and then you got people who intentionally, knowingly take another human being's life that are walking the streets -- something wrong with that picture,"" Mayor's Crime Victim's Advocate Andy Kahan said. Last session, lawmakers passed a law that would prevent jurors from granting probation, but right now, judges still have that discretion if the defendant has no prior record. State Rep. Scott Hochberg is trying to change that, authoring a bill that would make defendants charged with murder ineligible for probation. The Hardins testified with their story in Austin Wednesday. ""It's not going to bring my brother back, but all we can do is fight to save someone else from going through what my family has been through,"" Tonya Hardin said. Crawford's probation came to an end last year, even though the Hardin's never received the restitution they were owed or the justice they believe they deserved. ""I will be there, if it takes that long and there is breath in my body, I will fight,"" Carolyn Hardin said. If it passes this session, the bill would take effect September 1 of this year but it would apply only to crimes committed on or after the effective date. (Copyright ¬©2013 KTRK-TV/DT.

t5_2rfo4,DrunkenSikh,1373862740,"Disclaimer: I am no expert in Sikhi, just a Sikh who is on the journey on increasing his knowledge of Sikhi.   I hate that video because it is inaccurate. The reason for keeping the hair is that it is a hukam from Guru Gobind Singh Ji. That's it.   Another misconception that some people (including the guy from basicsofsikhi) propagate is that the Dasam Duar is located on the head and so we tie a turban. Dasam duar is supposed to be a more general concept -- the 10th door into our jiv or atma that we want to open so that we can connect with the parmatma.   From ([Ang 974](http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;g=0&amp;h=0&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0&amp;Param=974)):  &gt; Upjai gi‚ñ´ƒÅn ·∏èurma·πØ c·∫ñ·∫ñƒ´jai.   &gt; Spiritual wisdom wells up, and evil-mindedness departs;  &gt; Amri·πØ ras gagnan·πØar b·∫ñƒ´jai. the nucleus of the mind sky is drenched with Ambrosial Nectar.  &gt; ƒñs kalƒÅ jo jƒÅ·πáai b·∫ñe‚ñ´o.

There is faith/instinct/trust everywhere. We trust our instincts just to navigate through life. We trust that the bus driver is not going to crash the bus. We have a certain amount of faith in the system. We trust it. The physics grad student has faith in himself that if he spends 10 million hours on his PhD, he may make a breakthrough. Our knowledge of the world has always been increasing generalizations (newton's view to einstein's view to the new QM view of gravity), and we trust these things until something else comes in and replaces then. Einstein trusted in himself so much that he was working on the ToE even on his deathbed. I think it is fair to say everyone has a balance of empirical evidence with extrapolation based on a certain amount of trust and faith. If you have ever attempted to start a business or been part of a startup, you will know! I am not a big fan of [positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) because I think it limits the creative genius of the human brain, and restricts it from ""going outside the box"".    In Sikhi, the ultimate trust is placed in God. The Gurus tell us that regardless of what goes on in the world, keep your focus on Wahe Guru and accept what comes with [chardi kala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charhdi_Kala). The Gurus gave us recommendations like control the [panj vikar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Thieves), follow the [3 pillars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_pillars_of_Sikhism) (which is just our way of condensing the idea into easily understandable sound-bytes).   On a personal level, I keep uncut hair and proudly wear the turban because it was a [hukam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukam) from the 10th guru and identifies me with the beautiful concepts of Sikhism -- not because I get special points with Wahe Guru. I try to study and practice [Gurbani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurbani). One of the ways is by seeing God in everyone that I meet and interact with, which helps me practice [sat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_(Sanskrit\)#In_Sikhism), [daya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daya), pyar (love) and [vand chak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8D_Chakk%C5%8D). I am wary of rituals and superstitions because the message of Sikhi is pretty simple and doesn't rely on them. I practice [kirat karni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirat_Karo) but try to keep [santokh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santokh) and [nimrata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrata) as I love being in [chardi kala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charhdi_Kala).    I don't think I've personally faced a situation in which I had to choose between Sikhi and something else, except for not giving Sikhi enough time (because of my own shortcomings). Sikhi doesn't tell me to reject evolution, or impose a particular form of government. It doesn't tell me I should ignore people of certain faiths or not do business with them. I often wonder what I would do if I was in my 20s in 1984 Punjab.... I just don't know. ",‚ñ´

t5_2uhpg,MoogleBoy,1373867409,"I'm rather confused by your first section. You say you dislike the idea of limiting certain affixes to certain slots, but then you want them to add a new slot specifically for one affix. Personally, once I figured out where each affix goes, I didn't mind the current system, because it reduces randomness by limiting where a particular affix can go. This makes finding a ""perfect"" piece a lot easier.   Most of your ""useless or under powered"" affixes are spot on. I might disagree on Thorns and HP/Minute, but it's a personal preference thing.  Letting us choose which affix to roll for on the costumes is a terrible idea. The point of the costume affixes is to be a money sink. Allowing us to reduce the randomness, even a little, would lessen the purpose of the system. I do, however, completely agree that the crappy Affixes should either be revisited or removed entirely.  +1 to all skills is currently an affix, it's just limited to Cosmic rarity items. Life Leech, Spirit Leech (omg yes please), and more, unique procs would be very welcome. Maybe not so much on the +1 Attribute affix though. More costumes cores are definitely something I wouldn't complain about either, and you've listed some pretty decent ones.  I'd just like to point out that D2 didn't launch with runewords. D2 also had its fair share of crap affixes as well. It wasn't until patch 1.07 that they had more than five hotkeys as well, though, that's more to the people who (rightfully) complain about how little skill space there is.   I'd rather we only have one ""artifact"" slot, and add a Ring, Necklace and one other ""Accessory"" slot. Move the current artifacts into the appropriate groups, make new items with interesting effects, profit. Also, I'm sure I read that Uniques are coming, and soon‚Ñ¢, but I haven't heard anything about set items, and I would enjoy those as well.  The item upgrade system is meant to drain credits from you, same as the costume affixes. It's meant to be MH's version of Gheed, essentially. As for the next point, it's possible that one of two things is happening. You are legitimately getting one bonus affix, or you're actually getting two, but one is rolling into a pre-existing affix. There are a few topics around here and on the official forums about ""double upping"" on certain affixes via lucky upgrade rolls.  Anyway, all in all a solid, thought out post. I don't agree with you on all the topics listed, but such is life. Just try to remember that MH is still in infancy. Diablo 2 didn't become the crowned king of ARPGs right at launch, and Diablo 3 is STILL fucked, a full year after its launch. The team at Gaz has been improving, showing attentiveness, and listening to feedback, so I have high hopes for the future of the game.",‚Ñ¢
t5_2s3nb,IAMAVelociraptorAMA,1373867515,"We arrived at Sari with the sun now firmly in the sky.  There was no smoke, no smell of fire.  The military was out in force, and we could see the planes circling overhead, but there was no fighting.  Sari was safe.  Noor was still knocked out, but I could tell she was close to waking up.  She had this habit of turning in her sleep when she left her dreams.  I used to think she was fighting to stay asleep.  Sayeh turned to me and smiled.  ‚ÄúWould you like to speak to the soldiers?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI'd rather repent.  You go be cute as a button and get us through without issue,‚Äù I said.  We rolled up to the military checkpoint and she produced identification showing her as a nurse.  She spoke with the young man at the window, her voice light against the sound of motors and machines.  He could not keep his eyes from glancing down and she did nothing to dissuade him.  As much as I loved Sayeh, I felt that primal rage of possession flare up in my heart.  I knew in my head she was only trying to smooth the checkpoint over, but far below I felt hot.  Blind, deaf, hot ---  There was a brief moment when, suspended in time, I lived a full life.  Sayeh and I never experienced war, never chased after another, never had to fight for another thing in our lives.  We lived in sunny Florida, grew old, grew blind, grew deaf.  Then, as we faded back into dust, I found myself crashing back to reality.  The heat, the sensory overload ‚Äì it all came not from an imagination, but from the missile that had landed so close as to flip my car and scatter the man outside into a half dozen pieces.    ‚ÄúSayeh!  Noor!‚Äù  I could say nothing but their names.  ‚ÄúSayeh!  Noor!‚Äù  I could think nothing but their names.  Sayeh!  Noor!  My two girls, one my daughter, one my lover ‚Äì Sayeh, Noor.  My restraining belt yielded easily and I fell to the floor, or the roof, or the ground, more like.  My head ached from the small fall, but the pain was pushed from my mind at the thought of Sayeh or Noor in pain.  As my eyes adjusted to seeing again, and my ears adjusted to hearing, I had to have my body adjust to being upside down.  My eyes slowly took in my fear ‚Äì Sayeh was slumped down, her body straining against the restraining belt, and Noor was flailing wildly in her seat.  I could not hear, just a ringing, that damned ringing that would haunt me again and again, but I saw Noor moving, and my heart and mind jumped to Sayeh.  I could not unrestrain her for risk of her falling and hurting herself like I did, and she was far more frail than I.  She was the nurse so I tried to remember what to do in case of a car accident.  Then, at that inopportune moment, I started to laugh.  This was no car accident.  I shouldn't be so calm!  This was an attack, an assault on our lives!  By all means I should have been freaking out, or perhaps in shock.  I had been driven from my home and within hours been near a missile strike, my car flipped, and my head hit.  There was no reason for me to be calmly trying to look after Sayeh, to be crawling around an overturned vehicle to try to help.  The military should be doing this!  But, as with everything involving Sayeh, she pushed herself to the forefront then without even having to try.  My mind was occupied not on circumstance, not on history or location or even state of mind, but only on the woman before me, on Sayeh and those strands of hair and the blood ‚Äì the blood!  I found and felt the blood on her head, and groped my hand around to the plastic edge of the car, where her head and whipped back and broken the skin.  There wasn't a lot, just enough to hurt her, and just enough to hurt me.  Then, as the vibrations of further impacts shook me and forced me to hold on to keep from slipping, I found her slipping from my fingers, and an orange-red light in my eye.  The military rushed in to save their checkpoint soldier and instead found us to save.  Or, at least, they found her, and they found my daughter.  I found myself without any hands on me, to pull me out.  Whatever they were doing, I could not understand.  My head was clouded, I was in pain, my ears would still not work.  All I could do was crawl forward and attempt to get out of the door that they had pulled Sayeh out through.  All I could think of was what I would do to the son of a bitch who had his hands on her, who was taking her away from me, who was probably going to throw her into a military hospital to get bombed by the Turkmen.  All I could think of was Sayeh.  And, as I would learn in the coming months, that would be the driving force behind our improbable journey.  -----   Thanks for reading that excerpt!

Then bad something happens. The videos start to change. someone left, the videos go to new places, new people come on, ect. So they start saying ""*If you don't go back I'll unsub*"" or ""*Fucking unsubed*"" or ""*God, you guys suck now. You all are fucking awful and should die*"" People reply as ""*Dude, gtfo faggot. Stop being a mega-cunt.*"" They find it funny how people are raging and getting angry at the comments, so they start posting some as bait. This is how it starts.  ###2 *Troll.*   The bait works, and people get angry. ""*THIS IS WHY I HATE THE*[insert_uploaders_name_here]*FANBASE, BITCHES LIKE YOU!!*"" They think it's hilarious how people don't know they're trolling. They post more and more, and they get more crude. ""*Wow, I can't believe so many faggots watch* [insert_uploaders_name_here] *still. I mean, they suck dick. The guys are fagots and their alful*"" People react worse to the misspelled ones, saying such things as ""*Kid, fuck off. No one cares about what you think of* [insert_uploaders_name_here]"" so they misspell them even more. ""*omg* [insert_uploaders_misspelled_name_here] *sux al off u gus r fagits 4 waching tem*"" This does not always happen however. After a while people start to notice the same person uploading the comments, and call them out for it. After a week or so the rage stops. People just flag for spam and move on. Only replying ""*God, you suck as a troll.*"" and ""*Never stop posting these comments, they are so fucking funny.*""  ###3 *Jokester.*  The troll sees that people now know he's a troll and they only see him as a form of entertainment. So they embrace it, writing vastly exaggerated comments such as ""*If you guys don't go back to the way you were and get even better then I'll rape 100 babies in your name.*"" This is the last form of the ex-fans life, they can't go back to being a fan or else people will say ""Fuck off you wanker and never come back"" and they can't try to troll without people saying ""This is too funny."" So they just try and make people laugh. It's a self-parody. This can go on and never stop or it can stop a few days after it happens.

The  massive amounts of misinformation and poor husbandry is something that many are trying to help solve and to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future.   Regarding the images, ~~I don't see any fractures past or present.~~  so with respect to u/garythecoconut I'm going to discount MBD as the main underlying cause of this animals problems.  [whoops, yeah that back wrist joint was fractured and collapsed!], garythecoconut was correct that this female wasn't getting it's supplements! I think I was distracted by the ribs being intact - my bad.   The animal has enlarged it's chest cavity and is ""head up"" vertical vs being perched.  This behavior is the usual response to a lung infection and resulting fluid build up that chokes the animal.    Another sign will be ""deep breaths"" or ""gasping/rasping"" for air that the OP may not have noticed or heard from behind the glass tank it's in. :|  Basically she's got a advanced lung infection that is killing her.  Typical treatment is with measured doses of [Baytril (Enrofloxacin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrofloxacin) Oral works great but it's hard on their systems and given the weakened state ... the outlook is not good.  When an animal gets to this late stage of emaciation the organs start to shut down and recovery is already very slim to zero the secondary issue (infection) I fear is going to be too much for it.   ***Emergency treatment*** *will be to rehydrate with a solution of 1 part gator-aid, 1 part water and 1 part* [*vanilla flavored Glucerna‚Ñ¢*](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Glucerna-Homemade-Vanilla-8-Fl-Oz-Shake-6-Ct/10308371) [with a dash of vitamin / calcium + vitamin D3 powder added and mixed into the solution] Supply this with an eye dropper, don't force it as it's not going to want to risk choking and drowning in it's fluid filled lungs.   *This is intended to get some fluids and calories into her, as well as, some sugars and proteins.  Also remove her from her tank and place her in a temp setup as described int he sidebar of the /r/Chameleons sub. If she starts to regain strength, and makes it past the next 24 hours you can try to start a small dose of antibiotics*   I don't want to beat the OP up because it sounds like they're young and quite inexperienced with these animals but basically the veiled has been (unintentionally) starved complicated by a poor diet (meal worms = doritos‚Ñ¢).  This in combination with a improper housing (that didn't allow for proper air flow among several other things) paved the way for a lung infection to take hold and will eventually kill most chameleon species.  Personally, I don't think that whoever supplied you with this animal spent enough time making sure that the OP was properly informed enough to take care of it... it should have never been sold to the OP until they were prepared to take care of it.  Unfortunately,  This is how many keepers learn as most people haven't seen a healthy cage setup and even many video's on youtube give incorrect advice and more often show exactly how to **not** keep an animal healthy and happy.    So OP, take this as a chance to learn what to and what not to do with these animals. [make sure that you use a proper supplement formulation specific for these animals!)  They're great to have as long as certain requirements are met.. but you can't take shortcuts and not give them what they need to thrive.  They make excellent and dynamic pets but again there's far too much information out there and people selling animals for a quick buck to people not able to take proper care of them (if they themselves even know what it takes to keep them)  Feel free to visit us at the sub and ask as many questions as you want. When you're ready, we'll help you along with finding another good animal to keep.   [edited I missed the back wrist joint fracture that **garythecoconut** spotted]  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1373909139,"&gt;###KOTOR ‚Äì 10 Years Later - 07.15.2013  &gt;I‚Äôm James Ohlen, Studio Creative Director at BioWare. You probably know me as the Game Director on Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢, but I‚Äôve also been the lead designer of older BioWare games such as Baldur‚Äôs Gate 1+2, Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age and Star Wars‚Ñ¢: Knights of the Old Republic‚Ñ¢.  &gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic turns ten years old today. Due to the influence KotOR had on the vision of The Old Republic, we‚Äôre celebrating the day in several ways. We‚Äôre putting a KotOR related player title up for sale in the Cartel Market for 10 Cartel Coins. In addition, we‚Äôre giving away free Cartel Coins on Facebook at 10:00 am today and throughout the day worldwide, but that is not all! For more, make sure to read our announcement here.  &gt;I‚Äôd like to take the opportunity to discuss the influence Knights of the Old Republic had on SWTOR.  &gt;Back in 2006, when we first discussed doing a MMORPG we threw around a lot of different ideas. We wrote up pitches for a number of other very popular intellectual properties. Some pitches never made it past BioWare, while others went a little further.  &gt;We eventually decided on a Star Wars MMORPG set in The Old Republic era. Why? It was clear that SWTOR was what our fans wanted and the obvious best choice. Knights of the Old Republic is one of the games that defined what BioWare is to modern fans. It didn‚Äôt just influence SWTOR; most of the team that worked on it went on to create the Mass Effect franchise.  &gt;There are many reasons why Knights of the Old Republic resonated so much with fans. But a simple one was the fact that the Star Wars IP is a natural fit for RPGs. Since the first movie was released in 1977, fans have wanted to live in that universe. As children, a lot of you probably used action figures to create your own stories in the Star Wars galaxy. RPGs are just a more sophisticated way of immersing yourself in another world. Knights of the Old Republic also drew inspiration from the original trilogy. A lot of fans were looking for a story that evoked the spirit of the original trilogy and Knights of the Old Republic seemed to give them that. And of course there was the famous twist.  &gt;How did Knights of The Old Republic influence Star Wars: The Old Republic? We felt it was important to give fans an online world that drew inspiration from KotOR. The parts of KotOR we felt were most important to get integrate included:  &gt;* Epic storytelling in The Old Republic era * Cinematic storytelling * The internal struggle between good and evil * Becoming a Jedi * Owning your own Millennium Falcon inspired starship * Traveling to many different worlds * Adventuring with companion characters that you cared about.  &gt;All of these were key elements that we knew we wanted included from the very start of development. The good news is that all of these elements are featured prominently in SWTOR. These features also make SWTOR unique amongst MMORPGs, and helped forge what has become one of the strongest game communities in the history of online RPGs.  &gt;Star Wars: The Old Republic has now become the primary representation of The Old Republic era to fans. Millions and millions of people have played it generating millions of hours of game play. Thousands of new fans try out the game every single month. It has provided more content and stories than all of the Star Wars movies and TV series combined. Until the launch of the new Battlefront game (and I‚Äôm just as excited as the rest of you about DICE creating a new Battlefront game), SWTOR will be the primary core interactive experiences in the Star Wars universe.  &gt;Ten years from its release, I think people will look back on the scope and quality of storytelling in SWTOR and realize its impact on popular culture. Considering how the SWTOR community is thriving right now, I think we‚Äôll be celebrating the anniversary of SWTOR right here on the website!  &gt;James Ohlen   Studio Creative Director",‚Ñ¢

Every drop is one step closer to your death. You can't do anything to stop it, you just know somewhere it's dripping away your life.  I think it really helps conceptualize mortality.

Meanwhile, a horridly obese man emerged from the forest in full Klan regalia, waving goodbye to his fellow Tea-Party racist republican NRA members after another rally to promote rape culture against womyn and minorities. ""Great meeting, you guys!"" he shouted as he waved behind him. The man removed his Klan hood to reveal the hideous face of none other than George Zimmerman; his blond hair, pale white skin, and swastika tattoo in prominent display.  Suddenly, the evil tiny-dicked white NRA racist spotted innocent Trayvon playing with the happy animals in a scene reminiscent of Bambi. Enraged, the racist Zimmerman phoned the police. ""BIPPITY BAPPITY YIPPITY YAPPITY YEAHAAWW TARNATION Y'ALL DE'RES A GODDAMN NIGGER IN THESE PARTS"" he screeched at the operator while waving his Confederate flag. ""I'M GONNA SHOOT ME A GODDAMN COON SKINNED NIGGER""  ""No, please, don't do that you racist!"" the 911 operator cried! ""I am giving you a legally binding directive not to leave your gas-guzzling global warming causing rapist car with confederate flag and Romney 2012 bumperstickers! Spare that sweet, innocent little boy!""  But the racist small dicked white NRA member Zimmerman had no mercy in his heart when he murdered poor baby toddler like jolly Trayvon with his tiny-dicked compensation assault pistol. Flashes of MLK Jr and a thousand slaves being whipped flashed through Trayvon's mind to the chorus of angel choir as he ascended into heaven, while Zimmerman and the racist cracka ass police danced around Trayvon's corpse firing guns into the air like Yosemite Sam.  Knowing Zimmerman would need evidence in his favor for crimes they weren't going to charge him for, the racist police helped Zimmerman fake head injuries to make his story convincing.",‚Ñ¢

The chill winds of Ashtarte had started blowing from the north, covering our city in a feathery white. The caravans had stalled, and we didn't know where the food would come from, let alone our Booster Packs‚Ñ¢. Young Elidras, the mystic apprentice had been in and out of a coma for days on end. In the spells when he would wake, his parched and ragged voice would sputter:  ""It... comes...""  As the winter's cruel knife plunged our community into more agony, we started hearing rumors. That a young ragamuffin named Dirk had a hidden cache of Rise of the Eldrazi Boosters. They might let us draft once again on this dark and dreary night.  At first, we ignored it.  Then we grumbled about it.  Then we started plotting.  Finally- and no one knows who exactly committed the foul deed- we found young Nick with an icicle stuck in his eye socket. And at the inn the people were clamoring: a whole CASE! The little bastard had a whole CASE of RoE.  So, with Ashtarte's dread moaning still haunting the dark, the whole town (minus Nick, Serra have mercy on his soul) sat down for a Rise of the Eldrazi impromptu Mini Grand Prix.  ""Everyone! Open your boosters!"" the good Head Judge Olamarck Destride yelled into the night. We all put away thoughts of foul murder and gladly ripped into our first booster pack.  Angry grumbles.  ""What in the seventh circle of Asmodeus's crotch is going on?!? My entire pack is full of Mudholes!""  Angry mumbles across the room. Everyone's first pack of RoE had held 15 identical replicas of the utterly unplayable rare. Was this some kind of cruel joke on Dead Nick's part?  We thought we had opened the worst booster possible, but nothing compared to what happened next as people started ripping into their remaining product. First, Olaf the Breadmaker sliced his thumb clean off, with one hell of a cardstock papercut. The pack had been filled with Grinning Ignus. Then a swarm of angry hornets came spilling out of another booster. Then a torrent of blood. One person simply exploded upon opening his booster.  Quickly, the entire hall had stopped opening booster and set them all ablaze in the center of the room. A giant bonfire to immolate the damned Sealed Product‚Ñ¢. The fire roared with anger, and everyone in that hall saw a vision of their future death reflected in the burning glare.  One pack survived the burning.  Kevin, the town fool, had a bad habit of always ripping packs and not saving them for drafts, as a good boy should. He picked up the pack.  ""Nay Kevin! Dynit opin dat pack!"" old man McCallister yelled.  But Kevin didn't listen. Kevin opened that last, cursed pack of RoE.  That was the worst booster pack ever opened.  To this day, I don't quite understand what I saw, but the consensus is that Emrakul Himself sent a tentacle through the pack and nabbed Kevin, pulling him forever out of this dimension and into the Blind Eternities. Where he still screams.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhx4,neuro_neurd,1373926123,"Along these lines, while research doesn't seem to be conclusive at this point, some suggest that artificial sweeteners may affect insulin and/or metabolic pathways. Sadly I don't have time to do a thorough lit search search but from [this review paper by Brown et al.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3109/17477160903497027/pdf):    ""Sweet-taste receptors, including the taste receptor T1R family and Œ± -gustducin, respond not only to caloric sugars, such as sucrose and glucose, but also to artificial sweeteners, including sucralose (Splenda‚Ñ¢) and acesulfame-K. In both humans and animals, these receptors have been shown to be present not only in lingual taste buds, but also in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreting L cells of the gut mucosa, where they serve as critical mediators of GLP-1 secretion. Mace et al. showed in rat studies that stimulation of intestinal taste receptors with sucralose led to more rapid absorption of sugars from the intestine into the bloodstream. We have demonstrated in young healthy volunteers that consumption of diet soda before an oral glucose challenge potentiates GLP-1 secretion, thus potentially altering both gastric emptying and insulin secretion. Translating these results into the clinical realm, consumption of an artificial sweetener in conjunction with a sugar-containing food or drink could lead to more rapid sugar absorption, as well as increased GLP-1 and insulin secretion, potentially affecting weight, appetite, and glycemia.""  TL;DR Artificial sweeteners may affect your insulin response and gastric emptying. ",‚Ñ¢

All of them could be crafted from mining extracted material in a block factory device and we could use them to build the ships. Of course this is just an idea though. So if we gather lots of silicon from a planet's surface, we could melt it into glass and build glass blocks in all above sizes. The same with iron, titanium and most other solid materials.

t5_2u6rc,maphew_turnaround,1373937363,"Better late then never, but I'll give you a shot :  &gt;why do people see a purge as such a bad idea?  It's a complete disregard of what we know to be civil society for the past several millenia, purges have occurred throughout history in pockets of spontaneity as recent as the early 90s during the Yugoslav Wars and the ""African Civil War"". To have a designated and guaranteed massacre taking place every year is unimaginably inhuman, we have hospitals and firefighters and police to prevent loss of life at every opportunity, this annual purge would spit in the face of all that effort.  &gt;If the purge yielded the same economical/social benefits as it portrays in the movie in real life  You should have payed attention to the world being built in the movie, taking note especially of the talk show hosts being heard at the beginning and after the end when the credits roll. I beg you to stop thinking about human beings in terms of numbers and abstract concepts like ""the nation"", ""the economy"", ""the society"" and what not, it makes you blind to what can transpire when you reduce men to an equation, were you listening to the young sociopath raving on about ""saving/cleansing your soul"" ? That's because he doesn't have one in the world he's living in, or if he thinks he does he definitely thinks it needs to be washed away of sin.  &gt;Crime is already happening every day  No shit.  &gt;solely eliminating those who either mooch off the govt. because they're too lazy to work, or those who don't contribute to economical growth whatsoever  Jesus, it really scratches my innards when i hear people pull these words out of their mouths and not feel like they're ripping their teeth out with every sentence. Economical growth isn't necessarily a good thing, shocking i know. Lazy leeches and parasite and other nicknames the Masters of the Universe‚Ñ¢ like to throw around are very ignorant and uncaring dismissals that fail to look at the whole picture before throwing everyone in the same designated trashcan.  &gt;homeless people who have no intentions of even making an attempt to find work  If you're homeless you have very few options of escaping that position, because unsurprisingly no one will help you get back on your feet. Those who do out of pity or to feel good about themselves will only be a short term Samaritan that leaves you to rot after they've washed their hands of you. Sorry, but you're not doing anyone a favor by killing hobos, not the economy, not to human dignity or the sanctity of life or to making people less murder-happy in their day to day lives.  Hobos already get killed all the time because people know they can get away with it, but at least it's not fucking advertised and recommended by the government as a national holiday. Christ.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh3l,Qikfunder,1373945969," We are proud to introduce the newest, most innovative and just plain awesome crowdfunding platform to hit the web.   Meet QiKfunder  QiKfunder‚Ñ¢ hosts several unique features that make us the best option for your crowdfunding needs. First and foremost is our Fund it Back‚Ñ¢ program, project creators have the option to opt-in and will be able to choose from our current featured causes. This indicates that the project creator is willing to donate 1% of their funds raised to the cause they select. The benefit to the project creator is that his or her project will be highlighted with a bright orange border and hosts the Fund it Back program logo as well as allowing our community members to become involved with helping others.  Another feature unique to QiKfunder is our sliding scale model. If a project is fully funded, QiKfunder receives only 4% - lower than most competitors! We know that with a little creativity and hard work, many projects can still be completed as long as they reach at least 50% of their goal. For this reason we developed the Sliding Scale to give the projects the best possible chance to succeed. A project that is funded between 50% and 99% is charged a percentage based off of our sliding scale. 50-69% = 8% fee, 70-79% = 7% fee, 80-89% = 6% fee, 90-99% = 5% fee, 100 % and up = 4% fee. Our sliding scale incentivizes entrepreneurs to reach full funding, and rewards them for doing so.  A third great feature of QiKfunder is the Spanish/English converter. We realize that communities are diverse and want to be able to cater to a wider audience. By doing this, we bring more traffic to project creator‚Äôs campaigns.  Lastly, QiKfunder hosts a messaging system. This makes it even easier for project creators and funders to communicate, making social funding more fluid and reliable. Funders can see that the project creator is a real person, making all projects hosted on our site more credible. These four features ensure success, and cannot be found on any other site. Visit QiKfunder for the best social funding experience available.  Thank you,  The QiKfunder Staff www.qikfunder.com",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qj8u,bovineblitz,1373950523,"There's a fairly broad range in which the roast can be, and as always it's up to interpretation.  Whoever is making the guidelines isn't necessarily going to nail it, it's a bit of a moving target.  **Style (proposed) -** &gt; Flavor: A balance between piney, citrus-like and spicy NW hop flavor, bitterness, caramel malt, and roast, chocolate, or Carafa-type malts. Roast character ranges from subtle to medium. Black malt is acceptable at low levels, but should not be astringent. Intense ashy, burnt character is not appropriate. Caramel malt as a secondary flavor is acceptable but the finish should be dry. Diacetyl should not be present. Emphasis should be on hop flavor.  **Smuttynose replication of Blackwatch recipe -**    6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess light, unhopped, liquid malt extract (=9.75lb 2-row)  1.5 lb. (0.68 kg) pale ale malt    12 oz. (0.34 kg) Belgian aromatic malt (25 ¬∞L)  10 oz. (0.28 kg) crystal malt (60 ¬∞L)  4 oz. (0.11 kg) black malt (600 ¬∞L)  1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafa¬Æ II malt (450 ¬∞L)      (follow special instructions)    11.3 AAU Magnum hops (0.81 oz./23 g of 14% alpha acid) (75 min.)  7.5 AAU Columbus hops (0.5 oz /14 g of 15% alpha acid) (30 min.)  3.75 AAU Columbus hops(0.25 oz. /7 g of 15% alpha acid) (20 min.)  3.75 AAU Columbus hops (0.25 oz./7 g of 15% alpha acid) (10 min.)  7.5 AAU Columbus hops (0.5 oz./14 g of 15% alpha acid) (0 min.)  Glacier hops (1.0 oz./28 g of 5.5% alpha acid) (dry hop, 7 days)  Nugget hops(1.0 oz./28 g of 13% alpha acid) (dry hop, 7 days)  ----- According to my calculations, that's 76 IBU in a 1.065 ale with a 2oz dry hop.  Should be about 7% ABV.  Lots of dank hops.  Touch of crystal.  1lb carafa II special and 4oz black malt will certainly be roasty, but it won't be stout roasty or ""roast-forward"".  Plus from what I hear they may have been added late to the mash.  There's room in the style for variation, and it's ONE style -  Hoppy dark ale that can be lightly to fairly roasty, typically with resiny hops as they complement the roast.  A black IPA is the same thing as a ""CDA"".  If we go by that naming scheme, we should call every beer with American hops ""Cascadian"".  edit: formatting",¬Æ

My original/normal recipe:  Ingredients: 6 eggs, 1/2 stalk of celery(finely chopped), 1/4 onion(finely chopped), 1/4 cup mayo, 1 dash hot sauce(or to taste 1 teaspoon Dijon-style prepared mustard), salt to taste, and paprika for garnish  Directions:   * Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel. * Cut eggs in half. Remove yolks and place in a medium bowl. Mash together with celery, onion, mayonnaise, salt and hot pepper sauce. * Stuff the egg white halves with the egg yolk mixture. Sprinkle eggs with paprika. Chill covered in the refrigerator until serving.   My other recipe adds guacamole to the mixture.   Ingredients: 4 whole eggs in the shell, 1/2 cup Guacamole dip, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, 1 minced green onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt (optional), 1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco¬Æ), or to taste 1 teaspoon Dijon-style prepared mustard, and  1 pinch paprika  Directions:  * Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 - 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, and peel. Slice eggs in half, and remove yolks to a mixing bowl. * In the bowl with the yolks, combine the Guacamole dip, cilantro and green onion. Season with salt, hot sauce, and mustard. Mix well, and fill empty egg halves. Chill until serving. Sprinkle with paprika just before serving.  I hope you guys enjoy! ",¬Æ

A crowd is built simply by inviting friends. These friends invite some friends of their own and so this quickly builds up and results in a pretty massive collections of friends and ""friends of friends"".  &gt;Later at release level 3 - the profit level - you will earn money with your crowd. There will be 2 ways to earn money with your crowd: An active and a passive way. Best thing: it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s for free - well, sort of: You will have to invest time and love.

t5_2ss6r,that_gave_me_an_idea,1373991028,"From the artists entry he added a description. My comment was just taking that idea and running with it.  A PRINCESS, A KNIGHT, AND A SORCERER  In the aftermath of the 7-year long Battle of Kazkhan, an all-out war between the kingdoms Abyssinia and Cordonne, Cordonne's victory is short-lived as their King is found brutally murdered in his bedchamber. What follows is a series of clandestine events that unite a princess, a knight and a sorcerer to solve their King's mysterious demise‚Ä¶  Princess Goes underground after her father, the King of Cordonne is murdered. The brooch she wears in her hair was a gift from the Monarch of Abyssinia 10 years ago, in an inter-kingdom banquet for the Pact of Peace between Abyssinia and Cordonne. She refuses to let it go, this symbol of a life she once had and a peace her father had once believed achievable. Armed with the Cusp of Monarchs, the sacred sword of the Cordonne Royal Bloodline, she seeks to unravel the mystery of her father's death.  Knight Served in the Battle of Kazkhan as an Armada Commandant of Cordonne's Elite Unit. Three years into the Battle of Kazkhan, the Knight is severely wounded. Disillusioned with the War, the Knight turns to skypiracy for several years. During the closing year of the Battle of Kazkhan, the King of Cordonne pleads for the Knight to return to the kingdom, this time as the blossoming Princess' retainer and mentor. When the King was murdered, the Knight immediately took the Princess underground, fearing that she would be the killer's next target.  Sorcerer One-time Royal Adviser and long-time friend of the King of Cordonne, the Sorcerer was vehemently against the war between Abyssinia and Cordonne. His stand against the war cost him not only his position as Royal Adviser, but also strained his friendship with the King. Speculators say that the Sorcerer was against the war because the battleground was his homeland of Kazkhan; but the Sorcerer maintains that the conflict might have been averted had the King practiced lenient diplomacy. Now, the day after the King is murdered, the King's daughter stands on his doorstep, asking for his help to exact vengeance.  Midnight Monarchs ¬© Chester Ocampo",¬©

t5_2fwo,badsectoracula,1374004745,"/u/chucker23n is technically right, but for some reason he's getting downvoted. Qt *does* use those APIs for drawing purposes but implements its own behaviour. And while the controls look mostly right, they are not the same as the ""native"" controls exposed by Win32 when you create them with `CreateWindow` and such (the only C++ library i know that does this in a cross-platform way is wxWidgets, but that has other cross-platform issues).  Having said that the differences aren't really as big and noticeable as they are between GTK+ and Win32. My biggest complain for Qt (which i encounter *a lot* at work because one of the programs we use regularly is written in Qt) is that it doesn't support shift+click on scrollbars to ""jump"" to the position you clicked at (similar to middle click in X11). Instead it simply scrolls lines.  Other differences are more subtle and less used, like broken support for alt+number to instert emoticons like ‚ò∫ and ‚òª (it inserts random stuff depending if you release the number or alt first), slightly different look in Win8 menubars, popup menus appearing a little slower than the native ones, etc. Another annoyance is that some programs use the Qt-provided file dialogs which do not support the libraries, bookmarks, ""breadcrumb bar"", custom icons from shell extensions (like VCS programs and Dropbox), etc that the standard Win32 dialogs provide.  Also there are some other issues, like programs that hook on `EDIT` windows/controls to provide spell checking or screen readers that try to obtain the window text via `GetWindowText` will not work with non-native controls unless those try to provide specialized support for those cases.",‚ò∫

Definitely that could be making a difference. The best thing you can do for yourself is have coffee or green tea (without sugar) and lots and lots and LOTS AND LOTS OF WATER. Water will be the best thing ever!  ‚Ä¢ If I keep my carbs low for the day, I'll have something sweet (usually 4-12 carbs) at night - is that detrimental to do right before sleep?  It really depends on what kind of sweets you‚Äôre talking about. If it‚Äôs a cake then it‚Äôs detrimental but if your deserts have berries or dark chocolate, I‚Äôd say it should be fine.   ‚Ä¢ A co-worker of mine has had success eating no carbs 6 days a week, with one cheat day. He doesn't go overboard, but doesn't limit so strictly on that day. He said it's good to give my body some carbs to ""wake it up"" or something to that effect. Is this a bad idea, and something that kills the Keto effect?  That's really a different response for different people. For some, what happens is that your body gets too use to the keto diet and that ‚Äúcheat day‚Äù is a reset for your body to be like whoa whoa whoa, we need to keep using the fat for energy to the max. However for others, it's better just to keep calm and keto on without cheat days. Experiment on what's the BEST FOR YOU.    ‚Ä¢ Should I be more closely monitoring whether or not I'm in ketosis? I'm assuming that &lt;30 g carbs per day would certainly be doing it.  You‚Äôre right, that SHOULD be doing it. However, the questions you should be asking yourself is this: Is my urine pungent and very yellowy? If so, then you‚Äôre DEFINITELY in ketosis. Do I have a sort of ‚Äúmetal mouth?‚Äù if so, they‚Äôre in ketosis. Have my cravings gone down and am I starting to feel fuller and fuller when I eat, then that‚Äôs not only ketosis but you changing yourself.   ‚Ä¢ Is there anything else I should be asking, but I'm not thinking about?  I wish I could answer this but when you have more Q‚Äôs then you‚Äôll be able to ask them. This community never goes away and there‚Äôs ALWAYS someone who will be able to help you out! ‚ò∫    GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE THE BEST FOR YOU :)",‚ò∫

t5_2qm4e,Dannei,1374008889,"Note to self: view the above things with my sister's sunglasses next time I steal them and try and find things that look funny.  Polarised sunglasses work on the principle of polarised light - simply put, photons (light particles) can vibrate vertically, horizontally or at any other angle. For most sources of light, the photons will indeed be going at any angle.  A polariser (which is what the lenses in sunglasses are) only lets light of a certain polarisation through - if our polariser is vertical, only vertically polarised light will pass through. However, any light with a vertical component (e.g. diagonally polarised) has a chance of passing through and being polarised to vertical - the closer the angle of polarisation to the filter, the higher the chance.  Over all angles for unpolarised light (light randomly polarised in all directions), this works out as half the light getting through - so your sunglasses work by filtering out half the light. The actual fraction is higher, because the lenses absorb some light themselves due to not being perfect transmitters of light.  However, polarised filters aren't the only way to get polarised light - reflections, such as those from car windows and clouds, also result in polarised light. If you're then viewing that light through your sunglasses, you're viewing light that is already polarised, and it will behave differently! Try rotating your sunglasses clockwise/anticlockwise and see how the reflection changes - this is because you're changing the angle between the filter and the polarised light.  [LCD displays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD), such as on your phone, also work on the concept of polarised light (surprise!). The display includes two filters at right angles to each other, and any light that passes through one won't pass through the other (as horizontally polarised light has no vertical component, and has a zero chance of passing through a vertical filter). However, between the two filters is the ""liquid crystal"", which will change polarisation when an electric field is applied - through technomagic‚Ñ¢, you can apply a different field to each pixel on the liquid crystal, and alter its polarisation axis to, say, ""diagonal"". You can then turn your horizontal light to diagonal, and then change that to vertical. By altering the actual angle the crystal's polarisation, you can affect how bright the pixel appears - if it's only just off from horizontal, most of the slightly-diagonal light will be blocked by the vertical filter, and the pixel will appear dim.  The reason the LCD display appears weird is that, once again, it is outputting polarised light. I've spent a few too many hours amusing myself with polarised filters and LCD displays.  One other common use of polarisers is in 3D glasses - light for the left eye is polarised one way, and light for the right the other way, and the lenses on the glasses make sure each eye only sees what it should. The reason you can see both left/right parts without the glasses is because your eye doesn't care about polarised light at all, and sees all polarisations equally.  (Hopefully any of that made sense!)",‚Ñ¢

In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete.  No word on Digital Versions yet, The Last of Us was published by Sony, hence why it was on the PS Store, GTA V is published by Take Two so it's up to them if they want to released a download version, and they haven't announced anything yet.",¬Æ

t5_2qh1i,Penguina1036,1374020968,"3 months ago my boyfriend, *dumbshit*, of over 3 years broke up with me. I was handling all of that fine until i found out this past Friday that a different ex boyfriend of mine committed suicide.   After my break up with the boyfriend of 3 years, I got together with the ex before him to see how he was doing. It wasn't my first time seeing him since we had broken up but it had been a while. At this meet-up, he strangely apologized for all of the mean and bad things he had done to me during our relationship. I apologized for everything I had done to him as well. He asked me if we could ever try again. I knew I still loved him but I had just been dumped a week before, so I told him I didn't know but I knew I wasn't ready for a relationship at the moment. He was acting a bit weird and admitted that he wanted to see how I would react. I gave him one of the biggest hugs ever. After that I tried talking with him through text messages, i asked him a few times to hang out but eventually he stopped replying. One of the last messages I received from him was that it wasn't personal, just that he wasn't much of a texter.  I understood, but was upset.   I found out through a friend about his death. I couldn't sleep at all that night. I attended his funeral the next day where I saw his family for the first time in a few years. When I saw his mom a memory of my ex telling me that his mom had said... ""Friends don't kiss."" We were ""friends"" after we first broke up but We obviously still loved each other and couldn't help but still kiss. The day after his funeral, they claim he committed suicide.   I was his first girlfriend, his first kiss, his first love. I have so many memories of him. My prom date, he was there for me when I graduated high school. I wish I had more time with him! He was a great guy! He was so smart, he could of had any type of future that he wanted. We could of had a wonderful future together...   One of the best memories I have of him is a time when we were not together. We spent hours and hours on the phone talking about all of the great memories we made together. The time when he sprinted to my house in the middle of the night to apologize for a silly argument. The time I picked him up from school during a flash flood.. We went to a park and ran around in the rain until we saw and heard lightening and thunder. He knew one of my favorite things was to kiss in the rain, so he kept kissing me. Everything I think about now just seems so magical. Among other memories, I knew he was happy when we were together.   I cannot fathom why he did this to himself. He put himself through so much pain... I wish he would have reached out to me or to anyone. I love him so much and wish he knew what he meant to me. I never knew he was in a bad place. I didn't know he couldn't handle what his life was.   What if I had said yes to him when we met up again.. Would he be alive right now? Terrible thoughts to think about.   I am so thankful for my break up with the last ex, because if it hadn't have happened I wouldn't have seen the previous ex and  I wouldn't have known his true feelings about me.    By now, the break up from my last ex seems completely irrelevant to my current emotions.  But he has a way of sticking his head where it doesn't belong.... His current girlfriend (one of his ex girlfriends) is messaging me through Facebook like the idiot that she is. I have never met her, but I heard stories about her from *dumbshit*. She just turned 21 and has a two year old baby from a fling.. When that guy left her she asked *dumbshit* (my bf of a year at that time) if he would be her ""baby daddy"". The two of them never had sex and were not together, so the baby was not *dumbshit*s.   At the same time I heard that the death was a suicide, this crazy girl messages me this:  ""Hey I just thanks for my baby dad back now were a family üòä""  When I didn't answer her, her next ploy to irk me was:   ""In case u don't know who I'm talking about I'm talking about *dumbshit*""  I never replied to her, and hope she realizes how rude and immature she is.   I'm not a terrible person! When she asked *dumbshit* to be her ""baby daddy"" when he was with me, I did not bitch at her or get in her face about that. When she was texting *dumbshit* while I was dating him I did not complain.    Her Facebook status shows that she is engaged to some other guy. But clearly she is dating *dumbshit*.  It's so confusing and a waste of my time, but I cannot help but feel betrayed by a person who I gave everything to.   The two of them deserve each other! They are obviously very immature. Again you don't see me giving her shit about her talking to me. You don't see me having my boyfriend get in their faces. But I am sharing my story to blow off steam, to not explode from all the emotions, to not give in to petty drama, to try to move forward. I'm talking with family, some friends and my boyfriend. Who have all been so great to me.   In short, Got dumped by text message, another ex committed suicide, last ex's gf is messaging me, trying to get under my skin.  So much sadness... Fuck 2013.

t5_2sfm9,fruitlewps,1374021366,"Press Release Text:  July 16, 2013, Mt. Laurel, NJ: Dynamite Entertainment proudly announces that they have acquired the rights to publish comic books based on the beloved science fiction anime, Robotech¬Æ. In a unique sub-licensing arrangement with DC Entertainment and with Harmony Gold USA, Dynamite Entertainment will publish a new series beginning with a Robotech / Voltron crossover event. This crossover marks the first time uniting the popular Robotech cast with the five lions of Voltron, a fan-favorite World Events Production property.  The Robotech series debuted in 1985, an adaptation combining concepts from three Japanese anime series (Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Genesis Climber Mospeada, and Super Dimension Century Southern Cross) into a new, cohesive narrative. It followed three generations of Earth soldiers who salvaged and repurposed alien technology in combat against consecutive extraterrestrial invasions, and was animated by the renowned animation studio Tatsunoko Production Co.  Voltron, based on the story of five robotic lions piloted by a team of brave space explorers that combine to form a mighty metallic hero, launched in the U.S. in September of 1984 and quickly became a #1 rated animated series that will celebrate its 30th Anniversary in 2014.  ""Robotech and Voltron are two of the most recognizable anime series that defined '80s pop culture,"" says Tommy Yune, creative director at Harmony Gold and mastermind behind the upcoming crossover. ""Both franchises have endured in their popularity today and fans have long speculated of an epic crossover between the universes. The opportunity to do so is an honor, and it's a welcome challenge to construct a storyline that works well with key characters on both sides. Most important of all, it's going to be a lot of fun with plenty of surprises.""  ""Robotech is one of the finest intellectual properties ever to come out of Japan, and we are so very fortunate to be able to contribute to its legacy of thrilling science fiction action and drama,"" says Nick Barrucci, CEO/Publisher of Dynamite Entertainment. ""We're also thankful to have such great partners on theRobotech journey, DC Comics and Harmony Gold, and joining us in this incredible first-ever crossover with Classic Media's Voltron. We've published Voltronfor years, and this is definitely rewarding to place the two fan-favorite universes together.""  ""Skyscraper-sized robots and city-crushing monsters are no strangers to the Dynamite gang, thanks to our fine experience with the Voltron license,"" adds Barrucci. ""We've been the proud home to Voltron since 2011, and I think our talented creators and editorial staff really balanced the science fiction and space fantasy elements of that franchise with the human story of its pilots. We're very excited to continue the adventures of the Five Lions and the Voltron Force pilots as part of the crossover penned by Tommy Yune, and recapture the very best qualities of our previous Voltron series in this exciting new venture. Robotech /Voltron is a fan's dream, one we're thrilled to add to our line of comics!""  The new Robotech / Voltron team-up adds additional content to Dynamite's existing Voltron projects, published as two series thus far and expanding the mythos licensed from World Events Productions. The first-ever pairing of these two giant animated properties is expected to attract huge media and fan attention in time for Voltron's 30th Anniversary. A new Robotech series will follow in the wake of the crossover.  The appreciation for the original Robotech television series, its comic spin-offs, and expansive universe of additional content runs deep at Dynamite, as evidenced by the passionate reflections of Joe Rybandt, the company's Senior Editor. ""Every day after school, I would watch Robotech and I loved it. LOVED IT. Probably for a lot of the same reasons that I loved Claremont's Uncanny X-Men, in that it was soap opera mixed with incredible action and excitement. Also, it was my first introduction to episodic television starring giant robots and, y'know, GIANT ROBOTS. I've gone back to the show every now and again, and still find it a rewarding experience, filled with great characters and amazing design. And now, here I sit, getting ready to set a new course with the comics."" ",¬Æ

t5_2cneq,gruntznclickz,1374023839,"&gt; we ARE in a war  What war? War on Terror^¬Æ ? We are in Afghanistan, supposedly to get Osama, which he's been dead for how long now? We've killed the ""number 2 and 3 al Qaeda members"" how many times? The fact is, as long as you are putting foreign troops on any land and killing their people you will continue to get resistance. It will *never end*.   ""Save the jobs"" is frankly a terrible reason to continue this bullshit. Just because they have security clearances does not mean they have to be using them for their jobs continuously. I'm not a person who thinks that governments are useless. They can create and bolster the economy but we need to be spending money on roads, infrastructure, mass transit, etc at home, not abroad. How great would it be for the economy if instead of giving corporate welfare to ""defense"" (offense) companies we brought those people home and gave them good paying jobs building and servicing our own country? Fuck, it'd be a new golden age. Instead, we ship our wealth to the middle east just trying to buy allegiance from foreigners by building them all the shit we need here. ",¬Æ

t5_2ss9z,i_drah_zua,1374026034,"I wrote a direct translation, but that was already done by /u/Munichx, so I present to you:  --- **The Archaic German Banning and Expulsion Exclamation Konstruction Kit‚Ñ¢ Lite!**    \*May cause unintentional banishing of pets and/or nearby bystanders to the lower circles of the underworld. Use at own risk.    === 1\. **For the initial request to leave, use any of those carefully selected expletives:**   ""Hinfort"" (Away (archaic))   ""Hinweg"" (Away (archaic))   ""Weiche"" (Begone!)   ""Verschwinde"" (Go away!)   ""Hau ab"" (Go away!)   ""Ziehe von dannen"" (""go forth!"")    Full version teaser: In front of hinweg or hinfort you could also write a ""Eile"" (haste!), so it would be ""Eile hinfort"".  (Haste away)    ===   2\. **Now you must add a comma! Or else!**    No really, if you do not do this, the banishment will fall back to yourself. At least I hope it does.    ===   3\. **Optional: Write a ""du"" (you) to personalise the request for solitude**   This should remove most, if not all, doubts as to whom it is directed to.    ===   4\. **Pick an adjective from that exhaustive list, to further your statement of bodily removal:**   ""unheilige"" (unholy)   ""gottlose"" (godless)   ""gottesl√§sterliche"" (profane, lit. ""god-blaspheming"")   ""niedertr√§chtige"" (dastardly)   ""verachtenswerte"" (contemptible)   ""teuflische"" (fiendish / devilish)   ""hinterh√§ltige"" (underhanded/malicious)   ""gr√§ssliche"" or ""grausige"" (ghastly)   ""f√ºrchterliche"" or ""furchtbare"" (horrible)   ""entsetzliche"" (appalling)   ""scheu√üliche"" (heinous)   ""abscheuliche"" (abominable)   ""absto√üende"" (repugnant)   ""widerw√§rtige"" (vile)    === 5\. **with any of these Nouns:**   ""Kreatur"" (creature)   ""Gestalt"" (guise)   ""Ungestalt"" (Hard to translate this one. A misformed figure, but more. A bit like monstrosity.)   ""Monstrosit√§t"" (monstrosity)   ""Widerw√§rtigkeit"" (vileness)   ""Scheu√ülichkeit"" (heinousness)   ""Abscheulichkeit"" (abomination)   ""Gr√§sslichkeit"" (hideousness)   ""Unget√ºm"" or ""Monster"" (monster, with these you have add an ""s"" to the end of the previous adjectives! e.g. ""unheiliges"")   ""Monstrum"" (monstrosity/monster, for big pets only, lest you look silly! Here too add an ""s"" to the adjective.)    ===   6\. **At last, you can add as many exclamation marks as you see fit to accomplish the task of sending your pet into to the circles of hell.**   Or the back yard, whatever's closer at the time.    --- &amp;nbsp;    So if you are searching for the most overdone sentence, you probably should go for:   ""Ziehe von dannen, du gottesl√§sterliche Widerw√§rtigkeit!""     This is of course the Lite version, the full version with much more vocabulary and sentence structures [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German).    If you have any questions about pronunciation, don't hesitate to ask!   Of course I can and will not guarantee an answer, I'm going to bed, like I should have done hours before I even started this comment.    EDIT: Now with more choice!    No, I lied, having the choice is not an option.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2uhpg,Cackfiend,1374035907,"&gt; I'm rather confused by your first section. You say you dislike the idea of limiting certain affixes to certain slots, but then you want them to add a new slot specifically for one affix. Personally, once I figured out where each affix goes, I didn't mind the current system, because it reduces randomness by limiting where a particular affix can go. This makes finding a ""perfect"" piece a lot easier.  **correct. like the person i quoted points out, having MF on items that are used for combat as well makes it so when you find that amazing combat gear peace you tend to never even use it because it doesnt have MF on it. example; i have a helmet with 8% crit, 15% attackspeed and +3 to a good skill. I almost aways use a crappy 15% rarity helmet instead.**  **a new exclusive slot for rarity/sif/credit/xp would free up combat gear to keep being amazing and not have to worry about it having MF stats. think about it, it would be awesome.**  &gt; Letting us choose which affix to roll for on the costumes is a terrible idea. The point of the costume affixes is to be a money sink. Allowing us to reduce the randomness, even a little, would lessen the purpose of the system. I do, however, completely agree that the crappy Affixes should either be revisited or removed entirely.   **terrible idea? have you actually tried to get good affixes on a costume yet? its a pretty terrible system. you can spend 100k's and still not get a decent roll on the stat you want, and thats just rank 1 and 2, id hate to try for r3 and 4. keeping the random number pool but pick which affix u get is still plenty of a money sink.**  &gt; +1 to all skills is currently an affix, it's just limited to Cosmic rarity items. Life Leech, Spirit Leech (omg yes please), and more, unique procs would be very welcome. Maybe not so much on the +1 Attribute affix though. More costumes cores are definitely something I wouldn't complain about either, and you've listed some pretty decent ones.  **I think limiting +1 to all skills to just cosmics is a big mistake as it should have been the progressive stat to be on high ilvl gear. +1 attribute should be on some of the best gear that is still to come.**  &gt; I'd just like to point out that D2 didn't launch with runewords. D2 also had its fair share of crap affixes as well. It wasn't until patch 1.07 that they had more than five hotkeys as well, though, that's more to the people who (rightfully) complain about how little skill space there is.  **People always seem to want to point out how crappy D2 was when it launched and I don't understand why. It came out in what, 2001? We have learned an awful lot about ARPGs since then. Saying that MH's item system in its current state is ok because D2's item system was bad when it came out is not a good argument.**   &gt; I'd rather we only have one ""artifact"" slot, and add a Ring, Necklace and one other ""Accessory"" slot. Move the current artifacts into the appropriate groups, make new items with interesting effects, profit. Also, I'm sure I read that Uniques are coming, and soon‚Ñ¢, but I haven't heard anything about set items, and I would enjoy those as well.  **We are getting 4 artifact slots soon actually =D now if only there were more artifacts actually worth using**  &gt; The item upgrade system is meant to drain credits from you, same as the costume affixes. It's meant to be MH's version of Gheed, essentially. As for the next point, it's possible that one of two things is happening. You are legitimately getting one bonus affix, or you're actually getting two, but one is rolling into a pre-existing affix. There are a few topics around here and on the official forums about ""double upping"" on certain affixes via lucky upgrade rolls.  **im aware of double affixes and that is not what im talking about. When you upgrade a blue and get +2 to a skill you'll know what im talking about. this game has too many money sinks for how hard it is to get money and 100k to upgrade high level items is a bit ridiculous when you might only get 1 affix more**  &gt; Anyway, all in all a solid, thought out post. I don't agree with you on all the topics listed, but such is life. Just try to remember that MH is still in infancy. Diablo 2 didn't become the crowned king of ARPGs right at launch, and Diablo 3 is STILL fucked, a full year after its launch. The team at Gaz has been improving, showing attentiveness, and listening to feedback, so I have high hopes for the future of the game.  **my feelings with MH were that the item system should have shipped with at-minimum the quality of D2's item system. the result is epic disappointment. Gaz is improving and updating like crazy though, so there is a ton of hope in the future. This game should be completely different in 6 months**",‚Ñ¢

t5_2snuc,TryptamineX,1374051465,"&gt; Not doing something is an act just as much as doing something - it's the act of doing something else. You walk past a church - walking on rather than going in is a decision. You decide the priorities of your everyday life are more important than the possibility of spiritual salvation.   I'm not denying any of that. I'm saying that a lack of belief in spiritual salvation is just as sufficient to motivate me to choose to not pursue it than an active disbelief in it.  &gt;You may not have thought about it much, but that, I'd say, is because you've internalised the notion that ""this spiritual salvation stuff is almost certainly complete bunk"".  Or it's because I lack reason to currently believe that there's anything to gain from the various theistic traditions presented to me.  &gt;So do you similarly lack a motivation to avoid going to church?  No, I have all kinds of motivations to avoid going to church. I could sleep in, get shopping done, or do countless other things that I have reason to believe would benefit me.  &gt; This all requires a determination that ""this is less important than other things I could be doing otherwise"", which requires an opinon on it.  I've never denied having opinions about theism. As I've noted before, I'm happy to argue that lack of belief is a more justifiable stance and to base my actions accordingly.  &gt;What do you mean by ""take"" here. Isn't it just ""consider to be correct"", which makes these equivalent?   No, I am not just using it as ""consider it to be correct."" You could potentially say that I consider agnosticism to be correct, but it doesn't work for soft atheism.  First off, it's not a claim that could be correct. It's the refusal to accept a claim. That's why I chose the language of a stance; it can be conceived of as a position in a matrix of (a)gnostic (a)theism, but doesn't actually advance a true/false metaphysical claim.  Second, I lean towards something like Karl Popper's idea of falsifiable conjectures than more traditional accounts of justified knowledge. Rather than seeing science as a method of observing and inducing to justify knowledge, Popper saw it as a way of subjecting falsifiable conjectures to scrutiny. That process doesn't leave us with justified knowledge, but with conjectures which have survived more or less scrutiny and can thus be said to have more or less verisimilitude. When it does come to positive claims I'm a lot happier with saying that I have a conjecture I'm justified to work with than claiming that I have a justified, true belief.   &gt;Do you know if the earth is non-flat? If not, would you claim to know anything?  When it comes to formal, epistemological discussions rather than colloquial usage I'm hesitant to advance knowledge claim about anything, including whether or not I know things.  &gt;If so, do you accept that there's a possibility of being wrong (surely a God could fool the evidence you see, which means a possibility of such a God means a possibility of being wrong here). So what's different? If the existence of a God who could make you think a flat earth was non-flat is a possibility, then the probability that the earth is non-flat is constrained by the possibility of such a God who is doing so. You need to assign a low likelihood to that god to assign a high likelihood to ""non-flat earth"".  This is a good example of why I would prefer to say that a particular conjecture seems to have survived more or less attempts to falsify it than say that a particular claim about reality‚Ñ¢ is more or less likely to be true.  &gt;Why use the word in a way so alien to the way everyone else uses it?  True, justified belief is a pretty common definition for knowledge in epistemological contexts and I'm far from the first to suggest that we lack sufficient justification.  &gt;The point is that you dont' though, without requiring further information. Getting a ""weak atheist"" description tells you very little about some very relevant factors the other person believes.  I'm not sure what you mean. Identifying as an (a)gnostic (weak/strong) (a)theist *necessarily* distinguishes whether or not you have or lack belief in the both existence of gods and the non-existence of gods in my schema without relying on any further information.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2uo3q,uriahsw,1374061219,"While I think they might be using indexing more than I originally believed, I still think that it's using active management. The wording suggest at the least that it's an [enhanced index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_indexing). Which is a type of index which is at least a little actively managed.  The link to ""optimised index portfolios"" doesn't add much clarity on whether or not it's enhanced, as they say *""Optimisation takes a large number of factors into account, including the financial characteristics of securities in the index and the correlation in behaviour between stocks""*. Now the correlation is fine, but depending on what all the other factors are, and how they're used, they're definitely making some sort of judgement.  Where does it say that the ASX300 portion is passively managed? I couldn't find that, and [specifically googling their whole site](http://goo.gl/3tPl6) for it only returned references to arguments for passive vs active.  I mean, there's no way it's 100% passive straight off the bat, because the fund itself says... &gt; The Vanguard¬Æ LifeStrategy¬Æ Growth Fund is biased towards growth assets  And there's no way to do that without SOME active management. I mean, it might be entirely computer automated, but they're still making value judgements in those computer models, over whether or not this is a growth asset or not.  In fact, the [fact sheet on their website](https://static.vgcontent.info/crp/intl/auw/docs/funds/factsheets/ret/vlsgf.pdf?20130715|092300) suggests that 70% of this funds assets are ""Growth assets"". (You can find the link to it [here](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/funddetailGRO.jsp) on the bottom left hand corner of the screen. It says ""Download a fund factsheet"".)  I really don't think this is a passive fund.  Someone should call them up and ask? Maybe see if they'll come on here and clear it up for us?",¬Æ

t5_2qn5f,Xirious,1374066515,"Thank you for this! This is EXACTLY what I was looking for and I'm going to create a few extra accounts just to upvote you :P   I am just going to affirm which ones I think you hit the nail on the head:  1993 - Orcish Oriflame would be actually quite cool with new art.   1994 - I've heard talk on mtgsalvation forums that Statis is a heavy contender so I completely agree with you.   1995 - If its a foil Dark Ritual (with or without new art) I would be very happy. Extremely iconic card for most of magic and one of B's postercards.   1996 - Land tax is a push and Blinking Spirit seems plausible except its a  bit meh. We can hope for the former though :)  1997 - (The year I started playing). Gemstone mine was in timeshifted so completely plausible and wouldn't be too bad a card to have foily of.   1998 - Exodus. One of my favourite sets... Reflecting pool was also mentioned somewhere (I think) so spot on with that one.   1999 - I bought two of the Kai Budde's Wildfire decks since then and I can guarentee if it weren't for Cursed Scroll being on the RL then we'd get that... but it is and I'm thinking Wildfire is the safest bet but I'd love a new art Thran Dynamo too.  2000 - Pity Tinkers already been in a FTV. Brainstorm is an obvious choice for WotC in this year.   2001 - Didn't like MM too much myself but Rishadan Port was awesome. Kinda a flatish period in magic to be sure (thanks Urza Block ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§)   2002 - Definately going to print Psychatog. No other choice really.  2003 - Wrath makes sense and is very iconic so I'm going with that.  2004 - Didn't really play this year but either of those look pretty good leaning towards Eternal for me.  2005 - If not for value I'd go with Jitte. He hasn't seen a reprint, super iconic for the time and well I want another one.  2006 - Dragonstorm was in MMA so probably not... The dragon is more likely though.   2007 - Well I highly doubt that TS would be printed in a limited collection such as FTV because its a modern staple and well WotC is pushing modern. Doran would be awesome if he wasn't already in FTV:Legends making him pretty unlikely :(  2008 - I would LOVE bitterblossom but its gonna be something else. Will be fairies though.   2009 - Also took a break for this year and Baneslayer Angel is good but Bloodbraid Elf is more likely IMO.  2010 - Another good reply above was Stoneforge Mystic. Just as iconic of the time and doesn't seem TOO far fetched to get a reprint.   2011 - My vote for Primeval Titan. Mainly because well it was around for ages everywhere (Valakut and him were ""EVAL"") but also because I want one.   2012 - Snapcaster no and a sword wouldn't be too far fetched. If its delver I'll be a little sad (seen enough of him thank you).  This set is either going be awesome and worth a ton or awesome and worth a little less than a ton. Basically its a definite buy for me.",‚ù§

t5_2upjd,electrophile91,1374067717,"It's really vapor resin. Though it will start to contain some impurities at higher temperatures. *(and also what device you're using!)*   You can tell by looking at the resin build up, which is clear and honey coloured. The fact that it is clear means that there aren't enough solid particulates to scatter light - which would make it opaque.At higher temperatures the resin will contain some impurities associated with smoke. Notably the carcinogenic family of molecules: PAH's (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) as well as sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Judging by the smell and appearance of most resin's that I've seen I don't think they are ever really at any considerable concentration. Compare vapor resin to smoke resin, and you'll see what I mean.    There is a study somewhere which talks about the constituents of cannabis vapor, I'll try and look for it...   edit: http://www.canorml.org/healthfacts/Second-Study-Shows-Vaporizers-Drastically-Reduce-Toxins-in-Marijuana-Smoke  &gt;The new study used a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) to examine the gas components of the vapor. The analysis showed that the Volcano¬Æ vapor was remarkably clean, consisting 95% of THC with traces of cannabinol (CBN), another cannabinoid. The remaining 5% consisted of small amounts of three other components: one suspected cannabinoid relative, one suspected PAH, and caryophyllene, a fragrant oil in cannabis and other plants. In contrast over 111 different components appeared in the gas of the combusted smoke, including a half dozen known PAHs. Non-cannabinoids accounted for as much as 88% of the total gas content of the smoke.",¬Æ

Yup, hold on, I got this...  &gt; ...the Whovian Girl had revealed her Sook and it was well received. Random Internet Guy‚Ñ¢ (see what I did there?) did likewise, putting his [Mow Mow](http://i.imgur.com/fPa262H.jpg) on display for Whovian Girl's approval.  &gt; In celebration they danced around the fire like some kind wild of tribesmen who know little of the ""civilized"" world.  Many drums were played, hips were shaken, and bodies gyrated to the beat as others looked on. Their animated shadows were projected against the tree canopy beyond the perimeter by the fire doing a dance all its own.  &gt; Tired from their wild abandon, the Whovian Girl and Random Internet Guy‚Ñ¢ withdrew from their spectacle to a more secluded spot with large green leaves whereupon they were served fruity rum drinks - the kind with the colorful paper umbrella stuck in the top. They also had cool sunglasses on, despite it being a beautiful jungle night under the stars. They sipped their drinks and relaxed in comfortable silence for a bit. Waves were lapping at the beach.  &gt; Maybe it was the rum or perhaps it was the dancing... she wasn't sure. Whovian girl couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she was becoming keenly aware of a sort of electric energy coming over her. It was at once energizing, but also relaxing. It was the sort of sensation that's difficult to put into words, but you know it when you feel it.  &gt; The Whovian Girl leaned in closely to Random Internet Guy‚Ñ¢. Her eyes sparkled with the nervous electric energy as traces of the distant fire reflected on her sunglasses and danced across her cheeks.  &gt; ""Want to know a secret?"" she asked.  &gt; ""Tell me."" he replied.*  *To be continued*...

With his huge cock.  His huge, huge cock.  So huge that she is scared of it, your mom in character as this 21 year old girl. The girl whom she is pretending to be while she is flicking her middle-aged bean is younger than you.  She is younger than your younger sister.  She is a mere four years older than you were when your mom would have been horrified to find a pack of purloined Virginia Slims crumpled up in your Levis when she was doing your laundry.  Right now your mom is pretending to be a girl who literally just turned old enough to drink, who meets a notorious but reclusive billionaire ‚Äúindustrialist‚Äù who made huge sums of money in the way that women think ‚Äúindustrialists‚Äù make money, which is: they don‚Äôt know, so he just owns a bunch of factories where things are made by hand right here in the good old U S of A and a bunch of farms where man and beast alike are treated ethically and humanely.  When asked about his massive hoard of non-inherited money bootstrapped from nothing with the sweat of his brow the man, who is under thirty, speaks of how he ‚Äúknows people‚Äù and the key is his forty thousand employees, all of whom he has hand-selected and pays what they‚Äôre worth and listens to their ideas and etc., even though his army of hot young blonde secretaries are terrified of him.  The girl had to interview him for the school paper when her cub journalist roommate got sick, and then he tracked her down and made the girl his fuckslave.  So she is thinking about being quasi-forcibly penetrated with this man‚Äôs impossibly generous and perfectly complected cock, your mom.  A cock which is stretching her 21 year old butterscotch tasting pussy that even though said pussy has drunk deeply of this same member on a few prior occasions, this bone-white and rigid member is so impossibly huge that it still manages to push her open and stretch and sting. And yet somehow it miraculously fits, inside your mom.  [Who had hoped to have a sort of luxurious drawn out teasing period with the tip of her index finger on her mons pubis and outer labia before going whole hog with the Rabbit‚Ñ¢ but the thought of his hot breath on her neck as he leaned on her and pushed her gagged face into the mattress was just too hot and she just plunged the whirring churning rotating rabbit inside her right up to the hilt and came instantly like a volcano; she couldn‚Äôt help herself.

t5_2tg71,TheDemonClown,1374085308,"Jacen Solo.  Both before &amp; after his turn into Darth Caedus.  In the Young Jedi Knights books that I read back in the day, he was so corny &amp; cheesy that I couldn't help but laugh.  As he grew up &amp; got more serious during the New Jedi Order, all culminating in what he went through in ""Traitor"", I was like, ""Well, that's it - he's my favorite character now"".  My biggest problem with Star Wars, and a lot of the older franchises in genre fiction (looking at you, X-Men), is that they're afraid to really *go there*, you know?  The world is a very ugly place, yet all these stories give us is canned happy endings &amp; false tension.  I get that entertainment is an escape, but I still want to see happy endings be earned &amp; for the characters I love to have to go through hardships.  Maybe I'm weird, but it helps me relate to them, which is a big part of why I like the Song Of Ice &amp; Fire series.  Back to the point, though...Jacen's experiences sort of exemplify the point of the New Jedi Order to me.  Not just that arc, but the order itself.  They're going to have to do things much differently from the way the old Jedi did it, or else they're going to meet the same fate.  The Yuuzhan Vong might be the most *alien* threat they'll ever have to face, but they damn sure won't be the last threat, nor may they even be proved to have been the most dangerous.  The old dogmatic view of the Force has always seemed a little off; Vergere's view of things, of the Force being ""the battleground on which good &amp; evil fight"", seems much more appropriate, and that's how the Jedi are going to have to work with it.  Using Force lightning doesn't make you bad - it's all in what you're using it for.  The spark is just a tool.  When Legacy Of The Force came around &amp; Jacen started to turn...man, it was heartbreaking to watch.  Especially in the final book of that series, ""Invincible"".  Every chapter started with a cheesy Jacen Joke‚Ñ¢ from his Young Jedi Knights days, which made each chapter a fresh punch in the gut, because you knew exactly what had to happen.  But, in a weird way, I got it.  I'd kind of gone through something similar when I was younger.  When your worldview is brutally shattered the way Jacen's had been, when you see just how ugly humanity can be, you do kind of go a little mad.  I've always said there's no worse villain than a ruined idealist, and Jacen's a prime example.  He wanted the galaxy to come together &amp; everything to be safe, especially two certain girls, but you can see on every step of the way from Yuuzhan'tar to Darth Caedus that he's kind of driven by the urge to inflict the pain of his madness on everyone who crosses him.  Noble goal, ignoble means.  It really makes you question things, especially since the Galactic Alliance &amp; the Empire ultimately did come together into 1 unified government in the wake of his campaign.  **TL;DR** Jacen Solo, because he's a wonderfully complex character that I really relate to.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh1i,RecycledEternity,1374085384,"Hm. This is a situation unique from what I had in mind (if the two bros in question are friends in a social setting other than a bar or club). It was implied that these two knew each other enough to the point where the sexual history of each was somewhat known between them.  If these are two stranger bros in a bar (or club), and you strike out with a lady, you are not entitled to cockblock any other man attempting to entice aforementioned lady.  Now, let's say it's you and a fellow bro, at a bar. You take a crack at one lady, and she shoots you down. Your fellow bro, you know, has a history of being wonderful with words on women--and as such, has quite the record of being a man-whore. Do you cockblock? No. But! If this bro was a True Bro‚Ñ¢, he would have been *helping you out* in the *first place*. A True Bro‚Ñ¢ does this. Only a douchebag would see his friend struggle, strike out, and swoop in for his own selfish chance. He is no bro. If, however, he does not help out--say, he's indisposed, and/or drinking--and you strike out anyway, then it's anyone's game. You, having struck out, are not entitled to your cockblocking of any nature on that woman: playing the ""scorched earth"" policy is the policy you're thinking of, sir, to which I must protest against it's use.

t5_2to85,Draconics,1374098527,"*NOTE: Once again, the newest season comes at an extremely inconvenient time for me, as I am currently busy moving in for college. Regardless, I feel like I‚Äôd absolutely be dropping the ball if I even dared to not do these rankings in the very middle of summer. I might end up hauling around my laptop while I‚Äôm getting situated, but anything to maintain the consistency of my rankings.*  *NOTE 2: I‚Äôm also in the middle of another, power ranking related project that will have to be put on hold until I‚Äôm finished moving in and this season is over.*  *NOTE 3: There was no prediction thread this time around (which I prefer posting these on), so I'm posting them here instead.*  **HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, Etho overslept, Beef got onto his worst start without dying since Season 3, and SethBling pulled what some may be calling an ‚ÄúAnderz‚Äù by killing Pakratt in the first episode, and team NoBeef had multiple near-death experiences. Last episode was great, and I‚Äôm sure that everyone is excited for S12E1 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**WolfPack** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I already had these guys as the number 1 ranked team as soon as I saw the team members. Out of all 8 teams, I feel like WolfPack will easily have the best teamwork. I imagine that this will almost be like Team Europe in S7 (Strategy of Doc, Luck of Anderz‚Äîonly hopefully without the bad luck of encountering Pause immediately after getting extremely well geared), especially considering Guude‚Äôs lack of luck last season in getting diamonds, and Anderz notoriously excellent luck in finding valuables. Add on top of that the fact that they worked excellently in the first episode, as well as being  the only team that retained full health, and you have an excellent team.  *How Can They Improve?*: As long as the 2 of them do what they‚Äôre both well known for, all that they need to improve on is making sure that Anderz doesn‚Äôt hate Guude for last season.  *Season Outlook*: Hard to say so early on, but with an excellent team like theirs, and being off to a fine start, I wouldn‚Äôt be betting against them just yet.  2	**Brewski** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Despite Pause losing quite a bit of health, a dominant PvPer and a lucky guy like Pyro on this team still makes them a fine bet, especially considering they‚Äôve worked together in the past. The last time I doubted Pause after losing a significant amount of health, he pulled off what I consider to be the greatest upset of all UHC time. Besides, Pyro is actually quite good at finding resources. As long as Pause is alive, this team should be feared.   *How Can They Improve?*: Pyro can likely help Pause recover the lost health‚Äîthat is the most critical thing that they must do (aside from getting him a bow).   *Season Outlook*: A slow start, but I feel like I‚Äôd regret it if I put Pause lower. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Pyro quickly helped Pause recover the lost health, and put them in an excellent position.   3	**Mongooses** (No Movement)  *Why?*: They had a pretty standard beginning (aside from the Kurtain actually taking a fair chunk of early damage), so their standing will have to be judged based off of how I predict these 2 will fare together. While they possess more health than Brewski, who is ranked ahead of them, what you have in Kurt and Baj are 2 players that are more weighted towards the PvE aspect of things. Kurt is as good as they come in PvE (though he did take early damage), and Baj is quite underrated in terms of his ability.    *How Can They Improve?*: Continue to be one of the only teams that have remained relatively safe from mobs, and continue to gear up efficiently and effectively.  *Season Outlook*: As usual with Kurt, good (but it could be better).   4       **Germinators** (No Movement)  *Why?*: This is a very calm and careful team, and I don‚Äôt anticipate either of them taking a huge amount of PvE damage, especially with JL almost holding Doc back from being too reckless. However, I don‚Äôt know about either of them in terms of PvP (Doc in that I think he‚Äôs an average PvPer at best, and JL in that I have no idea if he‚Äôs good at PvP). JL is a wild card in that we‚Äôve never seen him play UHC before,  and he seems to be a very calm player at that.   *How Can They Improve?*: Keep playing carefully like this and avoid damage. Everyone (except for a couple teams) are getting killed by mobs, and it will be extremely beneficial to them if they continue playing like this and avoiding damage.  *Season Outlook*: I anticipate a top half finish, barring any PvP action.  5	**Red Shirt**(No Movement)  *Why?*: Early aggression cost these guys (Seth) quite a bit of health, but they‚Äôve been doing fine at PvE (the only health lost being a skeleton arrow). BlameTC may end up actually needing to find gold in order to have a chance to win this season, however.  *How Can They Improve?*: Fighting with Pakratt, in my opinion, wasn‚Äôt a great choice. Seth ended up fleeing the village immediately, and he really didn‚Äôt gain much in terms of resources and valuables. As a result of that, they must get into gold finding mode.  *Season Outlook*: Still early, but unrewarding early aggression may have cost them greatly.  6	**NoBeef** (No Movement)  *Why?*: I‚Äôm legitimately very surprised that the ~~pear~~ pair of Jsano and Beef took so much damage in the first episode, particularly Beef as I see him as second only to the Kurtain in terms of PvE ability. After taking a massive amount of damage, the only thing keeping them out of the last 2 spots is that neither of them have died yet (considering that creeper, quite miraculously).   *How Can They Improve?*: As always, and as I‚Äôve said many times by now, they must recover, making that the highest priority. They seem to be interested in going to the Nether, which would help them greatly should they be successful. A relatively unorganized and damage-filled start like that will be difficult (6 golden apple difficult, to be precise) to recover from.  *Season Outlook*: Lowest it‚Äôs been for Beef after the first episode since Season 3. Of course, he got 3rd place that season.   7	**Lavatrap** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Just like anyone who loses their partner and a large amount of health in the first episode, Zisteau in trouble.   *How Can They Improve?*: I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that he play SkyBlock again, but he‚Äôs going to have to be smart while caving (no Zisteau, no killing yourself with lava again).   *Season Outlook*: Pretty bad. Our favorite zombie pigman is already at a huge disadvantage.  8	**White Rush‚Äôn** (No Movement)  *Why?*: Already by himself and near death, Avidya is already in a deep hole. Regardless, he has shown to be respectably good at PvE, so it‚Äôs not necessarily over for our lone ranger.   *How Can They Improve?*: He‚Äôs going to have to pull off an ‚ÄúMC‚Äù with an ‚ÄúAnderz‚Äù like recovery.   *Season Outlook*: Bleak, but it‚Äôs too early for it to be over. While an exit within the next episode or 2 for him wouldn‚Äôt be surprising, it‚Äôs not impossible for him to pull off an amazing comeback. He won‚Äôt need a miracle, per say, but he‚Äôs going to need quite a bit of gold.  *Writer‚Äôs Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2qh2p,bipolar_sky_fairy,1374107942,"&gt; Now who's going into semantics and ignoring the overall point :)  It was more of a tangent than a distraction, and the term ""circlejerk"" is highly related to r/atheism in particular.   &gt; Which is a more apt description than I ever could have attempted.  Ever wander into any religious subs? By their very nature they're pompous and self congratulatory, patting themselves on the back for having found THE TRUTH¬Æ and deriding others who will no doubt rot in hell for lack of belief.... and yet, not a peep is heard from the reddit community and *never* is the term circlejerk applied to them.   As for the rest:   &gt;  I'm atheist first and foremost and I also see and care about the things that are happening in the world in the name of religion. I believe it's as often a symptom as it is a cause though, and a tool rather than an instigator in wars, but I'm against religion and I think the world is better off without.  In my mind it's a tool.. a justification for horrors and abuses. The core problem is with our *species*.. half of us seem psychotic, reliant on the primitive hindbrains we haven't evolved away from, too prone to greed, jealousy, hoarding and other ancient impulses that  do not serve us in this day and age.   &gt; I get equally enraged when reading about stories of children not getting proper medical care because it's against the parent's views, about schools covering creationism as a fact, or even a choice and dozens of burqas I see every day on the street.  Ditto.  &gt; However.. subjectively.. whenever I hit /r/atheism, first on purpose, later by accident or when I get linked to a thread here... in general the circlejerk really just makes my stomach turn.  When I hit it, I see stories of children worried about the attitudes of their parents, of being disowned, made homeless. I see people enduring endless torment at school or having to keep their mouths shut at work, of having their property defaced or their personal safety threatened.   On top of that , so many questions.. why did you become atheist.. how do I come out to my parents about lack of belief, what do you think happens after you die.. and buried in all that are news articles about secular living and related topics.   Like every sub the easily digested fluff rises to the top.  &gt; I think /r/books is an excellent replacement. If everybody read a book the next time instead of choosing to vent about atheists or religious people, there would be no need for /r/atheism ;)  I'm currently going through God Emperor of Dune and enjoying the relationships of religion/prophet/destiny/government/genetic heritage.",¬Æ

t5_2qh6c,EarBucket,1374156946,"It's a shame, because up until that he's making some very insightful points. Then the last paragraph takes a hard right turn into ""Well, of *course* the Papists need all that nonsense; they don't have Real Biblical Truth‚Ñ¢ like we do!""  I think post-evangelical types are drawn to traditional liturgy and ritual because it's important and powerful and helpful. That's not to say it's essential; there are some people that it just doesn't speak to, and it makes sense for them to seek different forms of worship. But it's ungracious to look down on fellow Christians for worshipping ""in spirit and in truth,"" however weird it feels to you personally. Someone else's worship is between them and God, and the best way to argue for your own liturgy is to live like you believe it. I'm gonna drop another selection from *The Screwtape Letters here, chapter 16, because as always Lewis says it better than I can.  &gt;I think I warned you before that if your patient can't be kept out of the Church, he ought at least to be violently attached to some party within it. I don't mean on really doctrinal issues; about those, the more lukewarm he is the better. And it isn't the doctrines on which we chiefly depend for producing malice. The real fun is working up hatred between those who say ""mass"" and those who say ""holy communion"" when neither party could possibly state the difference between, say, Hooker's doctrine and Thomas Aquinas', in any form which would hold water for five minutes. And all the purely indifferent things - candles and clothes and what not - are an admirable ground for our activities. We have quite removed from men's minds what that pestilent fellow Paul used to teach about food and other unessentials - namely, that the human without scruples should always give in to the human with scruples. You would think they could not fail to see the application. You would expect to find the ""low"" churchman genuflecting and crossing himself lest the weak conscience of his ""high"" brother should be moved to irreverence, and the ""high"" one refraining from these exercises lest he should betray his ""low"" brother into idolatry. And so it would have been but for our ceaseless labour. Without that the variety of usage within the Church of England might have become a positive hotbed of charity and humility,",‚Ñ¢

It's this kind of corruption of the event that pains me. I talked to several artists last year that all complained that they would like to lower the price of their art; but have marked it up high consistently year after year as the price for booths increase due to the demand for space, which becomes more competitive with these bankrolled corporations now vying for space.  It drags the whole experience down, and will ultimately push some of the creative energies that make Art Fair a great experience for many generations out.

t5_2tnbv,SexyBearHugs,1374165184,"I find it funny, the ""stories"" we hear are no better then anecdotes. With a company as large as Best Buy and with the volume of customers they must deal with(millions?), something they are doing is either right or not as wrong as we may guess. Hundreds of complaints vs millions of customers isn't terrible ratio to have. Even the tech darling APPLE‚Ñ¢ has complaints.  It's like with any corporation really. I used to bash Walmart like crazy because of the low wages, job/industry killing practices but people continue to shop, work and patronize the business. (only game in town?)  It is the ultimate form of financial democracy. People vote with their wallets and the companies rise and fall based on that. We may not like it but ignoring reality isn't going to change it. Value is up to the individual and enough individuals are supporting Best Buy, Walmart, McDonald's etc. It is something we personally do not value but we are just the minority who know what the heck is going on. We may not agree on the ""Value‚Ñ¢"" of GS but we cant argue its sheer effectiveness of it.   So let's play a simple game of numbers. The number of techs they have would be thousands(5000) and lets assume that half wouldn't know a IEEE 1394 cable from desktop background. So that would leave 2500 morons and 2500 competent techs. I'm sure the good ones may leave, teach others, stay on for a career etc. Now the bad ones generally either wont stay bad forever or get kicked out for dumb mistakes. GS have been around for about a decade or so and generally speaking the number will start to shift to more competent techs. No successful business will keep money drainers around for very long and based on BBY‚Ñ¢ stock price they are making some money.  I can't agree with you enough about how little the people know themselves. That's how I make some extra scratch on the side. :D. I very rarely turn away tech business by telling customers they can fix things themselves and directing them to some obscure website for answers. Unless its a simple fix that would take me 2 minutes I charge for every instance because if I don't value my time who will?",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r0e3,luxienai,1374177351,"Info about the game here: www.ackkstudios.com    Two Brothers is an Action Adventure game that features a classic Gameboy aesthetic. ‚Äì Coming to PC, MAC, Linux, XBOX 360, and WII U.  Roy Guarder, inventor, scientist, and philosopher, is on an expedition to discover the origins of life. This quest has brought him to ‚ÄúThe Cursed Lands,‚Äù a stretch of land so dangerous and shrouded in mystery that it hasn‚Äôt been explored in over 700 years. When Roy finds what he‚Äôs looking for, he is met with a terrible fate. Roy no longer finds himself a living man. He is greeted with a world of colors he never believed could have existed! One obsession leads to another and Roy begins to walk the line of life and death ‚Äì sometimes intentionally ending his own life ‚Äì just so he can see this land of beauty and color again.  But something is strange: Why is Roy the only man who can cross so easily between the worlds of the living and the dead? What has given him this unique ability? How will he reconcile the existence of an afterlife he never believed could even exist?  ‚ñ™ Explore a vast non-linear world and story with multiple endings, and deep side quests!  ‚ñ™ Take the game world from black and white 8bit to full color 16bit!   What makes Two Brothers unique:  Two Brothers takes a long hard look at death in video games‚Ä¶ when the player is killed in combat or triggers a deadly trap, instead of being greeted a familiar GAMEOVER screen, the player finds himself in what we call the ‚ÄúAfterlife Hub‚Äù.  This realm of the dead is a colorful and mysterious place where the player can explore, find clues, and interact with characters who have passed on in the games story‚Ä¶ sometimes even bringing some of them back from the dead.  When the player wants to return to gameplay, they can jump from the edge of the heavens and get back in to the action and exploration!  This mechanic is vital to the gameplay, as sometimes interacting with the dead is just as important as interacting with the living‚Ä¶ this feature often requires the player intentionally ending their session in a game over, just to cross over to the other side.",‚ñ™

t5_2to85,Draconics,1374196231,"*NOTE: Now making a strong effort to have these done for the prediction thread.*  **HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, we laughed as some of the players committed some of the most hilarious mistakes in the history of UHC. Really, my brief recap can be summed up in 4 words: Two Germans, One Hole. Meanwhile, Avidya ate a spider eye, all while the worst start overall to a season in UHC continued. Last episode was great, and I‚Äôm sure that everyone is excited for S12E3 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**Mongooses** (Up 2)  *Why?*: I am **very** hesitant to put these guys above my number 2 pick (which I‚Äôll be talking about in a just a second), but the fact that these 2 are the only ones with a golden apple, and are the only ones with more than 13 hearts combined (17, 19 counting the uneaten apple) just makes it the safest pick to make. They also have a fine amount of diamonds, and are very close to getting an enchanting table. Granted, the last time I made a pick (last ranking) based off of PvE, they almost fell completely from first to worst. Having my fingers crossed that The Kurtain and The Badger maintain their first place position for longer than one episode.  *How Can They Improve?*: As they‚Äôre the only team that doesn‚Äôt require gold, they can actually set their sights and priorities on getting enchantments. Both of them have shown to be good PvEers, but they must find diamonds (something else that other teams, save for Red Shirts, haven‚Äôt done) and get enchanting before they can truly distinguish themselves as a favorite.  *Season Outlook*: I‚Äôm not even going to try to say. As it stands right now, it‚Äôs looking good‚Äîbut as we just saw‚Ä¶ That can all change in an instant.  2	**Brewski** (No Movement)  *Why?*: As I stated above, I am once again hesitant to not put these guys in first place. Without players like Etho, Nebris, or even MC, Pause is miles away the best PvPer in this season. While I‚Äôm still not putting Pyro in that same elite category, he is respectably good in his own right. More importantly, while Pause is near death, Pyro maintains full health. If Pyro can successfully cave and help Pause recover health (which he is fully capable of doing), this team will be a force to be reckoned with. Their previous experiences working together benefit them.   *How Can They Improve?*: If they can get Pause to higher health, they would move up to the top spot off of Pause‚Äô superior PvP ability.  *Season Outlook*: Pause‚Äô archery skills are the only thing I can trust in at this point. Of course, I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in his ability to not screw around and die, leaving Pyro on his own.  3	**Red Shirt** (Up 2)  *Why?*: Compared to the majority of the playing field, these 2 are actually doing alright in health. Considering that, along with how they‚Äôve managed to find diamonds and this team is doing relatively well.   *How Can They Improve?*: Like practically every team (with the exception of possibly Mongooses), they need gold. However, with having more health than others (as well as actually having diamonds), they can afford to make it a priority to get enchantments and earn a huge edge in battle.   *Season Outlook*: As I‚Äôve said, better than 5 other teams, and if they get enchantments and gain some lost health, they could potentially win it all.  4	**NoBeef** (Up 2)  *Why?*: It‚Äôs not that they made a huge amount of progress, but they managed to get full armor without losing any further health, while everyone else was purely bleeding.  *How Can They Improve?*: They seem to be moving along a good pace, but they need to find gold if they want a marginal chance of winning it all.   *Season Outlook*:  They could end up waiting out the storm (the way other teams are playing in PvE), and finishing decently, but they still have low health.  5	**Germinators** (Down 1)  *Why?*: As hilarious as the situation they were in was, the hilarity doesn‚Äôt necessarily make up for the health that was pointless lost as a result. The ‚Äútwo Germans in one hole‚Äù contributed to JL‚Äôs ‚Äúcrippled‚Äù status by the end of the episode. I‚Äôm almost tempted to put them below Zisteau in that they have absolutely no armor and the same cumulative health. They seem to have lost track of their whole ‚Äúcalm &amp; intelligent‚Äù way of playing.   *How Can They Improve?*: As I‚Äôve said countless times by now for almost every team, they need gold. And a lot of it.  *Season Outlook*: They‚Äôre out of the 1x1, but can they get out of the hole? That seems rather doubtful.  6	**Lavatrap** (Up 1)  *Why?*: By himself (aside from the voice of Pakratt, which I kind of disagree with allowing), Zisteau is in bad shape, but isn‚Äôt quite as crippled as those below him.   *How Can They Improve?*: He has to find gold, and avoid killing himself with lava at all costs. Potentially a trip to the Nether would be in order should he find melon seeds in the mineshaft he‚Äôs currently in.  *Season Outlook*: Not absolutely horrible, but by no means good.  7	**WolfPack** (Down 6)  *Why?*: Well then, how stupid do I look right now. I am spared from absolute embarrassment, mostly thanks to Avidya eating that spider eye (which I‚Äôll be discussing next), but regardless, my initial first place team now drops to second to last. They fall after being absolutely destroyed by 1.6 zombies (who are quickly proving to be just as deadly as skeletons), losing a total of 18.5 hearts within one episode. Anderz falls (though a miracle comeback may have been possible with him alive), and Guude is crippled.   *How Can They Improve?*: Obviously, Guude must recover. It‚Äôs not impossible, we‚Äôve seen more dubious comebacks resulting in a high finish before, but he‚Äôs going to need Anderz level gold, without Anderz.  *Season Outlook*: I had high hopes for them after the first episode. Those hopes are now significantly lower.  8	**White Rush‚Äôn** (No Movement)  *Why?*: By himself, and near death, I put Avidya under Guude based off the fact that I feel Guude is a better individual player and Avidya still lacks much in terms of armor. Regardless, both of them are in a terrible position.   *How Can They Improve?*: He will likely need a miracle to pull this off (granted, the last time I said that, BDubs had his legendary jackpot find).  *Season Outlook*: He needs either a miracle, or he must go out with a bang (as he did in S10, greatly affecting the outcome).   *Writer‚Äôs Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate. Power Rankings are based off the previous episode and are released right before the current episode is released.

For example, I still sometimes find myself throwing dirty clothes all over the floor. It's just that now, the only clothes I have are ones I wear regularly. When I do laundry, I am picking them all up off the floor to wash, instead of leaving some for the next load (which could be a week later).   Same with doing dishes. When I had a lot of dishes and silverware, I could easily get a sink and counter full, before I had to wash something. Now, even if everything I have is dirty, it's still only about a sink full.   But a big part of it for me is not having so much junk, helps me *want* to keep things clean. Even when my house starts to get messy, it;s not as overwhelming as it was when I had so much junk.

t5_2ubfr,scarlettenoir,1374214095,"I just had my surgery on Monday, and for me recovery has been super quick. The first day I stayed in bed, but that's because it takes me a while to get over general anesthesia. Day two was the worst pain-wise, but the only pain worth mentioning was from the lipo my surgeon did around my ribs and arm pits (this is standard for his reductions).  I needed help showering on day 1 &amp; 2 but have been pretty independent since day 3. I lost no sensitivity, and in fact gained some back in my nipples that I had lost after exclusively pumping for two babies in two years.   I was worried about scarring, so I bought Newgel‚Ñ¢ and will be applying it at my post op visit when the silicone tape comes off with my sutures.  So far I really like the size and shape of my breasts. I was a 38 HH and lost 50 lbs, ending up a 34HH just before my surgery. Now, with my current state of swelling, I appear to be somewhere between an E-F. I won't know for sure for about 10-12 more weeks though. In the meantime I'm rocking this size L genie bra.   I have already noticed an almost complete reprieve to the constant upper back and neck pain I suffered from, and that I no longer feel pin pricks between my shoulder blades, so yay :)  **edit** I forgot to mention a few of the best parts! I've been systematically trying on every blouse and dress in my closet and being amazed by how much more flattering the fit is, and how much room there is for my boobs to breathe now. Also, they are so beautifully perky that I will, for the first time in my life, be able to wear strapless bras --&gt; strapless clothes! A whole new section of wardrobe just became available to me.

Daterra‚Äôs unique Penta¬Æ sorting and packaging system sorts out defects and under- or overripe coffee over several steps.  The Sweet Collection is a pulped-natural coffee. The cherry-pulp is removed in a machine, pulpier, and the parchment beans covered by the mucilage are then dried. This develops more body and sweetness than washed coffee with the advantage of having an extra sorting method in the pulpier. The green coffee from Daterra is not packed in traditional jute sacks but in vacuumed and nitrogen-flushed aluminium foil bags which prolongs the life of the green coffee significantly.)",¬Æ

I basically can't feel much then I fall to my bed. During that time, I was asking myself. Am I gonna die soon? I continue having difficulty breathing and everything seems to be going dark and I just feel like giving up my breath and just lay there because its suffering. Until a thought came Into my mind. For some reason, I started praying to god, to allow me to keep on living for one reason. So that i can save the world and to change the world. I prayed to live a second time so that I influence people and change their life. Sounds funny but its basically a true story :) Pretty amazing experience coz it just helped me identify my purpose of living in this world. I realize that my desire of changing the world is so strong that it actually keep me alive.

These threads have asynchronous sockets either waiting for an event a mouse movement or keypress or passing a new screenshot to the client. Similarly the client has a bunch of asynchronous socks open running in different threads. When it detects a keystroke or mouse movement it sends it to the server.

t5_2xbh8,UnctiousSC,1374263906,"I'm not sure what I'm meant to be acknowledging. That doesn't sound like criticism. It sounds like an accusation from a person trying to stir things up. I can say I'm definitely not trying to play a weak town, but I'm also not completely convinced that I play a weak town. Sample size isn't large enough yet.   That being said, the scenario is interesting to discuss. Can you ever ensure that the people you're playing with are playing in the interest of the town? No, you can't. Luckily, in our case, the game has a sense of longevity. There's a sample set (i.e., previous games) that we can work with when we consider the roles of the other players in the game. We have the ability to see behavior patterns and how they change over time.  The key to reading people is often in the details of their behavior. The things that are the most telling are often the things they're unaware of. Everyone has tells. If someone were to constantly play a 'weak town' in order to better conceal their mafia gameplay, I'm almost certain there would be other things that could be read that would reveal the truth. In the event that nothing could be picked up on, I'd still rather lynch a quiet person than someone who's just a shitty town. There's a hierarchy of lynchable people in my mind, and I think the most lynchable, aside from a mafia slip-up, are quiet people.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'healthy' or 'damaging' to the meta. What's better for meta: gameplay that reinforces doing things as they've always been done, or gameplay that forces the meta to evolve? I'd argue that forcing the meta to evolve is generally the healthiest thing for a game. Letting meta shift is what keeps the game intriguing, and is what would keep me coming back to the game week after week.  The question that follows is: What allows meta to evolve?  The answer is depth of gameplay.  Does an intentionally weak town enhance depth or detract from it?  I think that's a harder question to answer. I think it definitely makes for a frustrating experience, but I'm not sure that it really throws a wrench into the lynch hierarchy that I was talking about earlier. If someone is playing poorly, does it matter if their intention is to play poorly? If we're thinking purely logically, without reads, I don't think it does. If they're playing bad town, they're still just a bad town, and they sit on the same rung as any other bad town. If we're playing with reads, then to some extent you have to trust your instincts. What about that person HAS changed? Are they really only playing bad town, or is this bad town different from their bad town when they're mafia?  I would say I don't think this style is Betta for Meta‚Ñ¢, but I also don't think it's very bad for it either.",‚Ñ¢
t5_2snuc,Xavier_Harkonnen,1374264130,"&gt;I didn't realize humanism was some sort of movement.  Did you look at it's origins, it might [surprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism#Predecessors) you.  &gt;But what I was trying to say is that humans left to their own devices will do nothing but destroy themselves, which really is all of our history up to this day.  That is not what humanism is. Conflicting ideologies, that claim Absolute Truth‚Ñ¢, are what have us destroy each other. Not *human nature*. (If it doesn't claim to be the One Truth, or that it can't be wrong, then there is room for dialog to occur.)  &gt;God has given us a chance,  I am not sure how in the same breath, say that it's in human nature to destroy ourselves, and say that God has some sort of play in it. Would you mind elaborating on that?  &gt;Human logic and reason really won't help you out very much.  Are you are asserting that the very computer (or phone) you are typing this on was of divine providence? This is patently false. Unless you mean this in another way, please expand on it. (Otherwise it reads really weird, when you say it like that with no context.)  &gt;It will take a cold hard look at yourself one day  Ex-Christian. It was because I did take a '*cold hard look*' at myself that was one of leading reasons for my de-conversion. (That and reading the Bible for myself for the first time without have anyone dictate it to me.)  &gt;I hope you can experience it.  Where was this revelation when I supposedly needed it? (Don't answer that.) This sort of thing is not suited for a debate forum. It does nothing, in this context, to continue the debate. It comes off as if you are proselytizing. Which can put people off right away. It would be like me saying; ""Your illogical, and you need to open *your* mind, and take a hard look at *yourself*.""

t5_2to85,Draconics,1374271496,"*NOTE: I successfully completed this in time to post on the prediction thread yesterday, but here it are my power rankings for this season once more for those that didn't see it (as I posted it a little late).*  **HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, we laughed as some of the players committed some of the most hilarious mistakes in the history of UHC. Really, my brief recap can be summed up in 4 words: Two Germans, One Hole. Meanwhile, Avidya ate a spider eye, all while the worst start overall to a season in UHC continued. Last episode was great, and I‚Äôm sure that everyone is excited for S12E3 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**Mongooses** (Up 2)  *Why?*: I am **very** hesitant to put these guys above my number 2 pick (which I‚Äôll be talking about in a just a second), but the fact that these 2 are the only ones with a golden apple, and are the only ones with more than 13 hearts combined (17, 19 counting the uneaten apple) just makes it the safest pick to make. They also have a fine amount of diamonds, and are very close to getting an enchanting table. Granted, the last time I made a pick (last ranking) based off of PvE, they almost fell completely from first to worst. Having my fingers crossed that The Kurtain and The Badger maintain their first place position for longer than one episode.  *How Can They Improve?*: As they‚Äôre the only team that doesn‚Äôt require gold, they can actually set their sights and priorities on getting enchantments. Both of them have shown to be good PvEers, but they must find diamonds (something else that other teams, save for Red Shirts, haven‚Äôt done) and get enchanting before they can truly distinguish themselves as a favorite.  *Season Outlook*: I‚Äôm not even going to try to say. As it stands right now, it‚Äôs looking good‚Äîbut as we just saw‚Ä¶ That can all change in an instant.  2	**Brewski** (No Movement)  *Why?*: As I stated above, I am once again hesitant to not put these guys in first place. Without players like Etho, Nebris, or even MC, Pause is miles away the best PvPer in this season. While I‚Äôm still not putting Pyro in that same elite category, he is respectably good in his own right. More importantly, while Pause is near death, Pyro maintains full health. If Pyro can successfully cave and help Pause recover health (which he is fully capable of doing), this team will be a force to be reckoned with. Their previous experiences working together benefit them.   *How Can They Improve?*: If they can get Pause to higher health, they would move up to the top spot off of Pause‚Äô superior PvP ability.  *Season Outlook*: Pause‚Äô archery skills are the only thing I can trust in at this point. Of course, I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in his ability to not screw around and die, leaving Pyro on his own.  3	**Red Shirt** (Up 2)  *Why?*: Compared to the majority of the playing field, these 2 are actually doing alright in health. Considering that, along with how they‚Äôve managed to find diamonds and this team is doing relatively well.   *How Can They Improve?*: Like practically every team (with the exception of possibly Mongooses), they need gold. However, with having more health than others (as well as actually having diamonds), they can afford to make it a priority to get enchantments and earn a huge edge in battle.   *Season Outlook*: As I‚Äôve said, better than 5 other teams, and if they get enchantments and gain some lost health, they could potentially win it all.  4	**NoBeef** (Up 2)  *Why?*: It‚Äôs not that they made a huge amount of progress, but they managed to get full armor without losing any further health, while everyone else was purely bleeding.  *How Can They Improve?*: They seem to be moving along a good pace, but they need to find gold if they want a marginal chance of winning it all.   *Season Outlook*:  They could end up waiting out the storm (the way other teams are playing in PvE), and finishing decently, but they still have low health.  5	**Germinators** (Down 1)  *Why?*: As hilarious as the situation they were in was, the hilarity doesn‚Äôt necessarily make up for the health that was pointless lost as a result. The ‚Äútwo Germans in one hole‚Äù contributed to JL‚Äôs ‚Äúcrippled‚Äù status by the end of the episode. I‚Äôm almost tempted to put them below Zisteau in that they have absolutely no armor and the same cumulative health. They seem to have lost track of their whole ‚Äúcalm &amp; intelligent‚Äù way of playing.   *How Can They Improve?*: As I‚Äôve said countless times by now for almost every team, they need gold. And a lot of it.  *Season Outlook*: They‚Äôre out of the 1x1, but can they get out of the hole? That seems rather doubtful.  6	**Lavatrap** (Up 1)  *Why?*: By himself (aside from the voice of Pakratt, which I kind of disagree with allowing), Zisteau is in bad shape, but isn‚Äôt quite as crippled as those below him.   *How Can They Improve?*: He has to find gold, and avoid killing himself with lava at all costs. Potentially a trip to the Nether would be in order should he find melon seeds in the mineshaft he‚Äôs currently in.  *Season Outlook*: Not absolutely horrible, but by no means good.  7	**WolfPack** (Down 6)  *Why?*: Well then, how stupid do I look right now. I am spared from absolute embarrassment, mostly thanks to Avidya eating that spider eye (which I‚Äôll be discussing next), but regardless, my initial first place team now drops to second to last. They fall after being absolutely destroyed by 1.6 zombies (who are quickly proving to be just as deadly as skeletons), losing a total of 18.5 hearts within one episode. Anderz falls (though a miracle comeback may have been possible with him alive), and Guude is crippled.   *How Can They Improve?*: Obviously, Guude must recover. It‚Äôs not impossible, we‚Äôve seen more dubious comebacks resulting in a high finish before, but he‚Äôs going to need Anderz level gold, without Anderz.  *Season Outlook*: I had high hopes for them after the first episode. Those hopes are now significantly lower.  8	**White Rush‚Äôn** (No Movement)  *Why?*: By himself, and near death, I put Avidya under Guude based off the fact that I feel Guude is a better individual player and Avidya still lacks much in terms of armor. Regardless, both of them are in a terrible position.   *How Can They Improve?*: He will likely need a miracle to pull this off (granted, the last time I said that, BDubs had his legendary jackpot find).  *Season Outlook*: He needs either a miracle, or he must go out with a bang (as he did in S10, greatly affecting the outcome).   *Writer‚Äôs Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

t5_2rnve,GideonWainright,1374277484,"Well, this went for about $350 yesterday:   Processor: Intel Core i5-3330 Processor (4 cores / 4 threads, 3.00 GHz,6MB Cache) Operating system: Windows 8 Standard 64 - English Display: None - Desktop Graphics: Intel¬Æ Graphics Media Accelerator HD Memory: 8GB (2 X 4GB) PC3-12800 DDR3 1600MHz SDRAM UDIMM Memory Hard Drive: 1TB, 7200RPM Serial ATA 2.5"" Hard Drive Optical Drive: DVD Recordable Serial ATA  You're getting a better CPU, about the same amount if not quality ram, and the same size HDD.  Assuming the PSU upgrade, you're saving about $75 because of the Microsoft tax, which is left out of the builds I am looking at here and elsewhere on the thread.  You're also getting an optical drive which can be handy.    You do sacrifice overclocking, however, with the i5.  But let's be honest, what are the odds that a budget build gaming PC is going to be overclocked with the added cooling expenses?    Also, this will be heresy here but the time savings by not having to build everything, especially for first-timers, may have some value.  Of course, there is also a lot of educational value in doing a complete build as well.  So I guess if you have a free copy of Windows somehow or don't plan on serious gaming and plan on Linux, it's about the same price.  Otherwise you're saving money but sacrificing quality of parts.    Personally, I could live with the lesser parts and put that $75 into a better GPU.  Odds are your gaming experience will be impacted by the 7770 card you suggested before it will be impacted by the quality of the other parts.  As priced above, that extra money could score a 7870 or 660, which would have a bigger impact on gaming then the fact you're using Lenovo's ""low quality/mediocre parts""  ",¬Æ

Thanks once again to all the donators.  To the guys that are skeptical, hopefully this has (to an extent) proven the legitimacy of this donation/raffle.

t5_2qh03,mazzratazz,1374282661,"Legacy of Kain is probably my favourite video game series, but I really can't get on board with the ""sequel plz"" chorus. It would be shit. Obviously I can't see into any potential future, so I'll just go by the following:  - Most of the key players behind the Legacy of Kain series have since left developer Crystal Dynamics. This is a particular problem for writer/director/co-creator Amy Hennig (now directing Uncharted, unsettlingly), who was responsible for the brunt of the story. Considering the story (and presentation of it) is one of the main strong points of LoK, this is a Very Bad Thing‚Ñ¢. One of the primary reasons Blood Omen 2 is generally considered (and rightfully so) the weakest game in the series is because it had a different team behind it, including a different writer and director.   - Crystal Dynamics has some great gameplay designers and developers left, as evidenced by their revival(s) of Tomb Raider. However, with the most recent game they essentially went the way of Uncharted - a linear QTE-heavy game which actually wants to be a movie. Defiance and Soul Reaver 2 were pretty linear games, but not nearly to the level of an Uncharted. That's not to say a LoK sequel would necessarily be LoK: Uncharted, but (and this brings me to my next point)  - Mainstream gaming as it stands right now, in my view, wouldn't be receptive of a LoK game crafted in the way they used to make 'em. The story was too cerebral, the gameplay too puzzle-heavy for a developer which has recently been pushing for less interactivity, not more. And in a climate filled with Call of Duties and Uncharteds, I just can't see a LoK game (an actually good one, true to the ones we love) be approved by a publisher, let alone thrive. See also: the recent rumours of Nosgoth, the possible new game in the series, which is said to be a multiplayer Dota-style game. Spirit of LoK, much?  - As others have said, the story might have had loose ends but it ended quite nicely with a lot of threads wrapped up. Do we really NEED another game? Where does this endless clamouring for sequels come from? Why can't people just be satisfied with what they've got? (which in the case of LoK is plenty, really)  I'd really love for people to consider these points, or at least offer my pessimist self some rebuttals, before blindly asking for a sequel.  TL;DR: all signs point to a potential sequel sucking, so please think twice before rabidly asking.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r4w1,aim2free,1374289490,"&gt; Well, the rest of the world believes in the concept of money  so what... people believe in many things, but this doesn't make them true.  &gt; it's a generally accepted form of correcting for market failures in market based economies.  :-))  ""market based economy"".... that was a cool joke. In theory it is claimed by some that we have a ""market based economy"" but it is completely disabled due to a lot of anti-capitalistic instruments.  &gt; I think your belief in the ""conspiracy"" of money is reflective of your feelings of personal impotence in a largely random, chaotic, and impersonal world.  :-D   That was a great joke‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£  PS. I think you are a troll ;-) but a fun one with some self respect.  Why this was a great joke, you said:  &gt; largely random, chaotic, and impersonal world.  What is completely wrong with the world is that it is completely non-random, completely predictable, and not at all chaotic (even though in principle the system is chaotic, but we are speaking about [_attractor basins_](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Basin_of_attraction) which appear as basically a status quo system). However, the non-random is wrong in that way that it is completely upside down, (almost) everything is made the wrong way.  Regarding _impersonal_ I can not really say that either. I would merely say that it has _too much personality_ (like a stubborn ass).  --------   In case you are not a troll, only stupid as you used a word like ""market economy"" and may actually believe this, that is you live in a kind of surrealistic dream world.   In theory we could have a ""market economy"" based upon maximizing monetary profit, according well known competetive market principles, but as I said, our current ""capitalist"" system contains too many anti-capitalistic instruments to make this work. I give a few examples:   * Buy your competitor ‚ù¢ (most big companies)     * Form cartels ‚ù¢ (most big companies)     * Patent your stuff ‚ù¢ (e.g. Monsanto/Microsoft/Apple/younameit)     * Make what you sell a secret ‚ù¢ (e.g. Microsoft...)      * Sell your secret stuff over and over and over ‚ù¢ (e.g. Microsoft)     * Use bundling and slave contracts to lock in customers ‚ù¢ (e.g. Microsoft)      A good example of this is e.g. **ordinary laptops**. Despite **GNU/Linux (based upon a copy-left echo system) is the market leader** within **personal computing, super computing and data centers**, it is still **almost impossible to buy a cheap laptop without Windows**, as Microsoft has ""succeeded"" extremely well with the bounding/bundling principle‚ù¢ Laptops without Windows would quickly make competition work, but due to the huge ballast of the Windows system (and its other costly adverse side effects upon the society through e.g. governmental tax payment and hard to decode protocols) a laptop can simply not become ""cheap"" as you also _(in most countries)_ have to pay a high fee for something, irrespectively if you are using this system or not.   I have for my own **used Linux on all my computers** _(laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, smartphones)_  **since 1996** , but despite this **I have a huge pile of unused Windows systems**, as in most cases I have **not been able to get rid of this taxation**, thus indirectly, with my purchase, I am supporting a company whose products I do not want and do not believe in.Ôªø That is, the system is sick‚ù¢  Where the fuck is the ""market economy""????  but I assume you were just a joking troll.",‚ù£

t5_2qt0d,ExiledBahraini,1374309897,"&gt;Now there is an emphasis on the Sunni-Shia divide because an opportunity was seen to amplify this tension and distrust between the two parties. And you know what? People from both sides have willingly drank the kool-aid. It's so common in this day and age to hear slander being spoken about Shias inside Sunni households. I am also 100% sure that the same is true within Shia households with regards to Sunnis (I probed my Shia friends lol.) And now people see what's happening in Syria as some sort of Sunni-Shia war, instead of the myriad of other things it could be.  You sortta hit the nail on the head here. I say ""sortta"" because its not *completely* true. I loved my Sunni friends, I never even thought about it until I came to Bahrain where it was emphasized so much, to the point that when I came back to Bahrain, people use to batter me if I was Shi'ite to Sunni, and if I had a Blue Passport or a Red One *(American Passport or Bahraini Passport)*. I'm sure /u/Beefjerking will come down my throat for this, as usual. But I never cared about it, let alone knew that I was Shi'ite till I was enrolled in Private school in Bahrain. A large majority of Sunnis don't care about it either, its mostly the members of the Royal Family and hardcore/ignorant loyalists which did.   Problem is, after the revolution I lost a lot of Sunni friends who saw me, and even portrayed me as a 'Traitor' and 'Iranian Stooge.' I can understand the propaganda, but a best friend of 4 years just turned around and called me a traitor for what? For being Shi'ite or for siding with Democracy? Or was it the latter of the two? I still can't figure it out, but it hurt. And a lot of Shi'ites felt that way, unfortunately. Of course, many Sunnis stayed quiet, but that hurt more than those who were insulting me and threatening my life.  And the biggest issue wasn't that they were calling me a traitor, its because they were insulting my religion more than my position - as if they had this built up hatred of Shi'ite implanted into them long before I had a position against the government *(Just to be clear, I always hated the government and was never really quiet about it)*. I'm sadden to say that I lost trust in most Sunnis for this simple reason, not because they're the ones that hated me, but because a majority of them stayed quiet while they were torturing/jailing others simply for their religious sect. more than anything else.   Now, /u/Beefjerking may tell a different story, and say that mine doesn't accurately represent what *actually* happened, but this is my story.  This is what I experienced, and I know I'm not alone. Nonetheless, I love the guy. He's helped alot, and he's smarter than he looks.

t5_2qt0d,poorfag,1374333765,"&gt;What is it with you, can Israel do no wrong in your eyes?   It can, and it does, Israel by necessity and since its very inception has put its own security above anything else, sometimes including human rights. Which is great since it is why I'm not in a grave somewhere, but which is also not that great since innocent people get harmed for that to happen. America also does a lot of bad shit, so much in fact that it could with all honesty be called evil, or at least ""blind with greed and in total disregard for human life"" since, unlike Israel, fights its wars for money and influence, not survival (or protection, lately). I'd still live in Israel or America over Egypt, Syria or Nicaragua though, and so would the vast vast majority of the Arab world, which is my point.   &gt;You make it seem like Arabs are just 'butthurt' over nothing and we should bow down to your amazing first-world‚Ñ¢ country status.  Arabs are so many and so diverse that there is no way to generalize them all. But yes, if you are a Palestinian who lost his land you are correct in being butthurt (although refusing to move on with your life regardless of what happens is a bit too much) but your average lowly-educated Arab (or even Muslim) who has never actually seen an Israeli nor had any kind of oppression by Israelis and yet dreams of of exploding himself on a Zionist bus is very much butthurt at the fact that Israel triumphs where their own countries failed, yes. There's absolutely no reason for an Indonesian or a Somalian to feel any kind of bad feelings towards Israel, but that doesn't stop them from having them (nor their leaders from taking advantage of that).   &gt;How about the settlements eh? Most Israelis I've met concede that as illegal and immoral at least.  They are illegal and immoral, no doubt, and even I would support a building freeze. But they are great for security, Ariel Sharon realised that turning the West Bank into a swiss cheese would all but kill any kind of serious armed insurgency, or put in other words, there is absolutely no way for the Palestinians to revolt successfully with the settlements in their place. Which kills our international respect, makes the Palestinians angry and puts our forces in a very delicate position, but also what keeps us safe. Fucking bastard loved Israel above and beyond our wildest dreams, and had the kind of mind you really wouldn't want in your enemy's power. That is why I would absolutely refuse any sort of settlement withdrawal, even without using the ""look at Gaza"" argument.   &gt; Forget any other grievances against Israel; aren't the settlements enough reason for Arabs to be 'butthurt'?   No they aren't. Palestinians sure, but not ""Arabs"". There's a huge difference between being angry and butthurt, and they are not interchangeable; and Arabs living far away but foaming at the mouth at the thought of attacking Israel are butthurt, not angry. Or another example from the other side, Israelis are always angry at Arabs, but we are immensely butthurt at the Orthodox Jewish population, which is why a TV star with zero political background can become Israel's #2 politician just behind Netanyahu himself, in less than 6 months, just by talking about the Orthodox, without even mentioning Palestine at all.   There's no logical reason at all for the butthurt that Israel causes amongst the Arab/Muslim world, which is where my theory that the butthurt stems from Israel's high standards of living comes from. Not proof of any kind, but I've talked with a lot of Arabs in omegle passing off as an interested American and they all have confirmed my theory, from an Egyptian jealous about Israel's liberality when it comes to sex to a Lebanese jealous at the Technion, with many others in between. If you have a better theory as to why Arabs and Muslims all over the world (even the ones living in modern Western countries for decades, looking at this subreddit you can see so many people people so proud of their Arab roots learning and living in the West) are so devastated at Israel's existence please do tell.   And just as a note to myself, I have to stop breaking my promise not to start arguments about Israel. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2tk0i,eudaimondaimon,1374344253,"The problem is that lay people don't understand the law *at all."" They haven't seen the mountains of prior work and history that has gone into constantly refining them trying to strike a balance between different interests.   You tell me it's a bad law - which parts do you think are bad? Do you even know what the law says? Have you actually read the statute? And can you tell me how the statute works in concert with all the other statutes, and generally how a Model Penal Code statutory framework functions (upon which Florida's laws are based)? I'm guessing that the responses to most of these questions would be in the negative - and that's completely fine. Not everyone's an expert on everything. But if you don't know any of those things then you really don't know how to evaluate whether it's a ""bad law"" or not.   So the common reaction for someone without this knowledge is to see one result, not like that result - and therefore conclude the law is bad. But all those results that were prevented from ever happening because the law is the way it is are invisible to you - but they're readily apparent to people who really do *know law.*  I will break it down for you here, so you can really tell me which parts you think are bad: The relevant sections are Florida Statutes ¬ß766.012 and ¬ß766.032.  * 776.012 Use of force in defense of person.‚ÄîA person is justified in using force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other‚Äôs imminent use of unlawful force. **However, a person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat if:**  * (1) He or she **reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm** to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony; or  * (2) Under those circumstances permitted pursuant to s. 776.013.  776.013 is just about areas where there would be an automatic presumption of reasonable belief that force is necessary (someone breaking into your home, car-jacking, etc.  So the part of that which is ""stand your ground""? - the one where it says ""no duty to retreat."" So is this part unique to wacky-old-Florida? No. These states also have no duty to retreat: **Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia.**  And now ¬ß766.032, which may be unique to Florida (statutorially at least, in practice it's the same EVERYWHERE else).  * 776.032 Immunity from criminal prosecution and civil action for justifiable use of force.‚Äî   * (1) **A person who uses force as permitted in s. 776.012, s. 776.013, or s. 776.031 is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force**, unless the person against whom force was used is a law enforcement officer, as defined in s. 943.10(14), who was acting in the performance of his or her official duties and the officer identified himself or herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person using force knew or reasonably should have known that the person was a law enforcement officer. As used in this subsection, the term ""criminal prosecution"" includes arresting, detaining in custody, and charging or prosecuting the defendant.   * (2) A law enforcement agency may use standard procedures for investigating the use of force as described in subsection (1), **but the agency may not arrest the person for using force unless it determines that there is probable cause that the force that was used was unlawful.**   * (3) The court shall award reasonable attorney√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fees, court costs, compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred by the defendant in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as provided in subsection (1).  The first bolded part just takes away civil liability for *legitimate* self-defense claims only.  The second bolded part is just a way of resolving a contradiction in the law by applying the usual presumption of innocence to actions that are not criminal due to a **justification**- and I bolded that because justifications have legal relevance. If a normally-criminal act (shooting and killing a man) has a legally valid justification (self-defense), than that means **no crime has been committed.** A justified crime *is not a crime at all.*  Now, the police can only arrest you if they have probable cause that a crime has been committed - and I think that's pretty sensible. For example - I'm sure you'd agree that it would be completely unjust for the police to arrest you for rape if they've no probable cause that the crime even happened - right?  Well the same is true for self-defense. If the use of force is justified by the law, *no crime has been committed.* It would be an inversion of the criminal justice system to arrest everyone who uses force (deadly or not) in self-defense and then make the prove that it WAS self defense - that throws ""innocent until proven guilty"" right out the window.  Normally, with straight up murder - the police need probable cause (a) someone is dead, and (b) that you were the one that killed them. But with cases of attested self-defense, neither of these are in dispute. These same elements are insufficient for creating probable cause. This part of stand your ground merely codifies what every police department and district attorney all over the country already do - they don't bring every self-defense case to trial. They only bring the ones where they have *probable cause* that the self-defense claim is invalid. That's what stand-your-ground says - that you can't be arrested and taken to trial for murder **UNLESS** the state has a good reason to disbelieve your self-defense claim.",‚Ñ¢

Let's go ahead and fall asleep in the middle of the day while doing work and miss the prediction posting time"" edition. Basically, I'm late again on account of my lack of sleep.*  **HYPEHYPEHYPE.** In last episode of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore, Zisteau found his second high level enchanting book, teams began progressing towards better equipment as they began to get closer to enchantments. The Iron Bajtain fell, leaving the‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFirewall‚Äù (?) as the last full health competitor. Last episode was great, and I‚Äôm sure that everyone is excited for S12E4 of Ultra Hardcore, but before you get your snacks and watch what is sure to be a fantastic episode of UHC, here are your semi-daily Ultra Hardcore power rankings.   **Power Rankings**  1	**Red Shirt** (Up 2)  *Why?*: With a fair amount of health, enchantments, and enough arrows to make it count, Red Shirt goes higher than their rival Mongooses off the merit of their superior health and tactical ability of Seth. While the majority of other teams have been greatly struggling with the PvE aspect of the game, Red Shirt has managed to become the first to obtain enchantments.   *How Can They Improve?*: Seth knows how to get tier 2 enchantments, which would truly make these guys a force in PvP. Tier 1 enchants already give these guys a huge edge, enough to cancel out the skill of someone like Pause. More gold would obviously be preferable.  *Season Outlook*: Hopefully the number one doesn‚Äôt fall again.   2	**Mongooses** (Down 1)  *Why?*: While the Bajtain did fall, they managed to recover some health (and with another one just being made). Most importantly, the Mongooses did obtain the necessary items for enchantments. The loss of health was enough to warrant them falling out of the number one spot, but they‚Äôre still a strong team with enchantments. I am a little hesitant to put these guys above my number 3 spot, but I‚Äôm also hesitant not to put a team about to get enchantments quite high.   *How Can They Improve?*: They must start getting their enchantments going, and then they have to get more arrows and gold.  *Season Outlook*: Provided they can play the PvE aspect well and not many others get enchantments, they are looking like a very good team.  3	**Brewski** (Down 1)  *Why?*: I honestly do believe that I am most likely going to regret this decision to put Brewski at 3. They do lead in health, but they still seem very under equipped. The fact that they just managed to get food is a testament to how slow they‚Äôre moving in terms of equipping themselves. They only have basic equipment, and Pause doesn‚Äôt have the bow (or the arrows) that would truly make him a force to be reckoned with. While they‚Äôve been handling the PvE aspect quite well (Pause is fine in terms of health, relatively, and Pyro has iron-manned), they‚Äôre quickly being outclassed in terms of equipment. Regardless, I feel like I‚Äôd embarrass myself if I put Brewski lower (or said that they don‚Äôt have a chance without enchantments), as Pause could potentially do what he does best and screw with my rankings (read: Season 5 finale, Season 10 finale).   *How Can They Improve?*: While Pause is an elite PvPer (and Pyro is no joke either), they must find diamonds in order to have a legitimately viable chance of winning. Of course, getting another apple for Pause, a bow, and some arrows would be dangerous without diamonds.   *Season Outlook*: I don‚Äôt doubt Pause‚Äô PvP ability (I learned not to the hard way), but they‚Äôre at least going to need a bow with arrows to be a viable contender.  4	**Lava ~~Trap~~** (Up 2)  *Why?*: While he still doesn‚Äôt have enchantments, he is on the verge of tying Kurt for most deadly UHC weapon ever (assuming he puts Sharpness V for victory on an iron sword), and has managed to recover a fair amount of health. While I don‚Äôt consider Zisteau to be a very good PvPer, there isn‚Äôt much he can do wrong with an unbelievable sword and a fair amount of arrows. Interestingly enough, Zisteau has more health by himself than two of the teams, and he could very easily demolish a team (a la KurtJMac, Season 10) by himself with that sword once he has it made.  *How Can They Improve?*: Preferably, after he makes that sword, he should be able to get diamonds and enchant the rest of his gear. Of course, putting that enchantment on his sword is the most important priority. Another apple to get him to full health would be nice.  *Season Outlook*: For someone who‚Äôs been by himself the longest, good.  5	**Germinators** (No Movement)  *Why?*: They have nothing in terms of equipment beyond not even full armor and swords. With no bow (or arrows) and minimal health, these two don‚Äôt have much of a chance in PvP, or PvE for that matter.  *How Can They Improve?*: Obviously, gold is the priority. With no advanced equipment whatsoever, they have to prioritize health.   *Season Outlook*: They need German efficiency to step into full gear.  6	**NoBeef** (Down 2)  *Why?*: Lost health and a relatively unproductive episode (aside from more arrows) drops NoBeef to extremely low health, and extremely bad chances. Beef has been successful in seasons before, following a terrible start. However, as mobs chip away at their health, their chances fall even lower.   *How Can They Improve?*: I‚Äôll repeat what I said last time for these guys‚Äîthey need gold. Last episode was extremely unproductive honestly, with hiding for the night and a very goofy caving session. They don‚Äôt have the luxury of being able to prioritize enchantments.  *Season Outlook*: Minimal, but still, possible.   7	**White Rush‚Äôn** (Up 1)  *Why?*: Avidya is taking a fine approach to near-death survival without a partner. He is starting to collect more gold and potentially mount a miracle comeback. I agree with him when he says that he getting over the beginning ‚Äújitters‚Äù. If he continues to play carefully like this, he may have a chance.  *How Can They Improve?*: Anderz didn‚Äôt find any gold for the first time in his UHC career, so there is definitely more gold for Avidya to take to mount a miracle comeback. More zany and unbelievable things have happened in UHC.  *Season Outlook*: Very bleak. But I‚Äôve said that about a lot of people en route to a high finish.  8	**WolfPack** (Down 1)  *Why?*: With Guude‚Äôs death (which I believe only he posted in his third episode), WolfPack becomes the first team eliminated, and I have completely embarrassed myself, as my first place team has dropped to last within two episodes.  *How Can They Improve?*: Perhaps dogs will come over by their skeletons and be tamed by them from beyond the grave.  *Season Outlook*: it‚Äôs the end for these two. From first to worst in my book.  *Writer‚Äôs Note: All Power Rankings written by **Draconics** are all opinionated and open for debate.

Within minutes, my head start to get very hot and there just seems to have difficulties in my breathing. When I stood up, my vision blurred same goes to my hearing. I basically can't feel much then I fall to my bed. During that time, I was asking myself. Am I gonna die soon? I continue having difficulty breathing and everything seems to be going dark and I just feel like giving up my breath and just lay there because its suffering. Until a thought came Into my mind. For some reason, I started praying to god, to allow me to keep on living for one reason. So that i can save the world and to change the world.

t5_2qra3,KMelz,1374391628,"It‚Äôs actually largely a political and economic thing. Back in the Golden Age Of Perfect Orthodoxy In The Holy Byzantine Empire‚Ñ¢, having long hair and a long beard was a privilege reserved to the emperor. After the empire fell, the clergy were given political authority by the Turks, and so they grew their hair long and grew out their beards; this is also when the bishops started dressing like the emperor in the saccos and mitre and having the imperial anthem ‚ÄúEis polla eti despota‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äúlive forever, O despot‚Äù) sung for them.  Up until that point, parish clergy were generally clean shaven and had short hair, and bishops vested as priests with an omophor (compare icons of Hh. John Chrysostom or Basil the Great with those of John of San Francisco or Nikolai of South Canaan). Monks of course didn‚Äôt shave or get their hair cut, but this is part of giving up earthly concerns.  Of course, it‚Äôs been given a spiritualised interpretation, that we‚Äôre supposed to look like Jesus. Except Jesus didn‚Äôt have long hair or a long beard, it was too unhygienic - you need short hair to get out the parasitic bugs and the dirt that accumulate if you‚Äôre a dirt poor peasant in first century Roman Palestine. This spiritualising of something that originally had no real metaphor for the spiritual life is fairly common - the Royal Doors and Royal Hours were called that because that‚Äôs where the emperor would enter to take communion, and when the whole royal court would come to Hagia Sophia, respectively, not something to do with Jesus‚Äô kingship (at least not originally).  Personally I like having a bit of facial hair, but it‚Äôs become such a hallmark of being a True Devout Pious Orthodox Christian - you know, the guys calling themselves Barsanouphious Jones wearing prayer ropes as bracelets and carrying around *The Rudder*, and to whom the three most important dogmas are the Russian royal family, toll houses, and creationism - that I go for a more modest goatee and moustache combo.

t5_2qh0u,spycatz,1374419652,Thanks for reminding me! In 2011 I took my 80 year old father to Berlin to revisit where he served as an MP during the Korean War.

Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is actually responsible for crashing your system or that the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers belong to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help you investigate this further.

Maybe not the Checks and Balances‚Ñ¢ you learned about in grade school (between Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches), however --- FISA courts and the right to due process are checks on the power to delve into the actual data (not meta data).   &gt;Yeah, just like the other whistleblowers the Obama admin has persecuted.  I don't have a problem with people that break the law being prosecuted. As I said previously, there are [whistleblower protection laws](http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_advancedtags&amp;view=tag&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=102), and Snowden should have simply sought council before releasing what he had. If he thought that it was worth breaking the law, then he (and the rest of us) should accept responsibility for that. If the argument is: ""I'm willing to go to jail to reveal what I think is important information,"" then fine, but don't get all pissy when the other side holds up their end of the bargain.  &gt;Your comment in context says you would seek to obtain more then metadata. I ask why.  Whoops, too many threads. Right, so I'm totally fine with the actual data being recorded and held securely (not as part of the public record, obviously). I don't personally see it as a seizure, and I can think of ways of making it less like a seizure if need be (have the ISPs record the last N months of activity, and then go through regular warrant procedures to procure said data when such a warrant exists). The fundamental reason I'm OK with considering such things is that I believe we have a duty to provide a baseline of security so that we can maintain a peaceful democracy. I think that technology continues to advance and enable the ever present criminal element to be more efficient. If we want to keep up, we've got to allow technology to work for justice as well. Obviously, this is a balancing act --- and the most important thing is that we protect our ability to shift that balance from time to time. Was it wrong for Lincoln to suspend Habeas Corpus? I don't know, but since we were able to roll it back **shrug**, same for things like slavery, woman's suffrage, and prohibition. TLDR; it's not a seizure JUST to have records available for search later, and you'd still need a warrant to search said data. (meta data wasn't part of this discussion, and I state previously I don't think collection or search of meta data constitutes a violation of the 4th).  &gt; the majority of Americans don't like the idea of a government having the ability to listen in on their every call.

t5_2qi0a,wadcann,1374426621,"No, you do not.  This is asked something like weekly.  [My usual post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11v69k/using_a_guns_name_in_your_video_game/c6q00vq):  &gt; I'm not a lawyer, but: &gt;  &gt; [Using the Trademarks of Others](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others): &gt;  &gt; &gt;* Nominative Fair Use: The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(c)(3)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims. Some examples of nominative fair use include a newspaper's use of the ""New Kids on the Block"" trademark to create and report on polls asking readers questions about the musical group's popularity; another newspaper's use of the trademark ""Boston Marathon"" in order to report on the sporting event; and a photographer's use of ""Barbie"" dolls in parody photographs that criticized Mattel's famous toy and the values she represents. Another example from our database is law blogger Eric Turkewitz's use of the Avis and Hertz logos in a blog post about a lawsuit involving these two companies. (Note, however, that there is some question about whether using a logo, rather than just a textual reference, would qualify as a fair use under the three-part test outlined above.) &gt;  &gt; also: &gt;  &gt; &gt;First Amendment Defenses: Courts have recognized a number of additional ""First Amendment"" defenses in particular situations. For example, in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a filmmaker could use Ginger Rogers' trademark (her name) in the title of a film called ""Ginger and Fred,"" even though the film was not primarily about Rogers. The court indicated that trademark law should be applied to artistic works ""only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" The specific details of these defenses is beyond the scope of this guide; the point to keep in mind is that courts may act to protect your right of free expression even if what you are doing doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories above. &gt;  &gt; My own view, which is not informed by any specific case history and is not that of a lawyer, is that it's probably fine. &gt;  &gt; At the end of the day, trademarked products are part of our society and culture.  The point of a trademark isn't to keep you from *talking* about something, but to keep you from *misrepresenting* yourself as being the creator of a production.  Avoiding misrepresentation is essential to permit building reputation.  Building reputation is important for our markets to function, for people to be able to choose to purchase products from someone who they have been happy with in the past. &gt;  &gt; If it's illegal for someone else to sell cereal under the name ""Wheaties"", as trademark law provides, then people can build up reputation associated with those Wheaties and know that, for example, cereal sold as ""Wheaties"" means that a product is of high quality and is satisfactory. &gt;  &gt; But that doesn't mean that you can't write a book or have a reality TV show or so forth in which the main character eats Wheaties for breakfast.  It's obvious there that the reality TV show isn't part of the Wheaties product line. &gt;  &gt; Now, all that being said, there should also be no possibility of confusion that the owner of the trademark is endorsing your own product.  A standard legal CYA (probably not necessary for the use you're making, but strengthens a legal position by providing an argument) may be to include the boilerplate stuff that you [may have seen on ads or other things that reference trademarks of someone else](http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/fair-play/): &gt;  &gt; &gt; ""LEGO¬Æis a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site"".  &gt;  &gt; I probably wouldn't list the ""Colt Bushmaster"" on the packaging or wherever where you don't want to make that disclaimer available without a purchase; again probably not a hard requirement, but strengthens your legal position.  And I would not use the Colt logo in the description, but simply the text.  You're simply describing a real-world gun to the user, and you need to use the text to make it clear which you are talking about. &gt;  &gt; The only minor point of confusion ‚Äî and I'm not familiar with the case law here ‚Äî is that there *are* license games that *do* specifically enjoy being able to claim that they are endorsed by the licensee, especially sports games and (closer to this) driving games, to the point that driving games routinely *do* license the car.  Whether-or-not requiring driving licenses would hold up in court, Ferrari *has* C&amp;Ded game creators who [don't have licenses](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/2115416771.shtml).  Note that Ferrari can claim whatever they want; just because Ferrari does this doesn't mean that they would prevail in a lawsuit.  But I suspect that most people don't want to hassle with Ferrari on the point of a lawsuit. &gt;  &gt; There have been numerous commercial games in the past, like *Jagged Alliance 2*, which have referenced many weapons, and I strongly doubt that they went out to gun manufacturers and tried to get licenses. &gt;  &gt; EDIT: Please note that I am referring to law in the United States.  If you're dealing with some different jurisdiction, I've no idea how closely things run to the US. ",¬Æ

Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game we have yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles. In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs.  This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete.",¬Æ

Oblivion offers certain questlines that are great if not better than Skyrim's (i.e. Thieve's Guild and Dark Brotherhood).  What I personally like best about Oblivion is the mod community that offers graphical HD improvements, innovative spells, more vast cities, bug fixes, UI changes, new shops, etc.  If you get the Oblivion as GOTY or GOTY deluxe, you will be rewarded with much more content, including the Shivering Isles Expansion that adds a new world for you to explore with more quests and items to keep you busy.  I had to scour peoples' Steam inventories just to obtain myself a cheap copy this Summer sale.

If not here it is:  &gt;Background  &gt;Very low carbohydrate ketogenic type diets (VLCKD) have been shown to be more effective for body weight reduction and fat loss compared to balanced or low-calorie Mediterranean diets, at least in the short-medium term [1,2], although the underlying mechanisms of its efficacy are still not well understood. Despite being a diet in widespread use there are few data available regarding effects on respiratory ratio (RR) [3,4] and resting energy expenditure (REE) and, more specifically, there are no reports about the effects on RR following a return to a non ketogenic diet. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 20 day ketogenic Mediterranean diet with phytoextracts (KEMEPHY) and a low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD) on RR and REE during and 20 days after finishing the ketogenic phase. &gt; &gt;Materials and methods  &gt;Forty healthy, overweight subjects were recruited and randomly divided into two groups: MD (age 46.61 ¬± 14.6, BMI 26.8¬±2.6, weight 76.3¬±9.9 kg ) and KEMEPHY (age 50.63 ¬±11.6, BMI 28.8¬±2.8, weight 81.8¬±11.6 kg). KEMEPHY group followed a ketogenic diet (&lt;30g/day of carbohydrates) using meals that mimic the aspect and the taste of carbohydrates but with virtually zero CHO and with phytoextracts (Tisanoreica¬Æ, Lonigo, Italy); after 20 days of strictly KD subjects followed a low carbohydrate non ketogenic diet for 20 days. The MD group followed a standard low-calorie Mediterranean diet (tot Kcal). REE and RR, together with body weight and body composition, were measured in the morning after overnight fasting at the start of the study and after 20 (t20) and 40 days (t40). An Anova test for repeated measures and unpaired t-test with Welch‚Äôs correction were performed when appropriate. &gt; &gt;Results  &gt;Compared to starting values RR was significantly decreased in the KEMEPHY group after 20 days (p&lt;0.05) and after 40 days (p=0.0002) (0.86¬±0.06; 0.79¬±0.05; 0.76¬±0.08; respectively) whilst no significant differences were detected in RR in the MED group. No significant differences in REE were detected. Both groups showed a significant decrease in body weight at t20 and t40 compared to basal conditions (KEMEPHY basal 81.8¬±11.6; t20 77.8¬±11.4; t40 75¬±11.2. MED basal 76.3¬±9.9; t20 75.6¬±9.9; 71.7¬±9.8) with the percentage changes in body weight being significantly greater for the KEMEPHY group. Both groups showed a significant decrease in body fat mass at t20 and t40 compared to basal conditions with the percentage changes in body fat mass being significantly greater for the KEMEPHY group (P=0.0135). &gt; &gt;Conclusions  &gt;These preliminary data showed that whilst both diet protocols lead to a significant decrease in body weight, the reduction was significantly greater during KEMEPHY. The KEMEPHY diet also lead to a lowering of RR and increased fat oxidation at rest without any effect on REE. These findings suggest that one of the main weight loss mechanisms of KD might be attributed to an improvement in resting nutrient oxidation and interestingly this effect was long lasting, at least for up to 20 days following cessation of the ketogenic. Data on metabolic effects of KEMEPHY 3 months the ketogenic period will soon be available. &gt; &gt;References  &gt;Volek JS, Sharman MJ: Cardiovascular and hormonal aspects of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets. &gt;Obes Res 2004, 12(Suppl 2):115S-23S.

""Bayani! Oy! Bayani!""   Bayani was a little hard of hearing, but he could tell someone was trying to get his attention by the flock of crows that spontaneously took off to the sky. He looked around.   ""Bayani! Get out of the field now! Your son! Your son Amado is back!""   It was Bayani's wife, Chesa. She had a dark complexion with hard-earned wrinkles, just like Bayani did. Her worn out t-shirt still had some dirt kicked up by Mary, the family cow she was tending to. That didn't matter, because Amado was back.   ""*Ano daw?*"" Bayani responded. He couldn't make out what his wife just said. ""AMADO! He's back from the city! He has graduated!""   ""*Ah...talaga?*"" Bayani smiled. He straighten his back, and trudged through the muddy field.  ""*Tatay!*"" Amado yelled to his father.   Bayani could only smile as he slowly made his way to his son.   ""You're home?"" Bayani asked. It's obvious what the answer to that question was, but Bayani was overwhelmed with emotion. He didn't know what to say.   ""Yes *tatay*, I'm home. How are you and *nanay*?""   ""Fine."" Bayani gave Amado a good shoulder grab. ""You're all grown up!""   Amado sensed the weakness in his *tatay's* hands. It had been 4 years since Amado left the village to attend college, and *tatay* looked a lot older, and tired. Amado's heart was slightly pained at the thought of that.   ""*Tatay*, let's take a picture."" Amado took out his Samsung Galaxy S4‚Ñ¢ mobile smartphone.   ""*Nanay*, can you take a picture of us? Hold it like this, and press this button here.""   ""That's a button?"" *Nanay* had seen a smartphone before, but she had never used one.   ""Yes, *nanay*. Just touch it, and pull your finger away quickly.""   Bayani protested. He wanted to get a change of clothes. He got a new t-shirt from the flee market last year. He had never worn it, because he wanted to save it for special occasions. Special occasions like this.   ""That's okay *tatay*. You don't have to."" This was perhaps Bayani's second time in his life having his picture taken. He's evidently nervous, judging by his tight grip on his shirt.   ""Ready? *Isa...dalawa...tatlo!*""    **snap**    And right then, the sky cleared up, blessing the village with their much needed *arawan*. A feast would be had that day, and it would be a big one.

The veteran officers each held full-time positions with the south suburban department while working security details that paid $19 to $25 an hour for two school districts, according to public records obtained by the newspaper.  The Tribune review found scores of unexplained inconsistencies in which the officers were reported on duty in Harvey during the same hours they were also getting paid to watch over school halls and sporting events miles away.  The records raise questions about why their bosses took so long to investigate. Harvey officials were tipped off to possible payroll discrepancies in 2011, yet they waited to take key steps to investigate the allegations until after the Tribune requested copies of time cards this summer.  The time cards for one of the officers, Cmdr. Roy Wells, 52, suggest he may have overlapped at least 200 hours since 2008, the equivalent of five full-time weeks of work. For example, on one day, he was paid for working 22 hours for the three agencies during one 24-hour period, the time cards show.  The other officer ‚Äî Steven Porter, 52 ‚Äî was Harvey's senior police investigator in internal affairs, a role that made him one of the agency's top ethics watchdogs. His time cards showed overlap of at least 120 hours since 2008, the equivalent of three full-time weeks.  Wells and Porter told the Tribune they were honest about their hours and suspect some of their time cards have mistaken entries.  Wells was paid $75,000 a year by Harvey and collected as much as $28,000 a year from the districts. He said there was ""a very good explanation"" for the discrepancies and that he expects to be vindicated.  Porter was paid $67,000 a year by Harvey and collected as much as $12,000 a year from the districts. Porter said he ""acted appropriately"" at all times.  ""Look, I don't cheat on my job,"" Porter said. ""I'm 28 years on the job. No way I'm going to throw away my career.""  Harvey police said they've contacted the Cook County State's Attorney's office about the suspected payroll irregularities. Prosecutors declined to comment.  Three places at once?  The Tribune obtained pay and timekeeping records for Wells and Porter from Harvey police, Rich Township High School District 227 and Homewood-Flossmoor High School District 233 through the open records act.  To allow for the possibility of small differences between the various employers' time clocks, the newspaper's review focused on dates in which someone clocked into a second job at least a half-hour before he clocked out of the first.  The analysis of the time cards from 2008 through May found that:  ‚Ä¢For Wells, there were at least 92 days when he was listed as working in two places at once. The average overlap was more than two hours each day. And there was an overlap in nearly one-third of all days he worked at a school.  On one day in early 2009, Wells' time cards suggest he was in three places at one time. Records show he worked from 8:25 a.m. to 6:39 p.m. in Harvey, but started shifts at both high schools at 4:30 p.m.  The time cards said he worked until 6:30 p.m. at Rich Township, and until 10 p.m. at Homewood-Flossmoor.  ‚Ä¢For Porter, there were at least 101 days when time cards indicated he was in two places at once, with an average overlap of more than an hour. And there was an overlap in more than one-third of all days he worked at a school.  On a Tuesday in March 2010, time cards indicated he worked a full day at Harvey, clocking out at 5 p.m., but not before he started a 4 p.m. shift at Homewood-Flossmoor. That shift is shown lasting until 10 p.m., but he also started another shift at Rich Township at 6 p.m., which also lasted until 10 p.m., according to records.  Wells was asked about some discrepancies last year as part of a civil case. He said he sometimes worked in a Rich Township school for a few hours in the morning and then for a few hours later that same day.  Wells said Rich Township's computer system required that he submit his hours as if he worked them all in a row. That could explain, he said, why his time cards would suggest a discrepancy when there wasn't one.  Wells said the school told him to log his hours that way, but also to keep his own private record of the actual times and dates he worked.  Rich Township did not respond to requests to address Wells' explanation.  In any event, his testimony didn't explain repeated shift overlaps between the other school district and Harvey.  Harvey police use a hand scanner to record in and out times, while at Homewood-Flossmoor the time cards were written out by hand. School district spokeswoman Jodi Bryant said employees are expected to accurately fill out their cards, including all start and stop times.  ""In light of all the information the Tribune provided, the matter is under review,"" she said.  Wells declined to answer questions when contacted by the newspaper.  Porter said he has ""no idea"" why there would be time card discrepancies.  ""I get off at one job and go to the other one. It takes me 10 minutes to go from Harvey police headquarters to Homewood-Flossmoor,"" he said, before declining further comment.  For its part, Harvey issued a statement saying it has ""zero tolerance for police corruption or misconduct by any of its employees.""  But a Tribune review of court records raises questions about why the department waited until this spring to start investigating the matter.  Slow to act  The time card allegations became intertwined with an expansive wrongful termination lawsuit filed by a fired Harvey officer, Andre Sneed.  Harvey said it dismissed Sneed for faking an injury. He also had been mentioned, but not charged, in a federal corruption case targeting officers providing security for drug dealers.  Sneed's lawsuit alleged department brass lied in ways that unfairly implicated officers in the drug case, and Sneed said he was fired for complaining about that and other alleged misconduct.  Tucked into Sneed's 2011 legal filings was a complaint that the suburb ignored his allegation of payroll fraud among top brass. He also complained that the suburb refused to give him payroll records as required by the state's open records law so he could investigate.  Nearly two years later, Sneed introduced records ‚Äî in front of the suburb's lawyer ‚Äî that allegedly showed the payroll discrepancies at two different school districts. But Harvey police did not open an internal investigation then either.  In March, Sneed forced acting Chief Denard Eaves to answer questions under oath regarding what he knew about alleged ghost payrolling.  Eaves said he had ""no knowledge"" of the allegations.  Eaves' spokeswoman, Sandra Alvarado, wouldn't discuss how her boss could not have known of the payroll allegations sooner.  In April, Sneed said, the suburb granted his long-standing request for department pay records. That made it possible to compare shift overlaps for all three agencies.  Around the same time, Alvarado said, the department contacted prosecutors and launched an internal probe. But the Tribune found the department waited until July ‚Äî a day after the Tribune began asking questions ‚Äî to gather most of the pay records from the two school districts.  On July 5, according to Harvey police, both Wells and Porter were reassigned. Wells was put on ""administrative leave"" and retired July 11.  As for Porter, his status is unclear. Alvarado said he was put on ""administrative desk duty"" outside of the internal affairs office.  But Porter last week told the Tribune he had not been disciplined or reassigned and remained an internal affairs investigator.

That differentiator can be anything (such as humans over 1 meter tall), or something more nebulous ""bad-decision making = decision making with an ignorance level of 0.5 or higher) but many differentiators won't make sense in achieving the ends most humans care about and many won't be convincing to others.  I think a lot of the search for the **One True Moral System‚Ñ¢** has to do with the drive to convince others (and oneself). If a moral rule has a bunch of conditions, the rule *seem* more arbitrary (don't kill except if someone in a uniform tells you or you feel threatened as defined by ___ or it's an accident which reasonable people couldn't have seen coming or...) versus ""THOU SHALT NOT KILL!""  Even though pretty much no one practices such non-nuanced forms, they still purport that those forms are correct so as to convince others (and themselves). But it's bullshit and it's inconsistent and [I don't grant people a right to be wrong](http://www.justopia.org/you-dont-have-a-right-to-be-wrong.html).",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1374526165,"&gt;not that slavery is bad and you shouldn't do it... but what you should pay for them? (That's in the New Testament, by the way.)  Indeed, there's an *entire book of the Bible* about a slave who escapes from his cruel master, and runs to Paul for sanctuary. Paul sends him right back, with a letter asking his master to please not beat him *too hard*.  I'm going to take a wild guess at OP's response.    I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;""These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

Edit:  Sorry, got data confused with other stuff I'd been looking at.  &gt; The largest contributors to net revenue in fiscal year 2013 were Borderlands 2, NBA 2K13, BioShock Infinite, Max Payne¬Æ 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, XCOM¬Æ: Enemy Unknown and Red Dead Redemption. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 148% year-over-year and accounted for 22% of Non-GAAP net revenue, driven by offerings for Borderlands 2, the Grand Theft Auto franchise, NBA 2K13, Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization V and XCOM: Enemy Unknown.     from [here](http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1818758&amp;highlight=) This means that digital sales from sources like steam and GMG and so on account for 22% of take two's revenue",¬Æ

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1374593596," Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;""These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh03,whatmockingbird,1374599264,"**FOLLOW UP** Dear Whatmockingbird,  Thanks for getting in touch with us.  Your LEGO¬Æ Die Hard Series sounds great and we're happy you took the time to share your idea with us. I know this might be difficult to hear, but at the moment we can‚Äôt accept suggestions about what fans want us to make for new LEGO toys.  I'm sure that this rule may seem rigid, especially for someone who simply has a great idea they wish to share with us.  However, for legal reasons, we have to follow this policy to avoid confusion about the origin of LEGO toys.  Our experts in Denmark work day and night dreaming up new LEGO sets, themes and toys. This means we might already be working on something like you've suggested. It sometimes takes years to plan everything from the first brick to the last. They have to test their ideas, figure out the best way to build them, get the pieces from the factory, work out what sort of box is needed and then find a way to get the new sets to all the shops in 130 countries. It‚Äôs quite a process.  But we really do value suggestions from our fans so I‚Äôm happy to tell you we‚Äôre already working on a website that will let you share your ideas with us. You‚Äôll also be able to admire the ideas of other LEGO fans and even get votes that could lead to making your idea a reality. When you have some time, check out LEGO.CUUSOO.com. I hope you‚Äôll have some fun there and let your imagination run wild!  Thanks again for getting in touch. We're always pleased to receive feedback from LEGO fans! If you could take a moment to complete a four question survey by going to the link below, it will help us make sure we are providing the best customer service to you.  http://www.econsumeraffairs.com/lsi/ensurvey.html?F1=033679743A  Please let us know if you need anything else.

You didn't break up with this girl to ""save her"". That's a load of shit. It was some manipulation on your part. It failed and you got what you deserved (see #7). 1. Love is not 'pure' or 'true'.

Your girlfriend wasn't your girlfriend, or your wife for that matter, when she decided to be some guys sock to jerk-off into. That's her business, and not yours.  1. The reason the pain does not go away is because you know that your girlfriend has been 'dirtied up'. You are thinking that her hole has now been sullied and is no longer worth what it used to be. You are thinking that a woman's worth is equal to her pussy, divided by the number of unique dicks that have been inside it. This is why you hurt so much.

""This woman's pussy is pretty much a urinal."". Then he remembered a little bit about her having a boyfriend, felt pleased and superior, then spent his load.  Here's what I want you to do:  1.

t5_2vadq,headlessparrot,1374632174,"Crown Royal Reserve used to be known as Crown Royal Special Reserve (it‚Äôs the same recipe, according to the company); amusingly, even several years after the name change, the Reserve bottle caps *still* [say the old name of the whisky](http://i.imgur.com/hIY02al.jpg) (they must have had quite a supply of those crown screw top caps). It‚Äôs also got to be one of *the* most divisive whiskies currently in the reddit whisky database‚Äîonly four reviews, and scores ranging from the high 30s to the low 90s. Curious. Maybe we can shed some light on that.  **Crown Royal Reserve Canadian Whisky**; No Age Statement (but made from ‚Äúless than 1% of the Crown Royal supply,‚Äù with the very best barrels being set aside for additional aging); 40% ABV; 750mL; retails for about $48 Cdn. in the province of Alberta.  **Appearance:** Unless it‚Äôs from a micro-distillery or explicitly says so, you can pretty well always assume e150a with Canadian whisky, and this is no exception. Fairly thin body. *Love* the bottle, though (it‚Äôs leaps and bounds above the standard Crown and the Limited Edition, just aesthetically speaking). If there‚Äôs one thing Crown does well, it‚Äôs the branding.  **Nose:** Initially, I get that sort of bourbon-lite‚Ñ¢ character that I suspect has always made Crown so popular in the US (that sort of oaky, corny, vanilla quality), though with the rough edges of the standard Crown evened out considerably. Less sweet than standard Crown. Quite restrained. But behind that there‚Äôs some orange peel, and some hints toward a bumped-up rye quotient here‚Äîit‚Äôs a light, sweet, soft rye, though. Bready. When you get your nose in just the right position, there‚Äôs a nice mixture of sweet, sour, and spicy rye that‚Äôs really nice (just ever so mild shades of Lot 40)‚Äîbut it‚Äôs really elusive, and weak, and god do I wish they‚Äôd bottle this stuff at 45% or even 43%. Some red fruits‚Äîberries. Toffee. Maple. Pickles? Grass or hay. It does benefit from time in a way that I wasn‚Äôt suspecting, and it‚Äôs nice, but boy is it restrained and delicate.   **Taste:** Thin, but there is a decent syrupiness to the body. Devastatingly smooth (whether you want to take that in a good way or a bad way). Again, that Crown Royal bourbon-lite‚Ñ¢ of oak tannins, vanilla, and corn. But a nice rye spiciness surrounds it. Again, orange peel. Faintly bready.  **Finish:** Short. Vanishes too quickly. Hints of the rye again (a nice balanced spicy-sweetness). Toasted wood, vanilla. Nice balance, but it‚Äôs a there-and-gone sort of thing. You can tell the market segment being targeted here, the kind of person for whom ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù is key.  **Final Thoughts:** This is a whisky with real potential that ultimately and sadly falls short, and is afraid to step out of the Canadian whisky stereotype. That faint hint of some real, actual interesting rye character is *really* enticing, but the strength just isn‚Äôt there to make it come out in a real direct way, and that makes me sad. At the same time, here‚Äôs the weird thing: despite its shortcomings, I *really* enjoyed drinking this, and I‚Äôm having trouble explaining exactly why‚Äîperhaps the case of a good whisky that just doesn‚Äôt fit with what I wanted of it (there‚Äôs no doubt the smoothness and balance of this guy are a deliberate decision geared to a specific audience, and the Master Blender certainly deserves credit for retaining the CR character while smoothing out the edges *and* adding an extra shot of flavour). Or perhaps‚Äîthough I‚Äôve never had this particular CR expression before‚Äîit‚Äôs a kind of pseudo-nostalgia factor, where I sip this and experience a warped memory of what I desperately *wanted* the regular Crown to taste like when I was younger? I don‚Äôt know, but there‚Äôs something weirdly likeable here that I‚Äôm having trouble putting my finger on.   Of course it‚Äôs worth mentioning here as well that the plot thickens, and that there may be an explanation for some of the wild variance of scores between reviews here other than different tastes: because, rumours are circulating in a few places on the Web (particularly on [Whisky Connosr](http://www.connosr.com/reviews/crown-royal/crown-royal-reserve/an-exceptional-batch-only/)) that the Reserve is somewhat schizophrenic, and that there may be pretty significant variations from batch-to-batch that the company isn‚Äôt acknowledging‚Äîwith batches apparently ranging from all-out rye bombs to fairly mute refinements of the standard Crown Royal character. If those stories are true, it‚Äôs certainly interesting, and I‚Äôd certainly love to get my hands on a bottle from a batch that I‚Äôve heard some people rave about. This‚Äîthough again, in a strange way I still rather like it‚Äîisn‚Äôt that batch.   **Score:** 82 ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,tabius,1374646658,"&gt; I love a friendly debate so please don't feel as if you're going to offend me at all.  Awesome. Likewise.  &gt; When I say the word soul, I am not referring to a the religious, everlasting, someday going to heaven, soul that the word typically means. I mean simply that the universe has a consciousness that would have to have been existing outside the human body in order for our awareness to become possible at all.  If I understand this correctly, you're making a fairly strong claim about the way the world is without any good evidence for it, or even evidence that there are things that our current (admittedly incomplete and provisional) neurological explanations do not account for that this idea does. I'm not claiming that the current state of scientific research into awareness and subjective experience is The Truth‚Ñ¢. But I am saying that if you are basing your ethical positions off an idea that is incompatible with our best current scientific understanding, you are the one who needs to do the work to show the evidence supporting that position.  &gt; However my point was not to claim the existence of a soul at all, but rather to say that what we consider a human life and wouldn't dream of killing, is still at the very least a potential for said human life while inside the womb.  Potential is the key word here. You're a potential millionaire, but if I don't actively seek a winning lottery ticket to give to you, I'm not depriving you of anything.  &gt; This is what my problem is with a lot of people who claim that they know too much of anything science-related as a matter of fact, not to say you are who I'm referring to. Science is not about claiming something as being fact without further experimentation or investigation, it is about searching endlessly for change.  Feel free to aim this remark directly at me. Yes, I will claim that scientific knowledge tells us specific things, though it's not always appropriate to describe those things as facts. Most importantly, it tells us when a plausible-seeming ideas can't possibly be true (because we have reliable evidence from the world that is inconsistent with that idea). I never said that the best ideas from neuroscience and psychology shouldn't be refined with further investigation and evidence; my position is that we are most justified in relying on *the best ideas we already have* than anything else on the subject. Unless you have specific evidence specifically showing specific errors in these ideas, a vague notion of ""we can't let our ideas stand still"" isn't a good reason to disbelieve the best conclusions we can form with the evidence we do have to hand.   &gt; In reality, there are more things about the universe and even our own planet that we do not know in comparison to what we do. Although it may seem like backwards reasoning, I always think that the possibility of something happening are perhaps slightly greater than the chances that it is impossible. Because what do we really know anyway?  I disagree with this on several levels. There are a great many things that we have only a rough understanding of, but most phenomena we encounter in our lives are quite well understood, and a goodly range of things beyond those are also well understood. Your claim about possibility compared to impossibility is... ill posed. When you actually look at the best knowledge we have been able to find in any area, it is usually quantitive, and a good theory will enable us to assign likelihoods to various observations. The idea that *any* occurrence is *always* likely to have a non-zero probability in the best theory covering that occurrence is not consistent with this.  But even where we're wrong - and we're certainly going to be wrong about some things - we are only justified in using the best estimates of likelihood available to us on a given question. The current best understandings of awareness would assign the probability that a single cell has anything like what we would call awareness at all is approximately zero. If you have actual evidence to the contrary, feel free to present it, but otherwise you are using speculative intuition in preference to the best available explanations of the world. This is epistemically untenable, and an example of faulty reasoning. We can't be *certain* of anything, but it is a total non-sequitur to imply that this means that all ideas are equally plausible.  &gt; I believe in some sense that emotions, feeling, instinct, and intuition do make up at least one's own answers to ethical questions.  Yes, this is how people do evaluate choices with an ethical component. It doesn't imply that every conclusion that everyone reaches based on these evaluations is sound, particularly when people often come to different conclusions.  &gt; For example, and let's put aside laws and religious text, why is it considered wrong to kill an innocent person?  I would argue that (inasmuch as people's views line up with valid reasoning) it's because that person has a conscious interest in their continued existence, that they will likely suffer during their murder, that killing them extinguishes their legitimate goals and plans for the future, that an increased rate of arbitrary deaths of innocent people makes everyone else in the community feel less secure and happy in their lives, and most importantly, because of the terrible grief their death would cause to their loved ones. As I've been alluding to, I don't agree that *acts* or *character* are the correct targets for optimization in ethical questions, and processes that attempt to find solutions on this basis are thus faulty. It is *consequences* that matter. A world with more arbitrary murder of innocents is worse than one with less, and so we should try to seek circumstances that minimize this.  &gt; But I don't think that ""Are all men with mustaches evil"" should be considered an ethical question at all. That is simply an error in judgement, not in ethics.  But isn't ""is what that man is doing wrong?"" an ethical question? If it is possible for ethical reasoning to yield results at all (and it seems to be, I think you and I are meaningfully communicating about the reasoning used to arrive at ethical positions) then it must be possible to attempt to apply that reasoning but make mistakes. Let's take another example: the New Testament contains the [Blood Libel](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/mt/27.html#25). This led Christians to claim justification in persecuting Jews for thousands of years, yet it is based on the judgement that an entire ethnicity can bear guilt for the alleged actions of some members of it. What is this if not faulty reasoning, leading to a mistaken ethical position?  &gt; While I may be mistaken in your eyes, I feel there is never any clean cut answer on an ethical question, regardless of the context. We will all have different answers and in the grand scheme of things there is no one to say what is ""right"" or ""wrong.""  I agree with you that we can't be sure when we've reached the ""right"" answer on most ethical questions. But some questions have narrow enough ranges of answers that are now sufficiently obvious (e.g. that genocide and slavery are undesirable) that it's kind of perverse to say there's no ""right or wrong"" answer to them.  While I think you do have errors in how you have reached and justified your position, and thus that your position is mistaken, I am not claiming that this is a-priori the case for opposition to abortion. But I've not seen any instances of opposition that I think has a strong case, and I am very far from dissuaded that ethical positions in general should be somehow free from critical evaluation as containing errors.",‚Ñ¢

THINK ALSO OF THE FEMA CAMPS! *EVANGELICAL ENDTIMESPACE YOUTUBE CHANNEL *+* Please share and do not change ¬© BC                                   Full view:  Hello, very welcome! On July 11th, 2013, the angel of the Lord brought on this message of God to prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, God's end-time prophet. These prophetic revelations and fulfillments of God are all faithful and veritable. All that the Lord God brings on to Benjamin Cousijnsen, is being passed on, word for word, in the presence of the angels of God, to His prophet. You must know, even though you might already know a lot, or perhaps nothing at all about the end times, or about the truths which God does reveal now, you must know that everything is true. And I also advise anyone in the world, whether you‚Äôre familiar with the word of God or not, to take these words seriously in this time, and to seek God. For these are truly the last days. And I also pray for you, that you may understand the truth, and the truth shall make you free. I‚Äôll start with the message now.  Shalom! I greet you in the mighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Reliasa and I am the messenger angel of God.  Verily, also your data are located in the U.S.   On a large scale one is being monitored via the internet communication, totally! including via Facebook, YouTube, Hyves, Skype, Yahoo, Google... one even knows your computer login details, and which sites you saw, and which emails you sent. Verily, the antichrist Obama even reads your post mail, and also your phone calls are recorded and monitored by the U.S.! And through your passport, telephone, and television, and via your chip card, you are being monitored, when you login and logout, when you go on a journey...  Many Americans have already been chipped, even under duress!  Read aloud: Revelation 13, verse 7, and read also Revelation 13, verse 16 to 18 Revelation 13, verse 7  Here it is written:  It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him. Revelation 13, verse 16 to 18  Here it is written: He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads; and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Not only the U.S. is monitoring on a large scale, but also Russia is spying on the Netherlands and France. One monitors humans, even with satellites!  Verily, Obama is telling you, this is a good weapon, in order to protect you. Extensive use is made of the technological knowledge of the fallen angels. The money will disappear, and Obama will be glad that, in that way, one will totally choose for the chip in your skin. Another soul for hell!  Verily, the attacks on banks will lead to it, that one will choose for 666, the number of the beast, and the total control! The true reason is, that the antichrist will know, where the Christians, who are called 'haters' and 'extremists', are to be found! Think also of the FEMA camps.  Read aloud: John 3, verse 16  Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Verily, you are also monitored, but then in your heart. I'm going now, spoke the messenger angel of God, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom!

I greet you in the almighty Name above all names, which is very great and mighty and powerful. In His name, I come, in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Thunder.    Hear attentively!  Read aloud: Genesis 3, verse 8 to 11  Here it is written: They heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. And the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù The man said, ‚ÄúI heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.‚Äù God said, ‚ÄúWho told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?‚Äù The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, China, Korea, Spain, Mexico, America, Iraq, Africa, Indonesia, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Netherlands! Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen warned you since 2012. Verily, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob sent me, Thunder. Also, Syria and Turkey were warned, because of disobedience and dragon worship and idolatry! I, Thunder, had to cause also lot of damage to Tokyo, and many perished.  And God opened the floodgates, and there never fell yet as much water as in 2013! Benjamin told you yet: One will remember 2013 well! I, Thunder, brought you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, many warnings. See also, what I brought to many countries now. But okay, your choice is your choice! But God's choice is clearer and stands firm! He says to you, He who does not want to hear, will perish.  This counts for all countries! Make no mess of your country. I, Thunder, will visit each country. In hell is fire, and the earth is already a mirror of hell.  Exodus 11, verse 6  There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.  Verily, read aloud: Exodus 22, verse 20  Here it is written: He who sacrifices to any god, except to the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  The Lord warned all countries through prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen!  Read aloud: Exodus 23, verse 20 to 21, and verse 24 to 26 Exodus 23, verse 20 to 21  Here it is written: Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Don‚Äôt provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him. And verse 24 to 26  You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars. You shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst. No one will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days. The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Verily, this is a promise to you, and still you do not listen. Benjamin Cousijnsen says this: ""I am the voice of one, crying: Make straight your paths, destroy every idol and repent! Have remorse! Return to the holy Scriptures of God and obey His commandments."" Verily, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, Isa, says to you today:  John 3, verse 16 and 17  Read this aloud. Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God didn‚Äôt send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.  The messenger angel of God spoke further,  Yet briefly... if you do not listen, the world and your country will be leveled, and God will say: satan is under My foot! See, what‚Äôs coming now!     Read aloud: Sirach 10, verse 12 to 17  There it is written: Pride has its beginning when a person abandons the Lord, his maker. Pride is like a fountain pouring out sin, and whoever persists in it will be full of wickedness. That is why the Lord brought terrible punishments on some people and completely destroyed them. The Lord has overthrown kings and put humbler people in their place. The Lord has pulled up nations by the roots and established humbler ones in their place. The Lord has overthrown empires and completely devastated their lands. He destroyed some so completely that they are not even remembered any more.

This will be my first niece or nephew, so I really wanted to do something special.  I moved to Italy in 2007 after uni because said sister was studying there and I had sweet feck all else to do. She was doing art history and we used to do gallery walks together and one of our favorite artists who was often on show was an Italian textile artist named Alighiero Boetti who designed and organized the production of these [amazing embroidered tapestries](http://blog.best-bookings.com/en/files/2012/01/Alighiero-Boetti-linsensata-corsa.jpg), a lot of them dominated by [bold-colored letters](http://luxe.psychologies.com/signes_et_ecritures/images/2008/10/24/alighiero_boetti.jpg) which would spell out words, phrases and idiomatic expressions in Italian and other languages.  I honestly woke up in a eureka moment one morning with the idea that I needed to make one of these for her baby blanket. I'm using [this tapestry](http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/moma_boetti_untitlednerosubianco_1989.jpeg) as inspiration for both the layout and color scheme. I've charted out each letter to a 17 stitch x 22 row square and am double knitting each letter as a separate quilt square with each letter. EDIT: Forgot to include that the yarn I'm using for the letters is [Mondial Merinos Extra](http://www.lanemondial.it/sito/images/stories/cartelle_colore/m.extra.jpg) because of the weight, color range and machine-washable-ness.  Each letter section is 4x4 for a total of 16 squares. I've chosen meaningful phrases -- Italian ""ninni nanni"" that my grandma and grandpa used to sing with us, favorite song lyrics that are connected with our mom and dad, and a square of fun verbs (to get some of the letters not featured in the other squares). Holy shit that was time consuming. I wanted to make sure that I had all of the letters of her name, her fianc√©'s name, and the proposed names for either sex they've chosen, while having the squares have some kind of meaning! Soo... it will be:          VOCA    ALLY         VOCA    OUNE         MARI    EDIS         NARU    LOVE          SING    BATT         OUTA    IMAN         NDBE    INI‚ô•         FREE    BABY          YOUA    JUMP         REMY    SKIP         SUNS    RUND         HINE    ANCE  I'm then grafting tops to bottoms and stitching sides to sides to get the square together. I'm thinking of doing the layout as above so it's vertically oriented for easier tummy-time accommodation. The interstitial space will be plain white, probably in a moss stitch with [Mondial Merino Plus](http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/mondial-merino-plus) for quick knittingness, non-rolliness, texture, and washability. So far, out of the 96 squares, I've done 71 with 25 to go. I've been getting 2-3 done per day, so I should be in for my deadline of Sept 3 (heading to the states for the baby shower!).  This is my second soup-to-nuts project (the first being the apple in my rav avatar which I really have to put up one of these days), and it's been really rewarding. I've learned a lot of new things, especially [Judy's Magic Cast On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pmxRDZ-cwo) for starting the squares in pattern, and I've gotten hella good at kitchener stitch, as well. I have to say that I'm kind of reaching the point of tedium with all of these knits and purls and I'll be really ready for more complex shaping patterns after this.

t5_2ryd5,Basilides,1374669754,"&gt;Second, a great wrath is not the same as a divine anger.  NET Bible (¬©2006) So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of **divine anger** against Israel, so they broke off the attack and returned to their homeland.  And here is a particular idiotic attempt at apologetics:  Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary  ""took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering, &amp;c.‚ÄîBy this deed of horror, to which the allied army drove the king of Moab, a divine judgment came upon Israel; that is, the besiegers feared the anger of God, which they had incurred by giving occasion to the human sacrifice forbidden in the law (Le 18:21; 20:3), and hastily raised the siege.""  http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm  So all a besieged enemy had to do was break one of the ten commandments in full view of the Israelite besiegers and the Israelites would flee in fear of the retribution of Yahweh. If only the exterminated Canaanites tribes had known of this Israelite Achilles Heel.  Why do I bother? Christians will come up with any kind of nonsense to defend their nonsense.  &gt;Second, a great wrath is not the same as a divine anger. The word is qetsep, and seems to be used in Kings to indicate human wrath  Except when it is not (see above translation) and...  ""...as I argued in Human Faces of God on pp. 91-92, is that the word *qetsep* (‚Äúwrath‚Äù) refers to divine wrath most often by far, and frequently to a divine wrath which comes upon a congregation, group or nation. Further problematic is that the word *qetsep* does not once refer to the wrath of an army, or to the wrath of a group. Perhaps it might have been used this way, but this is a slender reed, since the biblical usage we have does not support it.""  http://religionatthemargins.com/2011/06/more-on-richard-hess-and-2-kings-327/  &gt;The Lord's portion should be taken to mean a term of endearment and affection. Like in Deut. 18:1-2, where the Levitical priests have the Lord as their inheritance.  Which apologetic liar did you get that from?  Deut 18:2 They shall live on **the food offerings** presented to the Lord, for **that is their inheritance**.   &gt;This is also different in the masoretic text  More sleight of hand. The masoretic text was not written until the Middle Ages. Why should I or anyone else care how it compares to much older texts?  &gt;Interpreting the verse to mean that God was given Israel as his portion is also in conflict with the much more explicit description of the formation of nations, in Genesis 10 and 11.  So your argument here is that the Bible contains no contradictions? You are an inerrantist?  &gt;3) These ""sons of God"" are said to judge over men and die like men in Psalm 82, which would make it better to see them as human rulers.  Or it means that these gods have been proven to be mortal. Because they are dead.  ""Israelite religion had an assembly of heavenly host under the authority of Yahweh. This assembly  has very close affinities to the pantheons of ancient Near East, particularly in Canaanite religion.  The most telling example is the literature from Ras Shamra (Ugarit), discovered in the late 1920s. As  a Semitic language, Ugaritic is closely related to biblical Hebrew, sharing a good deal of vocabulary,  as well as morphological and syntactical features. Upon their decipherment, many of the Ugaritic  tablets were found to contain words and phrases describing a council of gods that are conceptually  and linguistically parallel to the Hebrew Bible. The Ugaritic divine council was led by El, the same  word used in the Hebrew Bible for deity and as the proper name for the God of Israel (e.g., Is 40:18;  43:12). There are explicit references to a council or assembly of El, in some cases overlapping wordfor-word with those in the Hebrew Bible.3  Psalm 82:1 is perhaps the best example, as it employs the expression  ødt  æil(m) (Hebrew: ◊ú ÷µ◊™÷æ◊ê ÷∑◊ì ÷≤◊£) for  the council, along with a transparent reference to gods under the authority of Israel's God: ‚ÄöGod  (◊ô◊ù ÷¥◊ú◊î÷π ÷±◊ê) stands in the council of El/the divine council (◊ú ÷µ◊™÷æ◊ê ÷∑◊ì ÷≤◊£); among the gods (◊ô◊ù ÷¥◊ú◊î÷π ÷±◊ê) he passes  judgment.‚Äõ The second occurrence of ◊ô◊ù ÷¥◊ú◊î÷π ÷±◊ê must be semantically plural due to the preposition ‚Äöin  the midst of.‚Äõ These gods are being judged for their corrupt administration of the nations of the  earth, having been granted that authority at the division of the nations at Babel according to Deut  32:8-9 (LXX, DSS).4 This plurality cannot be explained as human beings.""  http://www.thedivinecouncil.com/Psa82John10.pdf  &gt;This prophecy is entirely contingent upon Israel's willingness to make it happen.  When they don't bring up their end of the bargain, he withdraws.  How did Israel not bring up their end of the bargain?

t5_2xing,DaddyMonster,1374674174,"&gt; In the same thread, some posters will express doubt about a woman who claims to have kept her sexual partner number low  ""Claims"" being the operative word.   &gt; while another would suggest that she is just trying to selfishly use that as leverage to get a higher status guy.  If she's lying or bringing nothing else to the table, that's exactly what she's doing.   &gt; There is rarely any acknowledgement that the woman may have simply done a good thing and resisted this culture of meaningless relationships.  Because it's really damn rare. Also, it's really hard to believe that a healthy young woman would moderate herself when her friends are going at it like rabid dogs.     &gt; Similarly, stories about women who have had a lot of sexual partners are both celebrated and condemned at the same time--more 'sluts' out there riding the penis carousel means that more TRPers are riding in a new pussy wagon every night of the week.  So?   &gt; However, if one of these men meets a woman that isn't into that lifestyle, he makes fun of her on TRP for being a prude in a 'field report'.  I can't remember seeing this. Link please.   &gt; Maybe I'm just not getting it, but it seems like the message is that the idea of The Good Woman can't exist in the minds of RP.  Sure they can, but each and every man determines himself what constitutes a good woman for him. This depends, of course, upon *what he wants the woman for.*  &gt; Any qualities seen as good are only manipulative tools used to further her own personal hypergamy.  I can see the problem here. You're reacting like most women do whenever women *in general* or *women in specific contexts* are criticized by men; you take it personally. This is normal, due to the female tendency to solipsism. Just be aware of this tendency and it'll be less painful.   &gt; Any resistance to hopping on the carousel is a 'shit-test'  Some men are bitter at women, this is true, and they resent female mating strategies. However, in this case, if a woman claims to have resisted the lure of the carousel, she is met with disbelief and skepticism in the TRP because it's so often a lie or in fact a shit test (""I normally don't do this"" - Sure you don't honey...)   &gt; And the funniest thing of all--these men are more than willing to be complicit catalysts in the culture of women they claim they despise, setting up their own RP carousel open for business and using every seduction technique in the book.  RP-men usually hate the system, but if we don't play we get nothing. Besides, if enough women get fucked by the culture they're enforcing with their reproductive choices, and enough men GTOW, there will be a counter-reaction. Until then, don't hate the player. Hate the game.  &gt; Further fucking up a flawed system by feeding it for personal gain is NOT honorable, its not the way of The Good Man.  Most of us *WANTED* to be Good Men‚Ñ¢, but we got so screwed for that it's not even funny. We got *nothing*. Why should we ""do the right thing* when we get punished for it?  &gt; If RPers are so willing to shit on the mistakes of women for causing this mess, I'd ask for men to be accountable as well.  With power comes responsibility. Since women hold the sex card, it's up to women to change the game. Read up on Briffaults law.  By withholding commitment, men are forcing women to consider their actions. The losses will be huge for generations to come, but I'm aware of the game and I can play it. Fuck the rest.    &gt; It almost seems as if TRP and RPWomen have completely opposite goals--TRP is only interested in furthering the culture they claim to hate and revel in it,  No, what happens to the system is irrelevant. We're not out to save the world. RP men are out to live lives that satisfy them and their needs. Those of us who plan on getting kids will eventually snatch up nice young girls who haven't been that corrupted yet, with which we can ""share the wealth"" so to speak.    &gt; while RPWomen is a forum about not being that girl.  If you want a relationship with a good high quality man, *don't be that girl.*  &gt; Maybe there should be another subreddit--RPMen, who seek to separate themselves from the problem rather than feed into it, and approach relationships with more integrity.   You're complaining that many RP men aren't doing ""the right thing""? You mean that which society AND woman punishes us so damn hard for?  You complaints mirror those of the average blue pill guy by the way. ""Why do all the girls I get into relationships with turn into soulless harridans?"", ""Why are all girls complete sluts nowadays?"", ""Why do girls only go for cads?"".    &gt; Leave the 'PUAs' and the 'carousel sluts' to their own shithole to stink in.  Look, what other people do to themselves do not matter. It's painful to internalize that thought, I know, but if people want to screw themselves by destroying their future relationship prospects (the sluts anyways), then let them.   What matters is *you* and the person you eventually decide to spend your life with. What others do *is* irrelevant. Surround yourself with people conducive to your needs and who further your life. It will be symbiotic.  Focus on playing your cards in a way that is advantageous to *you*. Focus on men who behave in line with your needs **and** who you can also keep... This last point is important.  If you want a relationship with a good high quality man who is completely awesome and who lights your loins on fire, then focus on making yourself attractive to such men.  Want to ride the carousel?

A case in point is the celebration of Queen Isabella of Spain with a monument in Laurier Park and Isabelle Ave. on the southern edge of MacDonald Park named after the queen.  Queen Isabella co-signed the Edict of Expulsion on March 31, 1492, which ordered the expulsion of Jews who refused to convert to Catholicism ‚Äî execution was a third alternative for those who didn‚Äôt convert or leave. Years later, Muslims were faced with the same predicament: convert, or leave Spain.  As for monuments and streets celebrating Christopher Columbus: this ‚Äúdiscoverer‚Äù of the Americas organized the slaughter of thousands of First Nations people and the enslavement of others he tried to bring back to Spain.  Monuments such as these have no place in today‚Äôs public parks and should be placed in museums, with their histories critically described.  I‚Äôd like to suggest Isabella Ave be renamed A.M. Klein Ave to commemorate the Montreal Jewish poet and that the Isabella monument be replaced by a sculpture dedicated to the vision of peace among all peoples.

t5_2qh0u,Drago6817,1374683506,"So when you have the clutch depressed the engine is physically disconnected from the transmission, you can select any gear you want which will connect that gear/input shaft to the wheels of the vehicle.  Now lets say you were doing 80mph and selected first while attempting to downshift into 3rd. The transmission is now connected to the wheels spinning 80mph worth of rpm. The input shaft to the transmission thus is now spinning whatever rpm the engine would need to spin in order to go 80 mph in first gear, probably 15,000+  Now when you let the clutch out to reconnect the engine with the transmission, the momentum of the moving car try's to accelerate the engine up to that same 15,000 rpm to match the speed of the engine to that of the wheels and transmission.  If you let it out slowly you can catch it as the car lurches forward and the rpm's skyrocket. However if you're ""shifting mad quick yo‚Ñ¢"" you'll just let the clutch out in one motion thus accelerating the engine instantly up to ~15,000 rpm.   If you're lucky you only bend valves, if you're unlucky you break rods and send pistons flying out of the block. If you're really unlucky the flywheel also explodes and sends shrapnel into the car.    None of that can happen in this car though because the flappy paddles don't let you select a gear that will over rev the engine, you can basically just pound away at the downshift paddle when braking and it will put you in the lowest possible safe gear.",‚Ñ¢

It's a user script for tampermonkey which does those fancy schmancy hit postings (I'll post an example in the comments). This is basically a clone of a windows executable whose name escapes me at the moment. I'm sure you've seen it in /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor at some point...However, it does things a little better (namely getting the quals)...also, compatible with Linux. However, it did not get the TO ratings for you, as the executable did. I fiddled around with it and came up with MTurk Great HIT Export Updated. The major changes from the original: I updated the default template to use reddit syntax instead of vBulletin syntax. I added the TO ratings (accessible by {to_stuff} in your template). I updated the default template to look nicer on reddit. If you want to give it a shot, go for it. If you have problems, let me know and I'll see if I can fix them. I cannot take credit for most of the writing, as I scavenged the code from another userscript. I posted it up myself so that people could start using it, if the original owner wants to step forward and/or take it down, just let me know and I'll be more than glad to do so!

No matter how much Paul Elam wants to say it, this doesn't read like satire, this reads like something he wanted to get out of his chest.  But let's be honest here, let's quote the things the MRAs have said:  ‚òë that is still a far cry from justifying the use of a word as strong as rape.  ‚òë In fact, you may be so emotional about the matter that you are not going to be the most reliable informant of the facts.   ‚òë It is undoubtedly better that you just shut up about the matter ‚Äì go somewhere where we don‚Äôt have to look at you or listen to you complain  ‚òë  So please, give the rape crisis line and everyone else a break while I sort things out.  ‚òë Like that girl at Steubenville; the one who partied a little too hearty and then just happened to be penetrated by some of the guys she was partying with. Opportunistic sex? Yeah. Rape? No, not rape. Not even close.  ‚òë All the outrage I read about the sympathy for the ‚Äúperpetrators‚Äù was way off the mark.   ‚òë But not raped, so let‚Äôs try not to get carried away with the righteous indignation, mmkay?  ‚òë Need I remind you that no so long ago anyone you know would have pointed to the horizon and told you just how obvious it was that the earth was flat? It is still right there for you to see, is it not? Look around you! Isn‚Äôt the earth flat?  I like the last one best because it doesn't make any sense. He's saying this like Mary P. Koss was the inventor through Science that men cannot be raped, instead of it being a cultural baggage from our society. The status quo 30 years ago (and more) was that men could not be raped. That's comparable to ""the earth is flat"", not a new revalation like he's trying to point out.  Why am I even bothering with this guy? They upvoted it to the top. They love him. Even as he supports register-her.com and doxxing of individuals because he doesn't like them.",‚òë

t5_2qhpm,parityprat,1374697725,"From http://www.earthbalancenatural.com/responsibility/palm-oil/: &gt; Thirty percent of our palm oil comes from Brazil. Our Brazil-sourced palm oil is 100% organic and is used in all of our organic products (and because orangutans are not native to South America, the Brazilian palm industry does not adversely impact their wellbeing). The remaining 70% of our palm oil comes from responsible sources in peninsular Malaysia (also a non-native orangutan habitat), which are all members of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the leading global organization developing and implementing global standards for sustainable palm oil production. We insist on continuing assurances from our suppliers that all palm fruit oil purchased for Earth Balance¬Æcomplies with the RSPO policies, and we are committed to terminating any suppliers that violate these policies.  AKA, sustainably harvested, non-orangutan killing palm oil.  There's nothing wrong with educating people, but take a moment and look at your own argument, do some research, come up with viable arguments, and when someone shows you that you're wrong, adjust your argument. Your parent comment made me do research, that's great. I will now pay attention to where companies that I buy from source their palm oil. Now,  /u/maimonides and I have shown you that you are wrong in claiming that ""palm oil is not vegan."" From here on out, if you want to educate people, you should say ""Most palm oil adversely affects animals, here are some links, please do research and avoid unethically sourced palm oil. Here are some alternatives you can use in baking, etc.""  Stop arguing a point that doesn't make sense, and stop making sweeping comments that will make most people roll their eyes and move on - without reasoning behind an argument, people don't look at the actual issue and just move on modus operandi - which is why so many vegans still eat honey.",¬Æ

Big grill in the front for maximum cooling with extractor/louvered hood to remove the most air possible from the engine bay. Due to the wide track, extractor behind the front wheels into the engine bay for the same thing. The minimum possible amount of air being trapped against the firewall, the better. Front splitter. Double deck rear diffuser. Flat lip on the skirts, more downforce. Fixed frame mounted rear wing (like on the Bensopra GTR) instead of trunk mounted.

Congratulations, there's nothing like your first puppy üòä I have a black mouth cur/German shepherd mix named Roux, you can check her out on Instagram @valientekc27.  I've had dogs my whole life and you really do fall in love!  If I could give any advice for a first time puppy owner...no one knows your dog like you do.  If you feel like something's off, or if you can say the phrase, ""He's ok but he/she is just sort of acting weird and not like themselves"", then I would strongly encourage you to bring them to the vet anyway.  Dogs can't tell you that they're hurting, but they will shake.  If you see your dog shaking (not due to storm or other anxiety) it's a sign they are in pain and if it is a virus could attack quickly so, better safe than sorry.  I've seen 3 dogs survive after quick yet moderate symptom onset due to their owners insisting something was wrong.  Sometimes bringing attention to a small or mild symptom (walking weird, change in eating habits, delayed responses) could catch anything from neurological damage to cancer.  I swear I'm not trying to terrify you...I've been on the other side of the coin by just a few hours so...anything I can do to prevent another loss is worth it.

t5_2s30g,AFormidableContender,1374733072,"&gt;I never said they did. But nice straw man.  That's not a straw man at all...I am directly countering your argument. If you say men are entitled for acting uppity after friendzone rejections, because women don't owe sex, neither are you entitled to immunity/safety from their scorn, or vitriol, or friendship in general. If my goal was to get in your pants, and I thought the best way to do that was to be your friend first, I have just as much right to blow you off and run my mouth as you do for rejecting me.   That's not necessarily what a mature man should be doing, but my point stands.    &gt;First of all, you are the one who said that sexual entitlement does not and cannot exist for men. Any men, apparently. If you go back up a few comments, this was about OP's seeming sense of entitlement. You're the one who took a statement about an individual, and made it about all men ever and how no men can possibly feel entitled.  Yes. Exactly...it doesn't exist, nor is it logically possible. **You** are trying to insist it does. I never contradicted my own point. If it came across in that fashion to you, you didn't understand the point that was being made.  &gt;Secondly, stop conflating all women. Just because you chose to listen to a piece of advice from a woman or some specific women (or more likely, movies, which are the worst perpetrators of the ""Do Nice Fawning Things And The Girl Will Love You"" crap) does not mean all women hold hypocritical beliefs.  A bushel of rotten apples with a single ripe doesn't make a redeemable bushel. If women were any good at giving advice, in general, the seduction community wouldn't exist.   &gt; If you're so huffy about inaccurate advice, why are you throwing a shit fit now that a substantial portion of the population is trying to correct that advice?  If you're attempting to allude to women attempting to correct the advice, you're psychotic and I'd like you to hook me up with whatever drugs you're taking.   If you're attempting to allude to men attempting to correct the advice, then I have no idea what you're talking about. I agree lots of men are attempting to fix the issue, but you started this conversation with me, and began talking, what I would consider, the height of feminism vitriole, and womansplaining, so again, no idea what you're talking about. That right there...that's a straw-man.  &gt;""I was told that being nice would earn sex. HOW DARE YOU CONTRADICT THAT ADVICE THAT SOMEONE ELSE GAVE ME YOU HYPOCRITICAL WHORE"".  Because we aren't discussing women who contradict the advice...we're talking about entitlement. The conversation began with /u/FrenchFuck explaining his opinion that he thinks OP is entitled, and proposed the question: ""*Can you be angry, or hate someone who doens't owe you anything*"". I said male sexual entitlement doesn't exist, and yes you can. You said it does exist because women don't owe anyone sex. You've proposed no contradictory belief, nor have you differentiated yourself in any way from any other woman; in fact, you've done more to demonstrate that you the problem I'm talking about, not a solution.  Furthermore, if women's advice is generally bad, which it is, you having a difference of opinion means nothing. If an investor asks banks opinion, and the banks are wrong 9 times out of 10, why the fuck would anyone consult any bank anymore at all? At the end of the day, you are actually partly right, in a small way; the goal here is to teach men not to listen to shitty female advice, but it would also help if you stopped slinging that shit our way too...  &gt;The whole point of pointing out the Nice Guy TM issues is to talk about how that IS NOT what you should do. You can't simultaneously be mad about getting bad advice, and also about being told the advice is bad.  Good, because that's not what anyone is doing here. Glad we agree ‚ô•  &gt;So, do you really think all women are blatantly lying to men for our own entertainment or something? Do you really think that in real life I tell men to just be super duper fawningly nice and doting to girls they hardly know, just so I can laugh at them on the internet? Talk about a persecution complex, bro.  No; You give bad advice because it validates you to give bad advice. The fact that the advice perpetuates a cycle of shame and bullying is far more abstract/secondary to the immediate reality of the situation. Both points are no less important though.  &gt;Women are individuals.  Barely  &gt;Some women don't care. Some women are frustrated with dealing with the shitty attitudes some men have **picked up from some other outside sources.**  Aka, women.   Expand on this, or it's just airy fairy fluff. The only thing that's changed in our modern era is 1) feminism perpetuating blank slate social fallacies and B) Nice Guy^TM'ism as a sexual strategy perpetuated by movies, perpetuated by women.    &gt;Because here's the thing. Plenty of men don't have your problems...  They are not my problems. I haven't had a problem with Nice Guy^tm'ism since highschool. Thanks for the Reddit straw man though. I'm passionate about this topic for a myriad of reasons, none of which being because I am currently a Nice Guy^TM.   &gt;Not everyone stops listening after ""I want a nice guy..."" and focuses only on that and imagines it to be some surefire method of ""sexual strategy"".  No. There is no substance, ever, to stereotypical engendered sexual conversations. Attraction is a value proposition, so no, you're not pulling that card. You know why? Because the second leading cause of Nice Guy^tm'ism is listening to everything women complain about and attempting to be the exact opposite thinking that's a smart plan to getting laid. ""I want a nice guy.....................Who treats me right/who isn't an asshole/who *gets* me/who plays guitar...."" I mean, seriously? that's your argument? That men don't listen enough to women's emotional idealistic banter?  &gt;Your blinders are not my problem, nor are they women's fault. They're your fault.  Flooding a market with false information and declaring ""it's not my fault you didn't know better"" is such a bullshit, irresponsible and pussy counter argument. I love it because it helps my position on gender dynamics, but really...? lol.   &gt;Take that up with ladybonersgw. There are plenty of gorgeous, ""sex-worthy males"" who post there who haven't been getting sex.  Because they do not possess masculine qualities. Only so many women will bang you purely because you look good.   &gt;That is NOT how the world works.  You're not 12. Grow up.   &gt;No one, even an attractive person, can just have sex with whomever they want. Attraction is not universal. It will not always work on whom you want it to work.  Again, no one said this. ",‚ô•

As it's impossible to draw up some kind of Ultimate List‚Ñ¢ of the most important Britons, since you can't exactly measure or quantify someone's influence over the country or the world, this selection is always going to be subjective. That subjectivity determines what fields we want to acknowledge on our currency, and which people within those fields we consider to be important enough to put on our money as representative of this country's contribution to that particular sector: whether it be politics, science, or literature. Women's roles within these fields has often and consistently been overlooked, belittled, or put in the name of a man (see: Eli Whitney's cotton gin, in which his wife actually had a huge role in developing- but who is, of course, ignored). I don't think it's unreasonable that a specific effort is made to represent women to make sure that their contributions aren't forgotten. I understand, however, why you disagree; I am not a big fan of quotas, and I wish there were another way to go about things, but I can't see how women would be represented at all without employing some tactics such as these. I also wish they would introduce some similar considerations for PoC- not necessarily quotas, exactly, but that they would take their significant absence into account. Unfortunately this has not happened yet.  There seems to be a sense of injustice here that Austen was chosen as if over the heads of many well-qualified male candidates for the representative of literature. Why is the contribution of, say, Dickens, who has been suggested as an alternative, more important than that of Austen? What has she failed to do that Dickens succeeded in doing, that would qualify him *so much better* than Austen?",‚Ñ¢

I was referring to this: ""Don't call me an idiot, and I won't call you a spineless, woman-hating cunt, okay? Pinky promise.""  &gt;You broke your pinky promise before you even made it. So why make it?  It wasn't an actual proposal, you dense pillock. ""Pinky promise"" didn't tip you off?  &gt;I'm not middle aged, but please do tell me more about myself.  Sorry, prematurely middle-aged.  &gt;I think you need to settle down. Clearly you're upset by people who don't see things your way. Take a deep breath and go back to your masturbation. Less chance of running in to an opposite opinion that way, no?  Nothing to say, another masturbation joke, and I'm sure I'm about to come across yet more of your whinging claiming that *I'm* the one with nothing to say. Lovely jubbly.  &gt;So? You called for an investigation, didnt you? All their statements to the press are admissable evidence.  &gt;An investigation would aid UKIP's case, since not only does the alleged attacker have an alibi, but there are multiple eyewitness statements that contradict the claims.  Would it? Why are you immediately throwing out the alleged threats and abuse she's received for speaking out? Those would certainly make the statements of UKIP members' look questionable, wouldn't they? Here you are again, taking their side, dismissing her, without even realising it.  &gt;My ilk? What an excellent argument you make...  Yes, your ilk. You and /u/YorkistTory make my arguments for me.  &gt;Why would I be, since I'm trying to make myself clear? I consider their statements to be reputable because there are more of them. So do the courts, incidentally.  Right, of course. What I should have asked is, why do you consider her claims outright false, despite no empirical evidence, and despite not actually having read any of the statements or reports of these UKIP members, who all very much have a vested interest in *not* saying ""yeah we let the lads sexually assault her?""  &gt;Also, the only reason I said 'if she continues to make claims' is because she hasn't pressed charges, she's simply made defamatory claims to the press - but if you'd read the article you'd know that, right?  *Of course*, that's why you said that. There were no insidious undertones there. None at all! Well, you've got me convinced. Wink wink.  &gt;Not really, since you were twisting it out of context. Perhaps that was your attempt at subtlety?  I was, was I? Would you care to elaborate?  &gt;Oh so you're not picking sides, just opposing me? Such a shame then, that you've yet to actually make a relevant point other than accuse me of being a woman hater/ victim blamer. You know ad hominem fallacies don't constitute an argument, right?  *Of course* criticism of your points and highlighting your motivation isn't relevant. This is you backpedalling. Furthermore, what argument do you think I'm supposed to be making? I *began* this discussion by criticising your attitude toward alleged sexual assault victims, and more surreptitiously, women. You're only now crying about it? Desperation.  &gt;Yes it is. And you are a wanker :)  That I am. I've masturbated to quite a few women in my time, and I bet you hate them all. :)  &gt;Slow work day - plus I do enjoy picking apart fools like you who jump in to full attack mode without even bothering to read the source article. That and the fact that on the few times we've engaged before, you've been equally moronic. You really should stop embarrassing yourself like this...  This is another bizarre tactic of yours, when you start to realise you've got nothing to substantiate your argument with, you'll resort to telling your opponent they've not read the source. But I have. I've explicitly mentioned about half a dozen things that are *from* the source, so even you must know that this is desperation on your end.  And the last time we ""engaged,"" I dismissed you the moment you mentioned a flat tax rate being ""fair."" Yet you continued to drag it on because you can't handle not being acknowledged, or not having the last word. Either way, embarrassing.  &gt;Thanks, I believe you believe it. I also believe that you highlight the kind of mentality of those who just see red at the mere mention of UKIP.  Only one of us is seen as economically clueless, bigoted, xenophobic little Englanders though. :)  &gt;You've jumped in without reading the source, made heavy use of ad hominem fallacies, added nothing of substance and, ultimately, failed to even make a coherent point.   &gt;Personally I'm willing to believe there may be a logical argument as to why I'm wrong, but you certainly havent made it.

As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  ¬© Max Ehrmann 1927 ",¬©

I read the reportage of the internal investigation, which is more than you have. If the alleged victim wishes to make a police complaint then she should do so.   Frankly, your claims of UKIP 'letting the lads sexually assault her' is a false accusation with literally no basis in fact.  &gt; That I am.

You asked me why I was responding and so I told you. No context is safe around you, eh Mr Twisty?

On the contrary, I am happy to admit when I am wrong, and have done so many times, but only when I'm wrong. Since this discussion is simply you attacking me for not agreeing with you, then I'll be holding my position until you either get bored or flip out - just like last time.  &gt; Only one of us is seen as economically clueless, bigoted, xenophobic little Englanders though. :)  You're wasting your breath because I honestly don't give a flying fuck what you think.

t5_2rmwz,AptMoniker,1374771203,"So wait. They are making you do the pagination?   If you need to paginate the file FOR them, then that's weird, but it's not hard.  What you do is just design your cd sleeve like normal‚Äîinstead of spreads, design it with facing pages at 4.75x4.75 and standard bleed.   It'll look like this:           [1]     [2][3]     [4][5]     [6][7]     [8][9]     [10]   Basically, what you're going to do is print a Postscript File and then convert it to a press ready PDF. You're letting the software paginate for you! Once you're done with your design, you go to File &gt; Print Booklet. Print Preset is: [Custom], I am assuming that it's a standard saddle stitch so select that option. Turn off Creep and Space between pages. You don't need that shit with such a small booklet. Turn off margins and print blank printer pages.   NOW, at the bottom of that dialog window, go to Print Settings. Select PostScript¬Æ File in that Printer dropdown menu in that window. In the PPD dropdown directly below Printer, select Adobe PDF 9.0.   You should be able to navigate a lot from here as most of the settings are common sense. Once you save you PostScript file (file extention is .ps) you can open it with Acrobat Distiller, select the pdf settings (I would go with PDF/X:1a:2001) and you should be good to go with your now paginated print-ready pdf!   Here's the thing, if all else fails, design it like normal and export EPS files. They'll be huge, my experience with cd packaging printers is that they will take over and do a bit of the work. In other words, you can take the opportunity to learn how to export paginated pdfs, or say fuck it, and let the printhouse producers do it like they should. Maybe you give them a call, too!   Good luck!   Source: Former Print Producer and Professor. ",¬Æ

You can't be there to stop them 24/7. I have a wayward brother, too, and when we lived together I did everything I could to change the direction he was heading. I told our parents, I broke/threw out some of his illegal stuff, I even begged. My brother is too arrogant to listen. It was too painful to watch him fuck up over and over again despite my begging, so I had to give up and focus on my own life. A therapist told me later that addicts usually stop maturing at the time they start using--well, he started using at 13, so that's what he acts like.

t5_2tx47,bridget1989,1374783248,"Hello! First I wanted to congratulate you on your new job. I have a second interview tomorrow, so it would be great if you could send some of that good job karma my way! Being unemployed sucks!  Here's my entry:  4) My most wanted item on my wish list is the complete disc set of Harry Potter. I don't *need* it as much as the other entries (mostly dog stuff), but I would like it because my parents are always bugging me to bring my own DVDs home so they can watch HP. So while the glow-in-the-dark collar is something I need a little more (for my dog on night time walks; she has a runaway habit and I get scared that I'll lose her or that we'll get hit by a car), I really want but don't need all of the HP movies so I can give them to my HP-loving mom and pop. ‚ô•  6) My dream job would be professional volunteer. If someone could pay my cost of living for the rest of my life, I would commit myself to volunteering with ANY and EVERY organization that exists and needs my help. The problem is that the jobs that make you feel good and use your whole heart don't pay anything. And the jobs that pay enough to live on and save some for your future are SOUL SUCKING. I need to find a balance, which is why I'm looking for work within nonprofit agencies. ‚ô•  P.S. I'm new here and just posted my intro today!

Though it's still showing contentment, it's not quite the same as a cat! If you place your hand on the side of their face while you hear the noise, you can feel a small vibration from the molars. This is because it's actually grinding the top and bottom of its teeth!   But be careful! If the noise sounds more like loud chattering or 'crunching' the rabbit may actually be in pain! To help you spot the difference, you can also tell from the body language. A rabbit 'teeth grinding' from pain will usually sit in a hunched up position with its ears pressed against its body.

However, what it was lacking in organization, it made up for in price and quality. I know that when I go to Thailand, they bring the girls out in a line and you select who you want to please you. Here it's more of a daycare of a musty smelling warehouse strewn with old mattresses and used condoms. Definitely more sanitary than India, that is for sure. I had to walk around and find a child who was not ""occupied"" and then bring her to a table of men playing cards and smoking cigars. When you go, make sure to hold onto their wrists tight as they try to break free and catching them in the warehouse again can be time consuming. You ask the gentlemen how much 30 minutes with her will be and then pay your price, which promptly will be put on the table as betting stakes. The quality is up there however. You can tell by the lack of stubble that may appear in India when they try to pass off girls as younger than they really are.

I waaaaay overthought a birthday dinner I was having last year, wanted a place that had good food, fair prices, some outdoor element and not a ton of waiting on a Friday night. After scouring Yelp more than was healthy, Forza was a candidate. Called them up and the owner was super nice. Thanked me for considering them, told me a bit about the restaurant and their supposed specialities, even offered me a cake of some sort (think it was a cheesecake) as a birthday dessert on the house. I decided to go with Forza based on his nice attitude and booked a reservation.  Big mistake. I should have known that there was a reason they didn't have crowds on a Friday night in the summer when they have a patio. Walked in and the reservation wasn't made, first bad sign, although it didn't really matter b/c the place was deserted. Took them forever to serve us. Food wasn't as pathetic as what I hope becomes known as the Forza Pizza‚Ñ¢ here on Reddit, but it certainly wasn't good. No free cheesecake either, although at that point I just wanted to get my friends out of there as quick as possible and hoped they'd forget it ever happened. That didn't occur, although luckily it's become more of a running joke...  All the negatives surrounding his business actually don't surprise me at all. The guy means well and wants to run a successful business, but he's not focused. Not focused enough to make sure that the pizzas don't go out without one of four simple ingredients, not focused enough to make a reservation or remember a desert request, not focused enough to run a quality italian restaurant instead of trying to be a Lincoln nightclub, not focused enough to ensure his employees care as much as he does.  **tl;dr: Don't be fooled by the nice owner, it doesn't translate into a good place to eat** ",‚Ñ¢

RESPECTS!!!!***  &gt; I am going to get her to a vet so we can properly assess her injuries because it's obvious she has more going on.   At this point I'm still thinking she's can be rescued and brought back... but those lets have to get set in some manner.  Even with popcicle sticks,  blunted toothpicks and soda straws They've got to be somehow set and stabilized. Good luck trying to get a female veiled to understand that.... it might be more than a two person job.   Maybe the vet can dope her up a bit to get it all done.  Recovery:  That means getting her out of the cage and putting her into a tub where she can get the light and not risk falling.  I'd make a temp tub for her and place her in it. (side bar)  Using a level surface will put less pressure on the arms and legs. she can still have the leafy covering to give the impression of hiding and not being exposed.  It's going to be a really special pet if you can do all of this for her. *(She'll owe ya!)*   &gt;assuming she can be helped by being fed a liquid diet I have no problems doing so.   That's excellent news! I've used mashed up crickets, supplement powder and something like a liquid meal like [Ensure¬Æ Nutrition Shake vanilla flavor](http://www.drugstore.com/ensure-nutrition-shake-8-fl-oz-vanilla/qxp11948)  I'm sure that you can find them cheaper somewhere. All of this has gone into a [curved syringe](http://www.kvsupply.com/disposable-syringe-with-tapered-curved-tip-12-cc/&amp;refcode=Froogle&amp;CAWELAID=983667070&amp;cagpspn=pla&amp;gclid=CMGd_9XIzLgCFQNyQgodCx4Avw) and slowly dripped onto their nose or a bit put between their lips until they get the idea that it's edible.   I've fed this to a recovering animal that had surgery (swallowed his tongue) trust me, that was a difficult coaxing ... to get it to start letting me feed him.  Thanks for the redditgold offer... but please apply the $30 to the vet x-rays you'll need to have taken.  I'm rootin for her and I want to see her all healed up!

In fact, the only reason you could possibly be this butthurt if you are married, or desire marriage and are offended I insulted the intelligence and character of men who would, and if that's the case, insulting me instead of bringing up a counter-argument is pretty pathetic.   &gt;But luckily, this being Reddit, I don't need to ask you for permission to call you out on your BS.

At this point leveling a character would be just a chore to tweak some skill points while not being very fun. I don't like the idea of making a small mistake and your char instantly becomes inefficient. I like the rune system but I definitely see the positive sides of skill trees, because you'd have more ways to create a unique character.   Nephalem Cube &amp; Cauldron: I'd love to see those two being readded in the expansion (or before, haha..). I'm seriously fed up with always one character in town in a public game because of ""gotta sell"". IDing items also simply adds nothing more fun to the game.

Unfortunately this was my experience at the local child prostitution ring. A local offered to bring me to this ring, and I was expecting organization on the same scale as in Thailand and India. However, what it was lacking in organization, it made up for in price and quality. I know that when I go to Thailand, they bring the girls out in a line and you select who you want to please you. Here it's more of a daycare of a musty smelling warehouse strewn with old mattresses and used condoms. Definitely more sanitary than India, that is for sure. I had to walk around and find a child who was not ""occupied"" and then bring her to a table of men playing cards and smoking cigars. When you go, make sure to hold onto their wrists tight as they try to break free and catching them in the warehouse again can be time consuming. You ask the gentlemen how much 30 minutes with her will be and then pay your price, which promptly will be put on the table as betting stakes. The quality is up there however. You can tell by the lack of stubble that may appear in India when they try to pass off girls as younger than they really are. Overall, I gave this 3 out of 5 stars because the facility could use more organization and control. If you want the most bang for your buck however, this place can't be beat.

For Canada to make claim to the north we have to have people living there...who say they are Canadian. There is not a lot of economic insensitive to be up north so we subsidies the seal hunt. The added bonus is that killing off some of the seals helps repair some of the damaged fisheries. Seals are the rats of the sea, cute rats I'll grant you, but rats.

Unlike most of the other items in the bill of rights, the second amendment *is a money-maker*, which means you've already got for-profit firearm-and-gun-related companies involved in funneling money to advocacy groups and doing their own lobbying. In contrast, who makes money off of fourth-amendment protections?  3. This means the ACLU is in opposition to profitable interests which are making money selling sensors and drones and SWAT gear etc. to the overreaching drug-war/security-state... Often the *same* companies who support the NRA. This means what you're asking for isn't merely an extra task, but a somewhat contradictory one.

t5_2s30g,The_Mermaid,1374879536," &gt;Because their entire society is build on social conditioning. You cannot have a society in which people have darwinian freedom, but can't do this one thing, or that one thing. It doesn't work.   What's to say that patriarchal societies aren't built on social conditioning? Is there an actual, biological, evolutionary reason why men should be dominant and women be submissive?  &gt;It's not a belief, it's a fact.   Can you back this ""fact"" up in some way? And how do you explain women who are very dominant, and men who are very submissive?   &gt;I didn't say they were.   Just making sure... Some people try to blame the entire gender inequality issue on Muslim countries.   &gt;America, Canada, Australia and particularly Britain.  I live in the US. Women here have equal rights for the most part, a big legal issue in the US is a woman's right to obtain an abortion. Socially, there are so many double standards. Women are expected to take their husband's name. Men are called ""heads of households."" Women are objectified in the media.  And probably the worst, if women are raped, many people try to blame her clothing, her behaviour, her location, or if she was drinking, they blame it on that.    &gt;Name 5.   See above, I don't know if I listed 5. Some others are that women are expected to be more sexually ""pure"" than men. Women are given greater pressure to get married than men. If women don't want kids, they are considered ""unmotherly"". Many people expect married women to be submissive to their husbands.   &gt;The only way any rational person could possibly believe that men have more social privilege than women is if they never leave their house, don't watch the news, or spend their day reading feminist blogs. No creature who's socio-sexual value and maintainance of life is determined by how pretty they look on a barstool is at a detriment in life over someone who is presumed socially valueless until he proves he is socially valuable.    I have a lot going for me, not just my appearance. I'm intelligent and creative, a hard worker, and easy to get along with. Why do some men think women are just ""pretty things on a barstool""?  &gt;Alpha males don't control your life or push you around. That's beta male behavior. If anything, an alpha would do the opposite; not be bothered too much with you until you prove your worth his attention.   Interesting, I didn't know that. I don't date pushy or controlling guys, that's not my thing.   &gt;http://www.returnofkings.com/category/masculinity  I hate that site üò° but thanks for the link, I'll check that out.",üò°

t5_2sc5r,TychoCelchuuu,1374880101,"Because I Care‚Ñ¢, I went and found the post in /r/science that started this whole mess. /u/Carlo_The_Mango said:  &gt; /r/philosophy is where you should ask that. Science is about observations, not wishful thinking.  Uh oh! It looks like the scientist is saying ""why do people kill each other"" is a job for philosophy! So then you come here and you're mad that we can't answer your question. Let's look closer, though. Check out [the conversation starting from this earlier point](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1j1juq/what_happens_to_individual_members_of_colony/cbahoq4).  First /u/BitGambit says ""living things are assholes."" Then you reply ""but you don't want to know why? You accept that as an answer?"" And *that* is when Carlo refers you to /r/philosophy.  The reason you were referred here is because BitGambit said living things are *assholes*. To answer the question ""why are people assholes"" we need to answer two things: number one, **what is an asshole?** Number two, **why are people assholes?**  Science can answer question #2 (well, sort of - psychology can try). But notice that you *can't* answer question #2 until you answer question #1.  Question #1 (""what is an asshole?"") is a question for philosophy. **Asshole** is an *evaluative* term: it implies that something is *bad*. Philosophy tells us what is good and bad. So, yes, you need to come to philosophy for part of your question, but only if you're confused about whether killing someone makes you an asshole. If you accept that it does, then philosophy's job is done, and now we turn to science to tell us *why* people kill each other.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qlzx,Grey17isMissing,1374880815,"&gt;When the LIKE pattern starts with a known prefix‚Äîfor example, col LIKE 'ABC%'‚Äî SQL Server can potentially efficiently use an index on the filtered column; in other words, SQL Server can rely on index ordering. When the pattern starts with a wildcard‚Äîfor example, col LIKE '%ABC%'‚ÄîSQL Server cannot rely on index ordering anymore. Also, when looking for a string that starts with a known prefix (say, ABC) make sure you use the LIKE predicate, as in col LIKE 'ABC%', because this form is considered a search argument. Recall that applying manipulation to the filtered column prevents the predicate from being a search argument. For example, the form LEFT(col, 3) = 'ABC' isn‚Äôt a search argument and will prevent SQL Server from being able to use an index efficiently.      Querying Microsoft¬Æ SQL Server¬Æ 2012 --Ben-Gan      The way I understand it then, is what using the like predicate means SQL will not reliably utilize existing Indexes.

t5_2w2s8,Buffalo__Buffalo,1374898360,"&gt;So, I think you and I are just disagreeing on definitions. To me, ""empowerment"" and ""eradication of exploitation"" are the same thing.  I know where you are coming from (and I admit that I did bait the discussion to go to this direction) but this is a problematic idea that you have about empowerment and the eradication of exploitation. Let me explain:  Our society is constructed in a specific way. If you are a traditional feminist, you would say that it is patriarchal - if not, then you can choose your power structure of choice. Regardless, the problem with empowerment is not the empowerment in itself (thought that would be a huge exploration alone) but the fact that just about every society I can think of is structured to exploit women.)  If we increase empowerment (undefined, I know, but stick with me here) who will stands to benefit most from the empowerment? The women who are fighting for equality, or the reactionary women who choose to perpetuate the exploitation and opt-in to the patriarchal society itself? Consider Margaret Thatcher, for example. A strong, powerful woman who essentially sold her gender out by her politics, through the political system. You can bet that if she had been more liberal she would not have been allowed to rise through the ranks.  Now, as a hypothetical, if we raise the empowerment equally amongst women in a developing country that is strongly patriarchal - what happens? The face of the patriarchy changes, perhaps it even becomes something closer to a hegemony with mandatory female positions in government etc., but then we have simply reinforced the system itself - perhaps it is even more resilient than it was before because women have a belief that they are being represented (this would be an application of Marxian Possibility Of Upward Mobility.)  But let's depart from this example and look to microloans. Underlying this, again, is that same dogmatic liberal belief that progress is a linear process and that we have arrived (or we are close enough - after all, we are *modern* aren't we?)  Microloans are great for creating a petty-bourgeois or a middle-class. They do not provide assistance to people who are not financially secure and are already demonstrating an ability to show profits. Microloans create a merchant class, a class of people who in fact become the apparatus of exploitation of the poor - the woman who has opened a clothing store in Bangladesh from a microloan buys a phone which is made from conflict ColTan from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, assembled in a Chinese sweatshop by a person who only earns enough to eat and have a roof over their head (who, incidentally, has also signed a contract that they will not take their own life), which is then shipped at a net profit through creative finance either by a company or by an aid organization, using freighters which are pushing to open up shipping lanes right through the center of the Great Barrier Reef which will endanger this already beleaguered ecosystem, and finally they get their phone and charge it by using fossil fuels which add yet-more carbon to the atmosphere which will further threaten the just-barely-subsistence farmers who are struggling with salinity and flooding problems on their land near the Bay of Bengal.  The woman who owns this shop eventually becomes successful enough to hire a worker for her - incidentally one of the women who had to flee the downstream farming area because the recent flood wiped out her familys crops. Now this woman must sew 10 hours a day, 6 days a week to provide food for her family. But the food doesn't provide itself - and when we are talking about the typical Bangladeshi family, we all know who is going to do the cooking. And the child-raising. And now the bread-winning. (Incidentally, this is often the reason why women in the west are hostile towards feminism - that before a womans place was in the kitchen, etc. etc. but *now* their place is in the boardroom, in the kindergarten, in the kitchen, in the laundry, in the college and every other goddamned place - and *they* are still the ones doing all the unpaid labor. And half of the paid work. But they don't get any of the higher positions because they have child-care responsibilities, and then there were those few years when they were pregnant and raising the two little ones which threw a spanner in the career trajectory from which they will never recover because now men have occupied all of the top positions in the companies.)  But the best part of this? This woman is now being exploited. Her labor is being purchased wholesale and sold retail, and the owner of the shop is the one making the profit.  This is the underlying dogmatic belief - that the market is a force for good, or at least a neutral force, and when harnessed it will become a force for liberation and empowerment. Not so. At least, not for all women - just some who are in a good position to capitalize on the circumstances and become exploiters and not exploited.  This idea goes right back to the heart of the American Dream‚Ñ¢. The US developed a narrative of progress and liberation which became inextricably bound up in the idea that becoming a middle-class business owner is freedom - when actually it is the  halfway point between what was then known as the robber-barons and the post-slave subsistence workforce.  The real problem is that our system needs a bottom rung to exploit, not that women are on the bottom rung (though, these two problems are currently synonymous.) You can change the arrangement on the ladder, but the ladder itself remains unchanged.  On top of this, these microloans are reproducing a carbon-copy of the current financial systems we have which are clearly dysfunctional. We aren't exporting spices or linen these days, nor are we exporting noble western values, but now we are exporting a market - and why? Because by doing so we have fresh blood for exploitation, both the newfound wage-laborer but also in countries to which we can leverage (because we have more power than them - see above argument regarding increasing empowerment) so that the crazy-inflated US dollar, and the impacts of it, can be thwarted for a little while longer. Of course when the market goes belly-up, it's those petty-bourgeois and the exploited workers in the poorer countries that will get screwed over the most. But hey, it's progress right?  I see the idea of exporting 'empowerment' as a slightly more sophisticated facet that shares the same values that hold the idea of ""the vote"" as the pinnacle of democracy.

t5_2s30g,AFormidableContender,1374900438,"&gt;What's to say that patriarchal societies aren't built on social conditioning? Is there an actual, biological, evolutionary reason why men should be dominant and women be submissive?  Because testosterone. And men are stronger...I mean if you don't agree that Men are naturally far more dominant than women, this conversation isn't going to get far.   &gt;Can you back this ""fact"" up in some way? And how do you explain women who are very dominant, and men who are very submissive?  http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mit.edu%2Fjoha%2Fwww%2Fpublications_files%2FEisenegger_Haushofer_Fehr_TiCS_2011.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIbZw0_hmG_5qMYp8yCfs6j_U3kw  Anyone can adopt any quality If they feel they need it. Successful, dominant women have to behave as men because men don't respect women who behave as women as figures of authority. Again, domesticating a single lion doesn't mean all and any lion can be domesticated indefinitely.   &gt;See above, I don't know if I listed 5. Some others are that women are expected to be more sexually ""pure"" than men. Women are given greater pressure to get married than men. If women don't want kids, they are considered ""unmotherly"". Many people expect married women to be submissive to their husbands.  Nothing you listed is a real double standard or social expectation. You basically listed a bunch of stereotypes of American culture from 1950...   &gt;I have a lot going for me, not just my appearance. I'm intelligent and creative, a hard worker, and easy to get along with. Why do some men think women are just ""pretty things on a barstool""?

t5_2qhnf,itscalledska,1374900830," Davidson has commented on these noting that datura was ‚Äúemployed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed ""passion seeds"" (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like hallucinations.‚Äù Numerous references were found to the use of datura in ointments (Stablein 1976, Baker 2004, Hartzell 1991, Davidson 2002). Homa-rituals making use of datura were found to be quite COMMON &lt;my emphasis&gt; (Gray 2007, Siklos 1993 &amp; 1996, Tsuda 1974, Fremantle 1971, Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956, Hartzell 19 91, Davidson 2002).  Also found was a detailed meditation on the drug-induced visionary experience as method to gain insight into the nature of reality (Stearns 2006). ""  'The Use of Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition: a brief summary of preliminary findings together with a partial bibliography. ¬© 2007 R.C. Parker (updated 2008)'  To further iterate then, it is not absolutely shunned by the Vajrayana paths of transformation, or the Dzogchen paths of spontaneous liberation and direct seeing. Therefor if OP wishes to follow his karma, he is not committing an error in the face of Buddhism.   Moreover, it is clear by my prior response to you (stumbled across such things while compiling works on Yangthik etc, rather serendipitously) that an authentic experience or introduction to the Dharma can be had with substances and even while intoxicated (to clarify it also means an enhancing of the dharmic experience beyond mere introduction per the statements of the two Rinpoches), and further that being a Buddhist or not is besides the point of the authentic dharmic experience (per the statements of the Rinpoche). This information is published publicly with no attempt to block to those without teacher, further there is no emphasis of a teacher required.  As the Rinpoche said, even having the drug interest and drug experience that leads to the Dharma is a serious fruit of the past karma and a result of one's inner Guru. To the degree of even giving half a prostration to the drug that induces such states. So I completely disagree that this isn't relevant to the OP, as none of the requirements you mention (having a Guru, with or without samaya vows with, tell you otherwise) were mentioned by the Rinpoche's at all. The fact is, this directly contradicts several of your absolutist claims.   Having said this, to clear up. I also think when the OP was using the terminology ego-death (based off the little explanation given) he was referring to the dimension of the base-of-all and not the actual (rigpa) or non-actual clear light.",¬©

t5_2qh63,darthhayek,1374926562,"&gt;Sure, and without knowing who initially escalated the situation, prioritizing one self-defense claim over the other person's seems pretty selective and arbitrary. Martin may have (given one possible course of events) felt threatened by a man with a gun approaching him in the dark, or even been threatened, yet oddly the usual hair-trigger rationale for manslaughter in case of threat isn't being applied here on Martin's behalf.  Trayvon Martin wasn't on trial. If things had gone different, maybe he would have had a claim to self-defense too. If you think George Zimmerman should have to prove his self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt then you have an issue with Innocent Before Proven Guilty. The important thing is that George Zimmerman's version of events fit the evidence and witness testimony, and there was never any evidence to convict let alone charge him with a crime, which is why the police let him go after questioning and why Angela Corey never called a grand jury.  &gt;Do we assume that one party's actions were self-defense and the other's aggression because they had a gun and are therefore the good guy  I don't think either one of them has to be the bad guy. Even Zimmerman's lawyers said it's a tragedy that a 17-year-old was killed.  &gt;If this situation were reversed (a black man was talking on the phone about approaching somebody, was told not to, then after a series of events he ended up with some injuries and the other man was dead), we wouldn't comb through the dead white guy's house looking for heavy metal posters or pot or mine the guy's Facebook looking for violent or sexual posts to prove that he was clearly an animal and needed to be put down. We'd be calling for everybody to carry a weapon so the same thing didn't happen to them.  The same thing did happen [in New York](http://www.mpnnow.com/news/x967378480/Roderick-Scott-I-had-to-protect-myself), but you already knew that.   Both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had their reputations ruined, but that's the media's fault for sensationalizing it. Nobody would have cared enough about a black teen killed in Florida to do that stuff if the media didn't hype it up as this month's Trial of the Century‚Ñ¢.",‚Ñ¢

I used to race triathlon competitively, and you get really creative with your drinks like this :) You're drinking so much water, you run the risk of dehydrating yourself. And stuff like gatorade is super sweet and usually has too much sugar and salt (compared to other mineral)... so I ended up making my own gatorade with maltodextrin (carb, alternative to sugar, not sweet, but super high glycemic index) and a couple of nuun tablets which also gave it some flavor.  Some of those (especially Nuun) can be really expensive though. They sponsored me so I got free boxes of the stuff, dunno if I'd buy it on my own if I were drinking it a lot. If you drink a lot of water and exercise, I'd recommend getting a tub of the hammer endurolytes (or something in a big tub) and just putting a spoon of it in a water bottle each day. And you can put some in a zip log bag or something and take it to work, put it in your gym bag, whatever.  And for what it's worth, I'm a huge fan of celtic sea salt (just as a salt - it's insanely good, and super rich in natural minerals), and just saw that they make an electrolyte mix, too! I might pick up some now that I know about it :) [Here it is](http://www.selinanaturally.com/electrolyte-powder/).  Here are the ingredients, looks pretty solid:  &gt; Detailed Ingredients &amp; origin of minerals: CSS¬Æ, Florida dipotassium phosphate, Great Salt lake potassium sulfate, Gulf of Mexico magnesium sulfate, trace minerals from Texas and Arkansas, Citric Acid.",¬Æ

t5_2razk,Ashoat,1374947757,"I'm a recent CSE graduate, and overall I agree with your points, but a couple of things to say:  1. The department says that the focus in keeping student/professor counts low is quality of education. It makes sense in that each student who gets in gets a better education, but each student who doesn't get in doesn't get an education at all. Is that really worth it? It ends up coming off as quite elitist, especially when compared with other departments at UW that accept larger class sizes.  2. The department has another motivation to keep student/professor counts low: it wants to focus on its research mission as well as its education mission. Professors that have to spent most of their time teaching don't have time to work on research work. The department has a couple paid Lecturer roles, but overall it seems that CSE leans further towards research than other UW departments.  3. To be fair to the student in question... the admission system is certainly imperfect. I've repeatedly heard the complaint that the system cares too much about grades and too little about passion. Does it really matter what grade the student got in MATH 126 if they've written a working game engine? There are certainly other sides to this. If the department biases towards students who already know how to program, it's likely not doing as much novel teaching, and furthermore probably biases against underrepresented groups.  I think that the popular discontent over the department's acceptance policies is a Hard Problem‚Ñ¢ - it reflects goals of the CSE department that are often not shared by the student body. That does not mean they are bad goals, or even goals that do not serve the public; but it does lead to a lot of discontent.",‚Ñ¢

In February, 1966, two lieutenants of Company ""C,"" Second Battalion, 35th Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, wrote The United States Playing Card Company and requested decks containing nothing but the Bicycle¬Æ Ace of Spades. The cards were useful in psychological warfare. The Viet Cong were very superstitious and highly frightened by this Ace. The French previously had occupied Indo-China, and in French fortunetelling with cards, the Spades predicted death and suffering. The Viet Cong even regarded lady liberty as a goddess of death. USPC shipped thousands of the requested decks gratis to our troops in Vietnam. These decks were housed in plain white tuckcases, inscribed ""Bicycle¬Æ Secret Weapon."" The cards were deliberately scattered in the jungle and in hostile villages during raids. The very sight of the Bicycle¬Æ Ace card was said to cause many Viet Cong to flee. ",¬Æ

When I purchased the iPhone 4S in October 2011, I made up my mind that I would not jailbreak it for any reason whatsoever, and believe me, it was the best decision I made in this regard. I kept it for 17 months before I have it up for the iPhone 5, and like the 4S before it, it is not and will not be jailbroken.

t5_2rfz5,Jame5G,1374972076,"One Piece makes you feel like one of the crew. It draws you in; makes the reader/viewer care about what happens to the characters central to its story. Its presented in a way that makes the audience want to become personally involved. Watching a series, say for instance Neon Genesis Evangelion, the ""hook"" manifests itself 12-15 episodes in out of 26 total, mileage may vary. In One Piece you're pulled in from the very beginning because everyone can identify with *the Dream*, this one overarching, often unfulfilled ambition they always remember having.  One Piece and Naruto are similar in that they each have the backdrop of their protagonists' respective ambitions setting up everything that follows. Both pay homage to archetypical, trendsetting Dragonball Z and enduring shounen anime traditions, details of which you'll likely recognize straight away. Apart from that the similarities fade: instead of mystic shadow warriors you have seafaring outlaws wanted by the law. Not every major character is a pirate or is otherwise tied to piracy in some fundamental way. Finally I personally think the biggest difference is what I like to call the Popeye‚Ñ¢ Factor. One Piece is just stylistically *weirder* than Naruto, which is meant to be taken in a very good way. (And no, Popeye never actually makes an appearance in One Piece, I just feel he'd more easily blend in as compared to Naruto. Make of that what you will. :3) ",‚Ñ¢

Luckily, no one is talking about doing nothing but applying strategies read online. Glad we agree ‚ô•  &gt;I would also argue that there is no such thing as the ""quality"" of a human being in this context, only fitness for another. My SO is perfect for me and that's all that matters.  Someone being your type is not analagous with people having or not having value. I am not even remotely attracted to Angelina Jolie, but I am fully aware that she's an attractive, high quality person.   A terrible argument born of cognitive dissonance dude...  &gt;Lastly, I think it's hilarious that you equate seduction ability with masculinity.  I think it's hilarious that your interpretation of anything I said is equating seduction ability with masculinity. A high skill in seduction is consequence of living a good, masculinely validated life-style. People who don't currently have that, have to work backwards. These are not the same thing and have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.   &gt; If that's really what you base your masculinity/self worth on it's kind of pathetic  I didn't ask for your opinion, though, if I did, I doubt you'd have much of value to say judging by your level of ignorance on the topic at hand.

t5_2qqjc,Arkansas_Times,1375023031,"Though 2009 wasn't that long ago, back then it was a lot harder to get a story to move from local to national, especially when it involved someone like Tracy Ingle. There's no CNN/Fox/MSNBC-style ""hook"" to a story like this, or to Ingle, or in most cases of police overreach. [Here, for example, is another story I've been working on](http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2013/07/09/aclu-files-suit-over-police-brutality-case-in-dover) where a mother and son were walking their dog in a little town, and a police officer became suspicious of them after the boy waved at him. Officer stopped, called for backup, and before it was all over the mother and son were both beaten and tased to the point the mother urinated on herself. Both were eventually charged with several misdemeanors, including the mother being charged with criminal mischief because, the ACLU-Arkansas director said, the woman's body broke the antenna of a police cruiser while she was being repeatedly slammed into the trunk lid. ACLU has filed suit in Federal court, calling the case ""egregious."" Will it ever make CNN? Probably not.  Stories like Ingle's and the Dover case are what make social media and Reddit so valuable. This thread is an instance where a completely forgotten, local case is now on the radar of a couple million people, and interest by a couple million people is enough to push a story onto CNN. That's how a local story goes national. The gates that used to contain the information are down, folks, for the good or ill of reporters like me. The flip side of that coin is: whether you or I like it or not, public interest often drives what CNN initially reports. Once it's on there, it can become a perpetual motion machine, but the initial national interest these days often starts on Reddit and Facebook.   I tell people that the Internet has configured itself into this orbiting ion cannon. Somebody in power royally screws up, and up there in outer space, a robot voice says ""targeting,"" and the crystal tip of The Orbiting Ion Cannon of Social Media‚Ñ¢ begins to glow blue. I realized this while working [on stories about Clint McCance,](http://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/facebook-clint-mccance-and-a-teaching-moment-about-hate/Content?oid=1573608) the school board member from here in Arkansas who got on Facebook and said the only way he'd wear purple is if all gays would commit suicide, and he was glad about AIDS, and would disown his kids if they came out as gay, and other vile stuff.    That was the first time I saw it: a local case that would normally have made a ripple, but instead turned into a tidal wave because of social media and the internet. For a reporter used to watching stories tumble down the memory hole, it was a lovely thing to witness. Here, for example, is [George Takei's take on the story.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UACK93xF-FE) As little as five years ago, McCance would have been forgotten in a week, his words never having left the borders of Arkansas or even the town where he lived. As is, the national outcry was overwhelming, and McCance resigned.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhyq,scrumptiouscakes,1375035391,"A lot of indie pop has quite interesting instrumentation. Architecture in Helsinki are particularly fun. I listed a few other interesting people in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1g00za/in_your_opinion_who_do_you_think_are_the_best/cafwhly).  As for the piano example in your original link, I'll just say that the piano is a percussion instrument, after all. There are quite a lot of classical pieces which use it in that way, either as an additional orchestral colour, or by itself - Stravinsky, Bartok, Antheil, etc.   Pop music often uses these instruments in a fairly simple way, but I think there are a number of different reasons for this, which vary from case to case. Sometimes it's deliberate, because pop singles by their very nature have to be fairly simple and direct ([and that is not meant as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk2xaeXnxlM) [a criticism by any means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0YifXhm-Zc)) or because someone is consciously using these instruments in an unusual way from a classical point of view, sometimes it's just because the songwriter or arranger isn't classically trained and isn't necessarily aware of the potential or limitations of the instruments they're using (again, not a criticism, it's just different), and sometimes it's lack of imagination - Difficult Second Album Syndrome‚Ñ¢ sometimes leads people to bring in an orchestra and/or a gospel choir to cover up for inadequacy in other departments. Even people who've listened to a lot of the sort of stuff that I linked to in my last post might not necessarily appreciate Ravel's orchestration right away (and I speak from personal experience on that count), so if pop music's style of instrumentation is all you've ever known, then you aren't necessarily going to be exploring beyond it, especially if you're only using those instruments for one track on one album.",‚Ñ¢

It seemed too bullshitted and try hard to me, so going into this, I could not say I was expecting much  I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by this tape, perhaps in the same manner that if you are expecting reruns for dinner even hamburger helper can be delicious. I won't front, the best thing going on for this album is Yung Gud. I can see him going further than Yung Lean; his beats work excellently for the project, and the instrumentals to them would be fire. In a way, at some point to me, Yung Lean just became percussion to me, I no longer listened for meaning, instead I just allowed his voice to add to the beat. After the first two tracks were  not sounding too good, I further adopted this mentality, and my impression really brightened up. I won't say that I'm a fan, but I'll definitely peep whatever he has next.  Score: 7/10  Tracks to Listen To:  Gatorade  Princess Daisy  Lemonade  Emails",‚ôã

t5_2spwr,Kichigai,1375065133,"&gt; Why is it being the equivalent of a large Android phone a bad thing?  On the whole, nothing. But if it's just scaled up phone apps that don't take advantage of the greater amount of screen space at their disposal then I may as well keep using my phone. One less device to carry around that way.  &gt; they're light and you can carry them on the go. When you get home you can hook up a bluetooth/USB On the Go mouse and keyboard, connect it to a monitor through MHL, and use it as a desktop. You can use Kingsoft Office, Google Drive, CloudOn to edit Word/Excel/Powerpoint documents for free, and QuickOffice, DocsToGo, etc if you want to edit it with advanced features when offline.  But you can do all of that with an iPad and Windows tablets. Most of that you can even do in Windows RT. What are the killer apps on Android tablets? What sets it apart from its competition?  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to diminish Android as a tablet OS, I really want to like it, but the manufacturers are doing a poor job of selling them, so I thought I'd come to users and see what they do with it in The Real World‚Ñ¢.  &gt; And it isn't a bad thing at all.  It's not. It's not at all. But you could say the same thing about the iPad, but there is compelling software out there that people know about, and can easily discover before ever owning an iPad, that makes it a really useful machine. When it comes to Android, I'm drawing a blank. Neither Google, nor Samsung, nor Asus are doing a particularly good job showing me what I could do with this thing once I own it, essentially leaving me to throw down the money and figure it all out for myself. So that's why I'm asking: because I think the Android community can fill in this gap.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2rlua,SlappinFace,1375110988,One of the few (read: only) reasons why BF3 is better on console. It makes it so much easier to coordinate with team mates and it can be brilliantly entertaining. Maybe the reason why they don't allow mics in-game on PC BF is due to the typically higher player counts? Not only could this place more stress on the server but would also end up like that Teamspeak episode of Battlefield Friends üò≥,üò≥

Most library workers in my city have several contract jobs at different places before they land a permanent position.  I'm no exception.  Those of us who stick with it for a few years generally land decent jobs, though.      I have never once gotten a job when I wore a tie to the interview.  Part of this is my personality; I don't think people take me seriously when I'm trying to put on a Professional Face‚Ñ¢ that doesn't fit.  Part of it, though, is that I'm from a university town.  The smaller, less formal academic libraries are looking for a different type than the larger schools or the community colleges.  Similarly, although the local public libraries are part of the same system, the rural branches may be looking for a different skillset and outlook than those in urban areas.  If you can, visit the library.  Watch how the staff dress, how they speak to the patrons, and (most importantly) how they speak to each other.  It'll tell you a lot about where you are and what they're looking for.  Remember, they have to spend a lot of time with the person they hire.  You could be a big part of their lives.  Being the right fit for that group can be even more important than having perfect qualifications.  Good luck.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qil9,mderekt,1375133674,"Moons in EVE contain resources which can be mined by controlling a Player-Owned Starbase (POS) at that moon. These resources (commonly referred to as ""moon goo"") are rated by rarity in powers of two (R4,R8,R16,R32,R64) with the intent of rarer materials being more expensive.  However, prior to the recent Odyssey expansion, Technetium (""Tech""), a R32 product, was the bottleneck for the production of a number of Tech 2 ships. Bottlenecks like these can exist as the amount of moon goo produced is effectively limited by the number of moons containing that type of goo in EVE.  Recognizing this imbalance, a number of alliances spearheaded by Goonswarm Federation (GSF) formed OTEC (the **O**rganization of **T**echnetium **E**xporting **C**orporations), a cartel aiming to artificially limit the supply of Technetium further, thus increasing prices, as well as preventing any non-OTEC member from owning Technetium moons while also agreeing not to attack any Technetium moons owned by other member alliances.  OTEC led to a large amount of stagnation all over null-sec. Member alliances did not want to start wars fearing the retribution of others for disrupting their ridiculous amount of ISK. For example, Montolio, the at-the-time leader of TEST, formed the HoneyBadger Coalition (HBC) and called for war on the GSF-led CFC. However, his backers in Pandemic Legion (PL), controlling one of the largest supercapital fleets in EVE, abandoned him as they did not want to risk war.  Then, Odyssey happened. Moon goo was rebalanced, with Technetium no longer being a T2 bottleneck, and R64s once again being the most valuable goo. Large swathes of Technetium-rich CFC space in the north became near worthless in the blink of an eye. On the other hand, regions containing lots of R64 moons, such as Fountain, were suddenly made very attractive targets.  This, combined with the fact that the HBC had quite publicly splintered a few weeks prior to Odyssey after some Mistakes Were Made‚Ñ¢ by its head at the time, Sort Dragon, led to GSF CEO The Mittani, de facto leader of the CFC, declaring a full-on invasion of the Fountain region in a now-infamous [State of the Goonion speech](http://themittani.com/news/war-cfc-invades-fountain).  This is where war, and thus the realm of propaganda, begins. What can be discerned is that, after initial quick gains - assisted by metagame hijinks for example, Sort Dragon's Here Be Dragons corporation passed sovereignty of a few station systems in Fountain to GSF without a fight - the CFC struggled to maintain its early bridgehead as Pandemic Legion and the N3 coalition (Nulli Secunda, NC. and Nexus Fleet) joined the fray on the side of TEST, thus providing an enormously overwhelming supercapital advantage to the defenders. During the following counterattack, the CFC had to cede all but one of the systems received from There Be Dragons, but importantly managed to hold on to [4-EP12](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fountain/4-EP12#sov).  From there, the CFC, noticing the war would not be a quick one, switched up its strategy and relied on what is commonly referred to as ""blueballing"" - they would knock stations into reinforced mode stealthily, thus setting the stage for a fight, and then refuse to show up if TEST formed up. This deprived TEST pilots, who were promised a fight by leadership, of said fight, causing TEST numbers to slowly wane over a period of about one month.  Then, Z9PP happened ([CFC view](http://themittani.com/news/bomberfly-effect-battle-z9pp), [PL view](http://themittani.com/news/battle-z9pp-h-how-eve-nerds-make-fireworks)). In a monumental blunder, TEST seemed primed to lose an enormous amount of capital ships in one decisive battle - until the server came crashing down due to what we now know was a mistype by a CCP admin trying to improve performance. TEST ordered all capital pilots to not log back in, thus saving their ships. However, while ISK was saved, morale was not. The CFC smelled blood and organized a ""hellcamp"" - covering a large area in warp disruption bubbles - with the intent of catching and destroying any TEST capitals logging back into the game.  From here on we further delve into recent events where the happenings are still hazy. Apparently, TEST military directorate began timing their station timers into Australian TZ in an attempt to allow their ally NC.'s superior numbers in said TZ to discourage any CFC assaults. However, TEST's own participation numbers waned while PL lost interest. Combined with the russians of SOLAR attacking the N3 holdings in the east, drawing a large amount of supercapitals away, the TEST supercapital advantage was gone and the CFC, now staging from 4EP, which had ticked to sov3 (allowing placement of a Jump Bridge upgrade linking it directly to their previous staging system, as well as a Cynosural Jammer preventing capital ships from entering the system).  The CFC slowly started gaining systems, TEST numbers faltered, and their allies seemed disinterested in continuing to prop them up. In what seems like a last-ditch effort, TEST MilDir called for a all-hands-on-deck CTA for the shield timer of the 6VDT-H station.  [You know the rest](http://themittani.com/features/6vdt-cfc-battle-report). CFC got into system first, having previously obtained full moon coverage, thus depriving TEST forces of a safe point to form up in system. TEST, while outnumbered, bridged in multiple fleets and was forced to warp to station by a well-timed CFC bombing run. TEST command was headshotted off the field by the enormous amount of CFC forces, leaving TEST leaderless. After multiple hours of brawling, the CFC brought in a large fleet of Dreadnoughts in a show of force, upon which TEST fleets fled the field. With all moons in the system occupied by CFC starbases and all gates covered in warp disruption bubbles, the TEST fleets had nowhere to go. In a final attack, they charged into the CFC capital field, managing to down one CFC Naglfar-class dreadnought before dying.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2scq0,tidwell,1375142839,"I've been working on an API to dump json information for scrollstoolbox accounts - importing into a google doc from there is fairly straightforward.  I planned to have it released a while ago, but crafting threw a wrench in my roadmap.  There is a way to export it now, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops, probably more than you would be comfortable with if you are ""not programmy"", but for completeness:  Create a socket connection to scrollstoolbox on port 9000, send a user:login message over the socket containing {username: 'name', password: 'pw' } then merge the user:data response with the cards:list response (they are both arrays of objects with name properties to match them up).  I'm not quite sure how easy this is to reverse engineer as I use socket.io for communications, and theres probably some overhead there I'm not accounting for.  If a dev really wants to do this, your best bet is to look at the websocket frames in chrome dev tools and emulate what you see there.  If you want to modify the mod directly, you can probably just change the route that the mod sends the collection data to be a google-doc and then parse it from there, but I don't have much experience with that (you'd have to rebuild the mod and then add it to the proper location in summoner, and I think the resource paths for the mod *might* be looking at .dlls that aren't in the repo, but you can find those in some of kb's mods).  tl;dr  I'll have an API for scrollstoolbox soon‚Ñ¢ - in the meantime, there are ways, but they definitely require some programming.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r7yd,farmerje,1375148302,"Let's back up a second and figure out what this ""exercise"" is meant to teach you.  Or maybe a better way to think about it is this: what's the most you could get out of this exercise?  These are all just educated guesses, my opinion, etc. etc.  First, at the most superficial level, it's meant to teach you about string manipulation.  You have a set of string-related tools in your toolbox and this is a fine way to practice them.  This is fine and very boring.  There are also a million ways to do this that don't involve HTML.  Remove all numbers from a string.  Parse a CSV file.  Detect all SSN number inside a string.  Blah blah blah.  They're worth doing, but they'll get old pretty quick and you'll find yourself either inventing more powerful tools or looking for more powerful tools.  If you think this is the only thing you're meant to get out of the exercise you'll only get 5% of what you could. :)  Second, you have to get comfortable understanding a document format defined by a third-party &amp;mdash; HTML in this case.  How well do you know it, really?  Have you ever read the specifications?  Do you know *how* to read the specifications?  The ability to read technical documentation is valuable in general, not just in this case, so that's something worth learning.  For example, you'd learn that there are multiple versions of HTML.  Does your ""HTML scrubber"" work for all of them?  Does it need to?  How can you verify that it works for all of them?  Third, if you do read the HTML spec, you'll see that HTML is actually quite complicated.  For example, this is perfectly valid HTML:      &lt;a name=""&gt;""&gt;Hey, buddy!&lt;/a&gt;  Can your ""HTML scrubber"" handle that?  Does it need to?  That example isn't even that pathological, but it gives you a sense of where a na√Øve ""HTML scrubber"" might mess up.  What other pathological cases can you find?  Do you need to handle them all?  If you decide you want to handle them all, how do you know you've found ""all"" the pathological cases?  Suddenly the problem is much less cut-and-dry and becomes more conversational.  It's no longer this binary ""do I scrub HTML or not"" but instead is a question of scope: do I need to scrub all HTML?  Are there situations where it'd be really important that I do scrub it all?  Are there situations where I can ignore some pathological cases and perhaps make my code much simpler as a result?  You'll learn a lot by trying to scrub HTML using only those methods.  You should see how far you can take it.  Here's the twist ending, though: there's no way to properly scrub HTML in the way you describe that isn't tantamount to implementing a full-blown HTML parser.  HTML is not a nice, neat language.  There's a field in computer science called [Formal Language Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) which enables us to make precise statements about (1) what a language is and (2) how ""nice and neat"" it is.  There's a class of formal languages called ""regular languages"" which are precisely the languages that can be parsed, verified, or generated using regular expressions.  Bad news: HTML is not a regular language.  This means that even if you bring the full power of  regular expressions to bear on this problem *you will still not be able to do it*.  If you want to do well on this problem, think about it this way.  Talk about these issues, your understanding of them, and really grapple with the problems at hand.  Don't just check the checkbox, hand in the homework, and fool yourself into thinking you ""know how to scrub HTML"" or that you're ""really learning how to program.""  If you do this for every CS homework exercise you have for the rest of the year you'll come out the other end Knowing Your Shit‚Ñ¢. :)",‚Ñ¢

Euphoria (Euphoric) + Colors = **Eucoloric**  [Pic 1](http://imgur.com/LjYwjUl.jpg)  [Handwritten Name for proof?](http://i.imgur.com/vcmt3Pf.jpg)  I like to sketch, and collage, and write poems and stories.

This is not the exact recipe I use (I'm having trouble locating my recipe on my desktop; must be in my email), but this one sounds just as good. I like it because it uses low-fat ingredients but doesn't sacrifice taste!  http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/black-bean-lasagna-3  Thanks much for the contest!

t5_2qh17,Kichigai,1375163642,"Oh, I love video engineering too. The only reason I get upset about this stuff is because it creates a huge mess that completely gets in the way of everything else I need to do because my predecessor did something bone headed and I don't have the time to fix it properly. But then I go and reuse some of his wiring to get genlock into rooms that didn't have a hook-up for the house clock, and while re-doing a room I figure out that back in the day running all the AES/EBU snakes to the individual rooms was completely unnecessary because they can all do audio over the same SDI connection they're running the video. That just makes you feel like you accomplished something.  I remember looking at our comms rack, which had this big 12V cooling fan out of a Chevy's radiator bolted to the frame, and it's pointed at a bunch of passive patch bays, blowing air on them. So I just rip it off there, turn it around, and bolt it to the rack holding the SAN, so now it's sucking hot air out.  Keep on top of your basic engineering skills. It might not be as glamorous as being in the driver's seat of a big project, but there's money there, and when things break and you save the whole damn project because you know how to lie to the computer to make things work you become a freaking hero. Learn your underlying computer systems, learn what's under the hood of your NLE, and then learn ever piece of equipment that touches your HD-SDI, *especially* your scope. **AND STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ZIP-TIES**.

He kept saying that Sam was grossly ignorant of the Muslim world and therefore all of his points were invalid, yet when pressed about literalism as a valid approach to ascertaining the validity of these religious texts, he always retreated to contextualization as the key. In other words, all religions have inconsistencies, so it's your interpretation that matters.  You can't have it both ways.   Your religion can't be the One True Religion with The Gift of Everlasting Life for True Believers, stonings and beheadings for rule breakers AND be a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure comic, *Where YOU Make The Story!*‚Ñ¢   Aslan tries to make it seem like we're all just not deep enough or sophisticated enough to get it, but I'm sorry... the reality is that religion is taken seriously by some very scary folks, and they make life very difficult for all of us. His approach makes it impossible to really address these problems in the real world if ""everybody is right all religions are valid and the Truth is in there if you can see it"".    ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2rvat,vi_rus,1375190483,"&gt; &gt; *Fixes forced exposure lock on 0.5 and 1 second time-lapse intervals*  &gt; Does anyone know what that means?   **[Exposure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_\(photography\))**, in photography, refers to the amount of light a lens lets in when taking a picture. A darker subject calls for a longer (time) and larger aperture (lens opening) exposure allowing it to capture more light. If not enough light is let in for whatever reason, the shot is considered under-exposed and will come out too dark. On the other hand, a lighter subject does not require as much light, therefore a shorter (time) and smaller aperture (lens opening) exposure will do. If you let too much light in, though, the shot will come out too light aka over-exposed.  When doing a timelapse with the GoPro HERO3 with 0.5 or 1 second intervals, the camera would base the exposure for each frame on the very first image in the timelapse, essentially ""locking"" the exposure settings. This creates a problem when the subject of your timelapse is going from light -&gt; dark or dark -&gt; light, such as with a sunrise or sunset. If you're creating a timelapse of a sunrise, your first shot (while it's still dark out) would have a long and large aperture exposure. As the sun rises, and there is more available light, the camera would still use the same settings as the original image resulting in over-exposed images.  The fix should remove this exposure lock and allow the camera to adjust the exposure for each shot based on the current available light.  &gt; &gt; *Optimizes compatibility with select microSD cards by reducing data stream rate to 35Mb/sec while recording in 4K, 2.7K and Protune‚Ñ¢ modes (HERO3: Black Edition only).*  &gt; Does that mean lower quality?  Very good question. My guess is that GoPro has found a way around lowering the quality, either by optimizing the codec / compression or perhaps storing video in the RAM while transferring it to the card at a maximum rate of 35mb/sec. This is a total assumption though and an official source would be nice!",‚Ñ¢

Many are, most are aiming for the action movie universe where things like terminology and historical accuracy do not matter. Some games do make a great effort to be historically accurate though. [Red Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gccu5TuqjoU) and the [ARMA series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze6kmUnzTVg) take great strides to portray the weapons and equipment as accurately as possible within the historical setting they respecitvely chose.  &gt; Movies have to be a lot better...

Have a million rounds and never need a reload.  Showing reloads did not used to be ""cool"", films like the Matrix made it cool.

Oh. Well I've never actually shot one :( but I can say with some sense of certainty that they don't last the 5 minutes they are made out to last in the movies. More like 3-4 seconds.

t5_2r6pl,paternova,1375202693,"Thanks!   I purchased 400 laser etched mdf tiles (25mm x 3mm) from eBay for ¬£12ish, and got a 780mm x 450mm mdf board cut at local hardware shop for ¬£10ish. I drew out the grid on the board as guides then stuck the tiles down with wood glue, making sure the mdf tile sat in the centre of each grid square. With a standard BB 30mm grid size, this results in roughly 5mm between each tile.  Once all the tiles were glued down, I took a dremel to the tiles to rough up the edges - basically just running a sanding bit down every gutter without worrying about being neat. This was surprisingly time consuming, and MDF dust isn't particularly good for your health so wrap a shirt round your mouth and nose if you don't have a mask.  Once that was done, I hoovered the board to get rid of sawdust and then started flocking in between the tiles using two or three different grades of gravel. Using multiple grades really helps the scale.  Once that was dry, I undercoated with black spray then started painting. Rather than spending a fortune on proper modelling paints, I picked up some Tester pots from the hardware shop. 50ml of water based paint for something stupid like 70p each - more than enough! I used three different shades of grey, ranging from near black to off white. Start by stippling on the dark shade, followed by the middle one. With the lightest shade, I used the dirty finger‚Ñ¢ technique to smudge it around each tile which gives it a really nice concrete effect. No washing required, or skill for that matter - just get stippling!  Once that was dry, I touched up any glaring unpainted bits, but left a few bits of wood showing through as it ended up adding nice variation to the texture (see bottom left of detail pic). Three coats of matt spray varnish later and I was ready to add vegetation (Army Painter and Gaugemaster) which I glued on with bog standard super glue.   For the pitch markings, I masked off using masking tape (you don't say?) and then stippled on pure white. Done! From start to end probably took about 15-20 hours, including the walk to the hardware shop!  By now you may have realized that a 3 dimensional board with lots of 5mm gutters probably isn't great for rolling dice on - lots of cocked dies. To counter this, you could either make sure the gravel between each tile is level or maybe grout the tiles instead. Grout would be quick and still relatively textured, but you might lose a sense of scale without the different grades of gravel. I'm going a different route and opting to build a matching dice tower; part pragmatism, part venerable tribute to the dice gods.  Thanks again, hope I could provide some inspiration!  **Edit:** Almost forgot to say, I am experiencing a little bit of warp (corners are raised 2-3mm) - probably because one side of the mdf board is covered in wood glue and paint. Not sure what I'm going to do, either treat the other side and hope it balances out or perhaps screw it down to another less treated board.   **Edit 2:** Here's where I got the tiles from - [WargamesTournaments on eBay UK](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/wargamestournaments/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_from=&amp;_ipg=&amp;_trksid=p3686).",‚Ñ¢

t5_2s3ta,ZethSayber,1375209400,"First off, please don't take my advice as too harsh if you can. No one gains anything when one wants to hurt feelings and they just say ""attaboy!"" and move on.  I think the fundamental problems are how much paint you're using and where it's going. The first thing to do if you want to get better is thin your paints down with water. You don't need a lot, but if you do it your coats will go on smoother and look more even. His arm closest to us is a good example. Look at the chitin above his talons and how the detail on the edges is melted away and now what was supposed to be sharp, armored plating looks more rounded and dull. You've managed to avoid this on some of the larger areas, but that might have been luck.  As another poster mentioned, there is also an issue with the colors here. Take a look at the studio paint job for a Carnivean. There's a lot of places that you've painted the skin color (looks like P3 frostbite from the prepackaged Legion colors?) and they should actually be your chitin/scales/plating/whatever in black. If you meant it to be that way, that's fine as there's always room for alternative paint schemes, but to make it convincing you'll need to do a lot more work. Right now it looks more like you just weren't sure what was supposed to be what on the model.  As far as my suggestions go, in addition to thinning your paints, I'll also add that you should make or pick up some washes. Games Workshop makes some great pre-mixed ones that are all often lauded as ""Skill in a Bottle‚Ñ¢"" which can take a mediocre or average paint job to the next level. If you are indeed using Frostbite, let me know and I've got a great suggestion for what to do with it (it's the base color for all my Legion).  When you get the washes down you can highlight in the base coat color too, and it'll really bring another level of detail that gets models looking great for tabletop use. If you wanna go further, take what someone else said and try drybrushing as well as mixing paints for even higher highlights. You're getting there, don't get discouraged. My first heavy was a Carnivean and didn't look far off from this.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2s8bl,OliveBranchMLP,1375210286,"It's obvious from the review that the man has never heard of bronies. And I think that gives this review a remarkably fresh, unbiased perspective, from the eyes of someone who isn't aware of the hype that we tend to generate for things like this. It highlighted a big problem that I think most bronies tend to either ignore or not notice at all.  I've long since believed that MLP: Equestria Girls is a great, hilarious, and immensely entertaining movie... for bronies. And, judging by the fandom's general approval of it, I'm right. It's intently obvious that the creators wanted very much to appeal to dually appeal to both us and to the intended demographic of small girls, and it seems to have done so successfully.  But the problem is that those two target audiences are ridiculously *narrow*. Bronies are bronies; we love self-referential humor that alludes to our existence or makes light of things unique to our fandom, which Equestria Girls delivers in spades. But that humor isn't *universal*; only we get it, like a meme or an in-joke. And that's the problem with modern MLP: its appeal is solely limited to little girls and bronies, but not adults on a whole.  It‚Äôs regressed into what we expect from a typical show for little girls; predictable plotlines about the ‚ô•‚ô™‚òÖ MAGIC OF FRIENDSHIP OOH LA LA ‚ô•‚ô™‚òÖ, sprinkled with just enough culturally-aware in-jokes to keep the bronies entertained despite the fact that there isn‚Äôt really any depth past the self-referential humor.  This is not Faust-era FIM, where depth and humor were intertwined in equal parts like a great Pixar movie. The movie wasn‚Äôt funny for the sake of its own cleverness, but rather by playing old jokes for laughs. Which is still funny, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but only to a very limited audience; it has little longevity or appeal to anyone outside the rabid brony fandom. You literally need to have seen the vast majority of the show and maybe waddled around in the fandom a bit in order to find even half the movie funny.  I enjoyed it. I truly, honestly, enjoyed it. But unless its nature as a spinoff means it‚Äôs an isolated incident, I don‚Äôt really feel like it bodes well for the future of FIM if season 4 is anything like this, especially not in regards to its universal appeal.  As much as I loved the movie, I would not show EqG to a non-brony. I would cringe if someone attempted to.",‚ô•

And of course his opinion is [not unique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch#Rabbi_Shmuel_Eidels).  But if you think it was a good idea for Rambam to write MT, and that people should go with that, then why *shouldn't* the BY have recorded other opinions? And once he did that, why *shouldn't* the Rema have offered how it looked from his side? And so on until today...  I'd say the question is actually a lot smaller on those who walked through the door the Rambam had opened than on the Rambam himself.  &gt; Although one cute thing is I heard Hasdai Crescas criticized the BY as making halacha too narrow and lazy-minded.

In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation¬Æ3 systems. For Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs.  This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.  For PlayStation¬Æ3, the game ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game.

t5_2s3db,throwaway_for_PII,1375219332,"Let's try to get all the pertinent information in one place.  --- **To check if your information was compromised:** (from [AustinCorgiBart](http://www.reddit.com/r/udel/comments/1jck1d/ud_digital_security_breech_72000_social_security/cbddmum) and the [UD IT Security Response FAQ ""What Should I Do?""](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/index.html))  1. If you have a UD email, check your email. If you do not, skip to #3. (I cannot check mine for what the email looks like at this time. If someone could provide a screenshot with PII blurred it would help.) 1. If you do not see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder, a lot of the emails are ending up there. 1. If you do not have a UD email, use http://www.udel.edu/it/response/ 1. If the site is giving you time-out errors and such, just wait a little bit and then keep trying. It seems the UD community is friendly DDOSing. (Much like what tends to happen when open course registration begins)  --- **What to do if your information has been compromised:** (from the [UD IT Security Response FAQ ""What Should I Do?""](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/index.html) and personal experience)  1. In any situation in which your personal information is leaked, take actions to monitor things to ensure your information is not used by others. In an event in which changeable information is leaked, such as Credit/Debit Card numbers or passwords, change them as soon as possible. In the event of this incident, UD claims ""Information in the compromised files includes names, addresses of record, Social Security numbers and UD IDs (employee identification numbers)."". These cannot be changed, so the best that can be done is monitoring for misuse.  1. UD is offering a free 3 year membership to a credit monitoring service through ""Kroll Advisory Solutions to provide identity theft safeguards at no cost to you for a three-year period through its ID TheftSmart‚Ñ¢ program"". Information for sign up can be found in the email you've been sent, or in a letter (presumably sent to the last address you have on file with them).  (Following from [UD IT Security Response FAQ ""What Should I Do?""](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/index.html)) &gt;The two most important services UD is offering through Kroll are credit monitoring and identity theft consultation services. &gt; &gt;First, UD is providing free access to Kroll‚Äôs credit monitoring service for 36 months. **You must activate within six months from the date of the notification.** Once activated, **you will be notified by email when your credit files show certain credit activity in your name that is commonly associated with identify theft.** &gt; &gt;Second, UD is providing free access to Kroll‚Äôs licensed investigators for three years from the date of notification. Kroll‚Äôs team has expertise in solving problems associated with identity theft and potential identity theft. The investigators will be available to listen to your concerns, answer your questions and offer their expertise regarding any issues you may have noticed. **Should your credit be affected by this incident, an investigator will help you restore your identity to pre-theft status. This service will be provided at no cost to you.**   1. Beyond the services offered through UD, take personal action by putting out a credit fraud alert on yourself. This will make it more difficult to open new lines of credit, for both you and anyone else trying to use your information, and will prompt deeper identity checks when you try to do so. These last for 90 days and also allow you to request a free credit report from one of the 3 big credit monitoring agencies. I highly recommend following the first two immediate steps [here](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0274-immediate-steps-repair-identity-theft) just as safe practice to regularly monitor your credit for fraud.  ---   **Known information about the hack:** (as of time written, taken from [UDaily](http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2014/jul/resources073013.html), [ABC Action News](http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news%2Flocal&amp;id=9189667), and the [UD IT Security Response Pages/FAQs](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/index.html))  * Employee records of 72,000 people, which includes names, addresses of record, Social Security numbers and UD IDs (employee identification numbers) were ""compromised"" in a cyberattack which occurred on or about July 17, 2013.  * A criminal attack on one of the University‚Äôs systems took advantage of a vulnerability in software acquired from a vendor. Several dozen other companies, agencies, and organizations have also been subjected to attacks taking advantage of the same software vulnerability. According to an article in the July 16, 2013, New York Times, many large research universities across the country have been subjected to attacks over the last days and weeks. The incident at the University of Delaware is neither unique nor the largest security breach in higher education.   * UD is working with both the FBI and a leading data security firm to determine what happened and where the breach may have come from; what other UD-maintained systems, if any, may have been attacked; and whether any other confidential information may have been exposed.  * UD is already making changes to their network in consultation with the FBI, their data security consultant and other universities whose systems have been breached in the past.  &gt;[""Who is going to cover the costs involved?""](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/what.html)  &gt;UD is not passing the costs incurred for the investigation or credit monitoring services to any UD constituency.  &gt;[""Will the University change the way they store Social Security numbers as a result of this incident?""](http://www.udel.edu/it/response/forward.html)  &gt;We continually assess and improve our information security policies and procedures to ensure we are in line with both IT industry and higher education IT best practices. Further, we are evaluating our systems and processes in consultation with the FBI, our data security consultant and other universities whose systems have been breached in the recent past. UD complies with HIPAA, FERPA and all other federal and state laws designed to protect your private information. UD will continue to exercise caution and continually improve safeguards for protecting your personal information.   --- **Criticisms/Unanswered Questions**  * If this hack occurred around July 17th, and a trend of these types of hacks was ""publicly"" known as of July 16th, why did it take UD until July 29th to begin to acknowledge this happened?  * Why the hell isn't this in the main banner rotation on the UD homepage?  * Why is this the 2nd UDaily story under the UDaily header on the UD homepage instead of the first?  * Really, why the hell isn't this some sort of huge red banner on the homepage?  * Why has UD still not gotten its servers into shape to be able to handle this kind of usage load (on the ""Check if your info has been compromised page"") without suffering unintentional DDOS? They have similar issues with instability, slowdown, and timed out connections every time open course registration comes around.  * Why is UD not being direct about how the SSNs were stored? If they were encrypted, that would do wonders for how this incident currently looks to the public. This leads me to believe that the SSNs were not in fact encrypted. Otherwise they would address this. So why were the SSNs not encrypted? Why were the SSNs connected to our employee ID numbers accessible from any system unrelated to background checks and payroll anyway (assuming the compromised software was not related to either of those).  ---  This is just an overview of what I found pertinent out of all the websites with information on this at this time. As with anything relating to finding information on the UD website, your best bet is to look for yourself on every single webpage on the site that is even tangentially related, because the websites are designed horribly in terms of information availability and flow. I hope this helps.  ^(I thought my days of dealing with UD's BS was over when I dropped out and recently transferred schools. I guess this is what I get for LAing CISC108 that one time.)",‚Ñ¢
t5_2rlwc,olympic_lifter,1375219885,"Hard to see much of the lift from that angle, especially the jerk. It would help to be able to see all of you and the bar throughout the lift, though of course space requirements are understood.  Two huge issues are going on: 1) you're ripping it right off the floor, and 2) you're doing everything from your toes.  When discussing cleans/snatches, we generally talk about the first pull, second pull, sometimes third pull, catch, and recovery. The first pull and second pull justly receive all the attention, as they are the parts where the most things go wrong. The first pull is the portion of the lift beginning when the bar leaves the floor and ending when the bar reaches about the upper thigh or the hips, where you transition into triple extension (almost simultaneous extension of the hips, knees, and ankles), which we call the second pull.  This is important, because it highlights the fact that the explosive part of the lift does *not* begin until the upper thighs at the earliest - at least, it *should* not. In your case you are ripping the bar right off the floor, almost like you're going for the second pull immediately. This is setting you up for a Bad Time‚Ñ¢.  Specifically, it will be difficult to ever catch the clean in a full squat, especially without just catching it high and riding it down, it will put the bar too far out front, it will cause you to pull more with your arms and get less out of the legs, and it will throw off your timing in the catch (your cleans are crashing a bit down onto you).  Before getting down into the nitty-gritty, it's most important to get you into the basic idea that the first part of the lift is about staying in position while moving the bar closer to your body as it approaches the point where you can explode into triple extension. In your case, it's actually happening slightly below mid-thigh, but because you're in such a rush you're already on your toes by the time the bar reaches your knees.  So, since you can only work on so many things at a time, I would start by keeping your shoulders more over the bar and slowing down your first pull, waiting on the explosion until the bar is as high as possible. Make sure you can feel your heels in contact with the ground right until that point of explosion. You should also start with the bar at least a couple inches further away from your shins; that way it will come toward you better off the floor and you won't have to make up for its lack of horizontal momentum in the right direction later in the lift.  There's plenty in the jerk, too, but let's start with the idea that you have to dip and drive straight up and down, and you need to keep your heels on the floor all the way until you start to explode back up. At the moment, you're driving off your toes and shooting your back leg behind you, rather than letting your front leg travel forward as you catch it in a split. Fixing the dip and drive will make it easier for you to put the front leg out where it belongs, and when you catch it you should have the weight perfectly balanced between both legs.  I hope that's a good start. None of these are things you can fix in a week, and most will be something you might be working to improve throughout the time that you choose to do the Olympic lifts.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r94o,cyber_rigger,1375220457,"Use the Force -- turn off javascript.  ___________  Keeping Band-Aids On By Carolyn Shearlock, copyright 2011 . All rights reserved.  Okay, I‚Äôll admit that keeping Band-Aids‚Ñ¢ on isn‚Äôt an issue just in the galley, but all over a boat.  Heck, it‚Äôs an issue anywhere if you‚Äôre active.  But I justify covering it here for several reasons:      With the motion of the boat I got more cuts, scrapes and minor burns than I did living ashore;      Cuts and scrapes would always be on places like my knuckles, where it was hard to keep a bandage on in the first place;      Washing dishes by hand (plus swimming and just perspiration living without air conditioning) always resulted in Band-Aids‚Ñ¢ coming off, as did just crawling around to get to various lockers;      I was likely to get into more dirt and ‚Äúgunk‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that I needed Band-Aids to stay on more than ever; and      [Drumroll] I learned the solution!  Almost as soon as we moved aboard Que Tal, Dave and I had problems keeping any sort of adhesive bandage on.  Band-Aids, butterflies, Steri-Strips, mole skin, and adhesive tape just came off in a matter of minutes (if we were lucky, hours).  We had to come up with a solution!  One evening at a dock party, I was asking a more experienced cruiser if they knew of any way to keep Band-Aids on, and the woman behind me overheard my question and gave me the answer I was seeking:  tincture of benzoin!  She was an anesthesiologist and told me that when doctors use butterfly bandages or Steri-Strips in place of stitches, they always swab the skin where they want the bandage to stick with tincture of benzoin.  While I don‚Äôt remember her name ‚Äî her boat was Long Tall Sally ‚Äî she even had an extra bottle that she was willing to give us.  Tincture of benzoin works wonders.  I have no idea why it‚Äôs not widely known, but I‚Äôm doing my part to spread the word.  Seems to me that it should be in everyone‚Äôs first aid kit ‚Äî shore dwellers as well as boaters!  It‚Äôs simple to use.  I found a Q-Tip to be the best applicator if the bottle doesn‚Äôt come with one, and just dipped it in the bottle then wiped it where the bandage should stick.  Let it dry just a few seconds ‚Äî about as long as it takes to pick up the Band-Aid and take it out of its wrapper ‚Äî and then put the bandage on.  Now, before putting the cap back on, wipe the threads well.  If you leave some of the liquid on the threads, it will do just as good a job of keeping the cap on as you want it to do with the Band-Aid.  I‚Äôve had to use pliers to get the cap off when I neglected this step!  A bottle will last for several years ‚Äî I think we had that original bottle for 7 years!  And then, I only replaced it because I couldn‚Äôt get all the dried gunk off the threads and it was really hard to open the bottle.  While bandages stick much better, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre applying them with the medical equivalent of 5200 ‚Äî it won‚Äôt be a problem to get them off when you need to.  Many U.S. pharmacies carry tincture of benzoin, but you often have to ask for it.  We never could find it in Mexico or Central America.  We now live in a small rural town in the US, and two of four pharmacies in town carry it.  NOTE:  Tincture of benzoin (also called compound tincture of benzoin) is NOT the same thing as Betadine‚Ñ¢, tincture of iodine or other antiseptics.  In researching this article, I discovered that REI now sells tincture of benzoin specifically as an ‚Äúadhesive for bandages‚Äù (link to REI‚Äôs tincture of benzoin).  Not only is theirs a little pricy, but it also has a flip-top lid (as do some for sale elsewhere).  I HATE those on a boat as they motion of the boat always seems to pop them open ‚Äî leaving a big mess and nothing in the bottle when you need it.  Look for a screw-on cap instead.  You can also buy tincture of benzoin already on swabs and packed in individual foil pouches.  I have not used these, but they seem like they‚Äôd be handy for taking with you on hikes, and you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry that you won‚Äôt be able to open the bottle, but they are pricier per use than a bottle.  Even in foil pouches, it‚Äôs a good idea to store them in a Ziploc bag as they can dry out.  If you can‚Äôt get tincture of benzoin locally ‚Äî or just don‚Äôt want to deal with running from one pharmacy to another ‚Äî the best source I‚Äôve found is Amazon:      Screw-top bottle with dauber (4 oz.)     Package of 50 swab sticks  They also sell tincture of benzoin as a spray, but I‚Äôm afraid that the spray nozzle would quickly clog.  Admittedly, I haven‚Äôt tried using a spray bottle, so it may be okay.  Here‚Äôs hoping you won‚Äôt need Band-Aids too often . . . but if you do, at least you‚Äôll know how to keep them on!",‚Ñ¢

CPU:  Chose the i5 4570 because it's the cheapest i5 processor you can purchase that still has TSX-NI incorporated in it.  Here's a little splurb from overclock.net (no you can't overclock it)  &gt;I'd get the 4570, as the 4430 lacks TSX-NI and can only Turbo +2 bins (or 200MHz) over its standard speed instead of the 4570's +4 bins, and the 4670 costs ~10% more while only being ~6% faster (which won't make a difference in GPU-limited games).  Here's a splurb about TSX-NI from Intel's [website.](http://ark.intel.com/products/75043/Intel-Core-i5-4570-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_60-GHz?wapkw=4570) &gt;Intel¬Æ Transactional Synchronization Extensions New Instructions (Intel¬Æ TSX-NI) are a set of instructions focused on multi-threaded performance scaling.  This technology helps make parallel operations more efficient via improved control of locks in software.  So really what this will do, is it will fully optimise your CPU and its cores when you're doing editing work, for the lowest price available.  You might fall in love with this feature because it will make it more efficient over other processors when performing editing tasks.  Motherboard:  It's an H85 chipset, which isn't really meant for gaming, but this one is fine because it actually still supports Crossfire, which is odd.  Either way you still won't notice any bad performance from it, as it supports up to 64GB of ram and two GPUs.  Also has plenty of SATA connectors (2-3gb/s and 4-6gb/s), six channel audio, and a good LAN controller.  Really all you'll need.  Memory:  8GB of RAM.  The ram's stock voltages are higher than Haswell likes, so it might run at a slightly reduced clock speed, but nothing major, and it won't cause anything to explode.  Also sorry it doesn't look pretty, it just doesn't have a heat spreader on it.  Storage:  A 1TB hard drive.  In the colonies it's usual for the Caviar Blues to be cheaper than these, these have lots of RAID support options for servers and stuff.  As far as I have read though the thing is still good as a PC HDD, so alas it sits here.  Video Card:  Probably the best low-end video card available (in my opinion).  Most 7850s or GTX 650ti's are 1GB, and usually only have 1 fan for cooling.  Yes, the 1GB of VRAM is a downside, but the upside is you get a super-awesomely cooled card that can easily be overclocked with MSI afterburner for extra performance.  In the future if there simply isn't enough VRAM you could always just purchase a new card or get a second 7850 and crossfire them.  Case:  It's plain, made by a good case company, and well liked.  It serves your purposes.  PSU:  Small, reliable, efficient.  This PSU fits your build as it is, but unfortunately despite how awesome it is, it would require upgrading if you wanted to get larger or more video cards.  If you were to get a second 7850, under full load the power usage would get close to 450W, which is danger close.     Optical Drive:  Not necessary unless you need it.  Feel free to not get this.  Windows 8 because you didn't mention if you had an operating system or not, so I got you 8.",¬Æ

I know you won a neighborhood double dutch contest when you were eleven by cheating. Yeah, I saw you put tacks into Shayla's special jump roping shoes. She didn't stand a chance, once those pins started stabbing her in the feet. And don't even deny it was you who tied Lacey's laces together so she fell and hurt her knee too badly to compete. I ain't saying you've got no balls, but I'm saying  I know what you did. I never jumped rope again after I saw you, my idol, cheat to get to the top.  I know you sometimes take bubble baths in spaghetti sauce. I'm too traumatized to explain that one much more.  I know you have an affinity for cloaked clown figurines, and that you run the black market on ceramic cats, as well. I also am aware of the counterfeit business you've got going on in which you lop the horns off of ceramic cow statues and sand down the hooves so you can sell them to unsuspecting cat lovers. Well I'm no dummy, and I know a cow when I see one.    My item: I really would like this super large container of parmesan cheese. Stop. Stop laughing! Shut your mouth; this isn't a laughing matter!

I am certainly open for correction, a healthy sense of skepticism about even your own opinions is an important part of intellectual maturity, and a tolerance of - indeed, a desire for - the insights of others is necessary in the dialectic search for truth. However, given the language and manner in which you responded to my point about the history of division, schism, and heresy among Christians from the very beginnings (see Acts 5 and 15, II Peter 2, Galatians 2 and 5, and I Corinthians 1, 2, and 11, and the Johannine letters, among others), I feel that, despite by usual inclination towards graciousness and gregariousness, the response most appropriate to your tone of reply would be: [thus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY&amp;hd=1)  I would further like to state that I was **not** in any sense saying that the Church (capital ‚ÄúC‚Äù) was ever divided (the three Creeds clearly state otherwise); I was only saying that Christians have had division, schism, and heresy from the beginning. And, quite frankly, painting a rosy picture of the One Truly Holy Early Church‚Ñ¢, always united in perfect harmony against those evil heretics and infidels, is false and counterproductive to a true understanding of the history of Christians and Christianity, filled as it is with hypocrisy, politics, miscommunication, and personality conflict (among a great deal of other nasty stuff we seem to prefer to ignore).",‚Ñ¢

t5_2udq6,TIGit,1375274963,"We would enjoy it, but it's happening *now*. Hell, John Deere already has tractors that don't have a spot for a driver because they drive themselves. They look like big green spaceships out in Waterloo, IA. For instance have yuou ever seen The Bean in Chicago? They look exactly like that, except John Deere colors. Deere hasn't named them yet, and they aren't released, but they are out ""in testing"" to area farmers in the general region of JD World Headquarters in Moline, IL.  Harvesters run on GPS for straight driving rows and use stability tools to adjust cab/corn heads, the combine does all the processing and measures the bushels per acre, moisture content, etc. The ""driver"" in a modern combine has a fridge for beer and a reclining seat to take naps in. It's' called Greenstar for Deere.  &gt; GreenStar‚Ñ¢ - The GreenStar AutoTrac System is a hands-free steering system for straight-line operations. Since it's accurate within inches with the new RTK System or +/- 4 inches with the new SF2 signal, it's ideal for use in tillage, spraying, and seeding operations.The new working range for AutoTrac (.3 mph to 18.6 mph) lets the operator choose what speed is right for them to obtain maximum in-field productivity.   &gt;Satellite and StarFire‚Ñ¢ - StarFire is a global position tracking system added to John Deere equipment that can predict and maintain accuracy within 2cm.  &gt; AutoTrac‚Ñ¢ - AutoTrac is easy to use. First, set the first pass (Track 0) from the GreenStar display. The system will ""draw"" lines that are parallel to Track 0. Simply press a button on your tractor's CommandARM‚Ñ¢, and AutoTrac will steer your tractor down these parallel lines. Once you are at the end of the row simply turn the tractor around press the Resume switch on the tractor's CommandARM and let go of the wheel.  Other tractors you program the first to drive/harvest/plant a certain route of rows and you can have a whole fleet of other tractors tuned to follow that one's direct path or parallel to it.  Cow barns often have automated feed so nobody has to haul grains out in buckets by hand to the herds. And hog farms are notorious for their automated processes (which admittedly need some tweaking as machinery, computer controlled gates, etc often crushes pigs to death in mishaps). But live animals always add some uncertainty into a calculated program, ya know?   But that's just what is here now. In the future? It will be much more automated. However this automation poses risks and challenges. Big corporate owned factory farms have money and access to these technologies. Small blood-land family farms don't have the means to automate. It's sort of a slower version of how factory owners came into so much money and dominance by crushing it and buying up the competition. Plus the media and society push our younger generations into wanting to leave the homestead and go to college or exciting locales. They instill city dreams. So we have this mass exodus of farm kids because the farm owners can afford to send their kids to college and beyond, we're not talking farm hands whose children will be locked into working the land through poverty and family dependants. The factory farms hire the hands' kids who stay because they can't leave. The farm owners' kids can't get out fast enough. And old farm owners who wanted to pass down their farms are having to sell to corporates when the old farmers can't work the land and their children don't want to work the land. Ending the generations of a family directly tied to that land by birth, death, and blood. For instance, my great great great grandfather started our farm. And up until my grandmother each generation of that family line was born, raised, died, and was buried on that land. It's a part of us, woven into our hearts and minds. The factory farms are soulless monsters. No values, tradition, or cares about the rural community. The land isn't loved, it is a means to an end a resource gone uncherished. The animals are more mistreated. It's scary.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qstm,JoeZee,1375280636,"Polly Williams, a single mother who had recently lost her job, was desperate to lower the payments on her $23,000 in student loans. So last June, she called one of the many companies advertising debt relief online.For a $250 fee, the University of One, now known as Student Consulting Group, offered to help. To come up with the money, Williams skipped an electric bill and lost power, forcing her to throw out $150 of food in her refrigerator, she said.Williams could have avoided the fee because the government offers borrower assistance programs for free. Still, a growing student-loan debt-relief industry is profiting from consumers‚Äô confusion and desperation, charging as much as $1,600 to sign them up for these repayment plans, according to a report released last month by the Boston-based National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy and research group.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disgusting, it really is,‚Äù said Williams, 54, who earns $26,000 a year as an executive assistant for a Cleveland nonprofit helping the terminally ill. ‚ÄúI can only imagine how many other people they are taking advantage of.‚ÄùSuch companies are proliferating because borrowers are buckling under the weight of student loans, which now total $1 trillion, exceeding all other consumer debt aside from mortgages. Former students are also struggling to navigate the government‚Äôs often complicated assistance programs. Student loans are among the most onerous forms of debt because they can rarely be canceled through bankruptcy.After the housing bubble burst, similar outfits targeted consumers facing foreclosure and those behind on their credit cards, leading state and federal regulators to crack down on abuses.Student-loan debt relief companies say they are comparable to organizations that help taxpayers file their returns ‚Äì something customers could also do for free.‚ÄúStudent loans are one of the biggest debts in America,‚Äù Scott Klein, vice president and managing partner of Student Consulting Group, said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúWe saw the opportunity to get involved in this process and try to help every single person out that we can.‚ÄùStudent Consulting Group, based in Tampa, Fla., typically charges a fee equal to 1 percent of the defaulted loan amount, with prices varying depending on the work required to get a borrower back on track, Klein said. The maximum cost is $1,500, he said. Its website discloses that the government offers free help, company officials said.The Better Business Bureau of West Florida last July revoked Student Consulting Group‚Äôs accreditation. The bureau listed 37 complaints in the past three years, noting a pattern of allegations that the company received payment for services it didn‚Äôt provide, according to a report from the organization.Williams, who filed a Better Business Bureau complaint, said the company charged her but didn‚Äôt come up with a better payment plan.On her own, Williams got in touch with a debt-collection company working for the Education Department, she said. Williams spent 10 minutes filling out forms to sign up for a new plan, which reduced her monthly outlays to $8 from $136, she said.Student Consulting Group disputes her account, saying her lower payments resulted directly from its efforts.‚ÄúShe hired us to do a negotiation on a loan,‚Äù Klein said. ‚ÄúWe did a negotiation.‚ÄùThe Better Business Bureau complaints represent a small fraction of Student Consulting Group‚Äôs business of about 10,000 customers, Klein said. The company told the bureau that customers can experience service delays when they don‚Äôt disclose full details of their financial condition.The government has an array of free borrower-assistance programs. Former students can temporarily stop payments or make smaller ones because of hardships, such as an illness or job loss. Borrowers can sign up for plans that tie payments to their incomes and the size of their families. In some cases, over time, the loans can be forgiven. Former students can consolidate multiple loans into a single debt with one payment.Consumers often find it difficult to sign up for the government programs because they are ‚Äúunnecessarily complex,‚Äù and the government confronts them with ‚Äúan impenetrable bureaucracy,‚Äù according to the National Consumer Law Center‚Äôs report.Companies take advantage of those shortcomings and mischaracterize government programs as their own, said Deanne Loonin, a law-center attorney and author of the report, which calls for stepped-up federal and state regulatory enforcement.The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has heard from borrowers who say that companies are marketing special plans that can save thousands of dollars in loan payments, said Rohit Chopra, the agency‚Äôs student-loan ombudsman.‚ÄúIt is not a special deal,‚Äù Chopra said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often a program they are entitled to by law.‚ÄùThe law center report cites the website of a company called Student Loan Relief, based in Dallas, which says it has ‚Äúdeveloped programs that will assist nearly every one of the 40 million Americans that currently carry student loan debt.‚ÄùFinding help from the government ‚Äúcan be a daunting task for those of us without Ph.D.‚Äôs in Law,‚Äù according to the website. Only ‚Äúin the rare instance‚Äù can a borrower ‚Äúlocate a program and comply with requirements to participate.‚ÄùStudent Loan Relief‚Äôs programs are unique because they are packages of government programs, said Jason Spencer, its chief executive officer.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs help out there for everyone, but no one knows about it,‚Äù Spencer said.The company charges no more than $46 for its services, and nothing upfront, and plans to become a nonprofit, Spencer said.

t5_2qh0u,WeaponsGradeHumanity,1375281071,"Actually, the pluralisation doesn't come from the company but from traditional English.  You see, while 'legos' is not the right term to use for your blocks, neither would you call a piece 'a lego'.  You always say 'a lego block' or something like that.    In fact, the company gives the appropriate name (for which 'lego' is an abbreviation) as ""[LEGO Bricks and Toys](http://www.legos.com)"".  There's even an official statement which you can read [here](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO) and other places which says:    &gt;The word LEGO¬Æ is a brand name and is very special to all of us in the LEGO Group Companies. We would sincerely like your help in keeping it special. Please always refer to our bricks as 'LEGO Bricks or Toys' and not 'legos.' By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud and that stands for quality the world over. Thank you! Susan Williams, Consumer Services.    So it's not that 'lego' is a coined plural but that it inherits pluralisation from 'bricks and toys'.  This is because an abbreviation must retain all the same behaviours as the fragment being abbreviated.  ",¬Æ
t5_2qh1i,Beard_of_Valor,1375281855,"Also considering that their largest lever to ""move"" Harry is ""Moody""... I imagine Moody was acting alone at first, having just escaped (because his mom died for him in Azkaban because she was dying of natural causes anyhow). This would be a great way for him to preserve his cover, but use his position to covertly put Harry in danger, and in the spotlight where others who wish to hurt him could find him easily for direct or even indirect influence (make the tasks harder by supplying angrier dragons or something).   It's never really spelled out, but adapting that plan to something that MOVES him instead (as he receives instructions at last from his master), it's a pretty clear path to getting Harry where they want WHEN they want (potions can be finicky that way, e.g. Polyjuice). It was a sure point in time for which they could control his location to plan their revive potion‚Ñ¢. All while maintaining Moody's cover.",‚Ñ¢

The choices on offer will depend which model of REGZA TV you own, but you‚Äôll sometimes see dedicated control buttons for DVD or Blu-ray players too.  If all your devices are connected using HDMI, that single remote can control all your kit. Just flick the switch and start jabbing at its buttons. You‚Äôll find functions like volume control work without a second remote, and your DVD player can be turned on or off, and playback controlled without reaching for another controller.*   ____________   Follow the next steps please:  Step 1 -- Connect HDMI cable on TV and Video Device.  Step 2 -- Select the HDMI Input.  Step 3 -- After completing the connections, set the REGZA-LINK Setup menu as you desire  Step 4 -- Enable REGZA-LINK item is set to On.  Step 5 -- To set the REGZA-LINK¬Æ Setup:  Step 6 -- From the Setup menu, highlight REGZA-LINK Setup and press Enter .  Step 7 -- Press up or down to highlight Enable REGZA-LINK.
