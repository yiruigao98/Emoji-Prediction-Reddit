t5_mouw,Jacobs01,1357032520,"With today’s business scenario being so competitive, it is becoming increasing difficult for companies to achieve substantial profits. As a matter of the fact, many companies are finding it extremely difficult to even cover up their running cost. Although earning profits today is equally tough for every company, different organizations use different coping strategies. Many try to increase their productivity with the limited resources they have at their disposal. When such companies are unable to achieve this, which happens quite often, they usually choose to reduce their running costs by letting go off some of their employees. Conversely, some companies avoid these two extreme reactions and play smartly by using solutions that improves productivity without increasing the running cost. [Video Teleconference](http://www.rhubcom.com/v4/user_manual/user-manual-TurboMeet-features-show-monitor.htm) is one such viable solution that more and more companies are adopting for improving their productivity. When viewed in the context of the problem at hand, Video Teleconference may not appear of much value. However, there is absolutely no doubt that in future this service is going to be a big game changer. Today, more and more companies are waking up to the fact that Video Teleconference can help them streamline their operations. With Video Teleconference services they can improve their productivity and still retain their existing employees. All round the world, employees are voicing their opinions about where and how they want to work. To their credit, today’s companies of are more receptive to their employees’ concern. The combination of these two trends, employees voicing their opinions and companies taking them into account when making business-related decisions, have brought the importance of Video Teleconference tool into the view.  As far as profits and business growth is concerned, [web conferencing](http://www.rhubcom.com/) tools are an outright winner. It is indeed a pragmatic decision to allow employees to work from multiple locations as it improves both productivity and profits. A recent study shows that expanding collaboration and greater communication throughout the organization has the same effect as 2 hours of additional productive work by each employee per day. Through one of its reports, Cisco® Connected World Technology voices similar opinions by declaring that by the year 2015 about 200 million workers all-round the globe would benefit from Video Teleconference services. At present, many companies are providing [Net Meeting](http://www.gomeetnow.com/) services. These services are hundred times better than the services that were on offer 10 years back. Superior, easy-to-use Video Teleconference services along with the latest audio conferencing solutions is an economical and effective medium to communicate with your employees. Companies can use Video Teleconference services to improve their business communication structure and to interact with their workforce and clients.  When a company uses the high-end conferencing services, such as the ones available today, they are able to save substantial amount of money which they otherwise would have spend on in-person conferences. Video Teleconference services can be used for holding annual meetings and press conferences as well as for other purposes such as conducting employee training or a client meeting.  To sum it up, the smarter companies are using Video Teleconference tools, such as RHUB Video Teleconference appliances, for not only achieving the break-even point, but for also registering substantial profits.

t5_2r1ip,cornelius_z,1357053873,"For anyone new, or unexperienced with cameras. Here's a little simple breakdown on what this means!   **Dynamic Range -**   Dynamic range in photography and video describes the ratio between the maximum and minimum measurable light intensities (white and black, respectively).   [Here's a great article in which I just copied that top part from!] (http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm)   20 stops of DR is **HUGE** Remember when we all lost our minds over the Black Magic offering 13 stops? (let's forget price for a moment.)  Previously we got 13.5 stops of DR with the Red Epic (and Scarlet) and 18 stops if we shot HDRx™  [Article on what HDRx™ is] (http://www.red.com/faqs/hdrx/overview)  But that's not all.  This is 20 stops of DR at **6k!** and ~~60~~ **80 fps**  what the balls man!   ~~Huge~~ **MASSIVE** resolution, and at a very flexible and fast frame rate. Can't get much better.  However as stated in the article, this upgrade (which was expected to be accesible for the Scarlet camera.) Won't be. So Red Scarlet uses will either have to live with it, or trade their camera in for a discount on a Red Epic.   ",™
t5_2qh16,super_monkey_ball,1357054493,"Copyright is a 2 way street. For example:  fb39ca4 makes a very popular series of cartoon characters for children. Being the GGG that he is, he uses these characters to create educational programmes for kids.   However, during his lifetime the copyright expires on said cartoon characters. Philip Morris comes along and decides to use the characters to promote their awesome new brand of cigarettes. The cartoon characters become synonymous with smoking (yes, I know that there are strict laws regarding the packaging and promotion of cigarettes but the point still stands).

I, for one, remember when people derided Mascherano as a waste of money when we first bought him, and it wasn't until the 2nd  leg of the Arsenal game that he proved he could do something (mainly stop The World's Greatest Striker Ever™ from scoring in the dying moments of that game.) Look at Mascherano now. Nobody in their right mind would think that he is not a central part of our team (due to Puyol injuries etc.)  I'm pretty sure the same logic applies to Modric.

Open Xcode, go to preferences, install the command line tools. 3. Install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) 4. In Homebrew, install `ghc`, `rbenv`, and `ruby-build`   + `ghc` provides a gcc-compatable compiler   + `rbenv` lets you manage ruby versions   + `ruby-build` allows you to easily install new ruby versions 5. [Follow the additional install instructions for homebrew rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x) 6. Restart your shell 7. Type the following: `rbenv install 1.9.3-p327`. If you set up rbenv and ruby-build properly earlier, you should see your system download and install the latest versions of ruby. 8. Once thats finished, type `rbenv global 1.9.3-p327`. This sets your global version of ruby to the latest stable release. 9. Type `gem install bundler rails` 10. Type `rbenv rehash` 11. Enjoy your new rails installation",™

I also hear the recent update to the 920 has helped.It might be interesting to note (if you are UK based) that the 920 ends its EE exclusivity in mid-Feb.

t5_2tduo,TheFunDontStop,1357087408,"that doesn't have anything to do with your reasoning though. you are arguing that sexual orientation can be considered a form of bigotry if the class of people that someone is not sexually attracted to is also an oppressed class.  why would that logic apply only to heterosexual people and not, say, gay men? you can't just hand-wave it with oppression™, because gay men can oppress people and heterosexual people can be oppressed (via intersectionality).  edit: also, tangential point. why are we discussing homophobia in the first place, wouldn't it be more sexism? i.e. 'heterosexuality is sexist because it discriminates along gender lines'. heterosexual men aren't attracted to heterosexual men, they're attracted to any women. the split is on gender lines, not sexual orientation lines.",™

t5_2s30g,DownhillYardSale,1357091234,"My buddy's birthday party. I only know him. We show up at a bar and I get to meet a lot of fascinating people.  This vivacious blond with the curliest hair I have ever seen seems to be distraught over something. Naturally I ask why because I have a bleeding heart for anyone in pain - the party she is throwing had a DJ cancel. I don't think into it too much and am well on my way to drunk by this point.  She's constantly scanning her phone as we pick up to the next bar. I ask her at random intervals if she had ever found anyone and how the plans were going. She has to leave the second bar to setup the afterparty. I can tell by her puppy eyes she wants company but nobody goes. I hope for the best and we'll meet up with her later.  We get to the afterparty. There's a lot of alcohol and drugs going on at this party. At some point there's a guy outside in the covered area sitting on his butt with his arms around his knees and his forehead resting on his forearms. I know that pose - you never want to see that at a party. I didn't do anything at first because I thought maybe he was just resting.  My buddy and I start talking to the guy at some point and it turns out he was FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED up and not in a good way. He was confused, nauseous and feeling like shit. I grab Vivacious Blond® to ask her how she wants to handle this. She's freaking out because she's responsible for the party and it turns out this the DJ she grabbed in a pinch to play...  ... so his buddy stays behind to cover the music while my friend and I scoop up the sickly entertainer. We put his arms around our shoulders and take him to her car. We drive him to her house... pull him in. He's fucked up beyond belief but at least coherent. My paternal instincts are firing because I don't want to see him in any more pain [and having been drugged/raped myself I wanted to see to it that he was OK]. I get him onto the couch and he says he's going to puke.  Since we had just gotten in and the others were settling in I was the only one near him and I was in a complete stranger's house. I didn't want to see her wooden floors get messed by the vomitus. She was kind enough to house him so I wanted to show my appreciation for that [to protect her also] so without thinking I took my shirt off, put my hand on his back and held my shirt out so he could throw up in it.  She gives me her shirt [this small pink deal]. I still have her shirt but she moved the next week. My shirt is gone but that's a small price to pay to see someone victimized come out of the situation intact.",®

t5_2qj8f,amikefox,1357145431,"http://www.cell.com/neuron/retrieve/pii/S0896627304006129  Maybe the bloggers phrasing is simplistic but it's overall accurate to what the study found   Abstract of the study:  "" Coca-Cola® (Coke®) and Pepsi® are nearly identical in chemical composition, yet humans routinely display strong subjective preferences for one or the other. This simple observation raises the important question of how cultural messages combine with content to shape our perceptions; even to the point of modifying behavioral preferences for a primary reward like a sugared drink. We delivered Coke and Pepsi to human subjects in behavioral taste tests and also in passive experiments carried out during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two conditions were examined: (1) anonymous delivery of Coke and Pepsi and (2) brand-cued delivery of Coke and Pepsi. For the anonymous task, we report a consistent neural response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that correlated with subjects' behavioral preferences for these beverages. In the brand-cued experiment, brand knowledge for one of the drinks had a dramatic influence on expressed behavioral preferences and on the measured brain responses.""  Edit: I should have linked the full study itself, it discusses the interpretation of the fmri data but essentially they just comp http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0896627304006129/1-s2.0-S0896627304006129-main.pdf?_tid=af6dc844-54fc-11e2-a9cd-00000aacb362&amp;acdnat=1357145682_29fab2031a93cb1642ba77cb387b6978   Anyway, you of course don't have to accept it but it's from a respected university, by reputable scientists and most importantly has been widely published in various journals and has been widely cited as reference in other studies utilizing fMRIs",®

Bolded the parts I founded interesting  [Abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920942) &gt;OBJECTIVE: &gt;**Only eight cases of cerebral myiasis in humans have been reported worldwide and only one in the United States**. Presented here is a case of cerebral myiasis in the setting of head trauma in suburban Los Angeles.   &gt;METHODS: &gt;The article includes chart review and description of a clinical case presentation.   &gt;RESULTS: &gt;A 42-year-old HIV-positive man was found in a ditch after 2 weeks, the victim of apparent assault. He had multiple facial fractures along with open depressed bifrontal sinus fractures with necrotic bone, eroded dura, exposed cortex, **and extensive maggot infestation of the left frontal lobe**.   &gt;The patient was taken urgently to the operating room, where the **maggots where evacuated by irrigation and suction**. Debridement of necrotic bone, dura, and brain was performed, the frontal sinuses were exenterated, and skull defects plated with titanium mesh. Intraoperative cultures revealed a polymicrobial meningitis/encephalitis, which was treated postoperatively with antibiotics.   &gt;**The patient's** neurologic exam stabilized and the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further care, **ultimately achieving functionality and holding a job**.   &gt;CONCLUSION: &gt;This is the first published case of cerebral myiasis secondary to trauma, and to our knowledge, the first documented long-term survivor of extensive cerebral myiasis. Wide debridement to normal brain followed by 6 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is effective in managing this condition. A well-functioning outcome can be expected with prompt recognition and treatment of the disease. Larval infestation may have a protective effect against bacterial infection and may allow for greater tolerance of treatment delay.   &gt;Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",©

[Link](http://freeviewnz.tv/help-support/faqs.aspx)  &gt;Freeview Satellite® provides crystal clear digital quality pictures and sound in Standard Definition.

EDIT: Buy one with a DVB-T (Terrestrial) tuner, and use your UHF antenna, it will give you much better picture quality.

t5_2rct2,TalkingToCusco,1357184180,"I had no problem dating people with religious beliefs! haha. They're usually OK if they're willing to date outside their belief system. Their willingness is an agreement of mutual respect and boundaries. As far as anyone should be concerned, religion is between an individual and their god, or gods.   --HAHA!! If he gets uppity about his religion you could rock his religion by having him ethically justify the story of:  ✝Abram, Sari, and Hagar. (rape of slave)  ✞Abraham &amp; Isaac. (human sacrifice)  ✠Job, Satan, &amp; God. (gambling, murder, robbery, and bioterror)  Etc. The scripture is littered with immense ethically challenging teachings.  I have no idea how I was ever indoctrinated into it as a small child. Nothing but confrontation, menacing, enforced conformity, indiscriminate hostility, alienation, abandonment, isolation, casual brutality, abuse, apathy, and prejudice did I ever experience from religious culture. A very ""us verse them"" thing. A few good ones though. The more it hurt me the more I held to it. I maxed out the AWANAs program, and did the church thing. Biggest waste of time, ever. The best thing to have ever happened to me was quitting god. It was immeasurably liberating! Be patient with religious folk, it's not like they mean to be at odds with the world. It's a lifestyle more than a religion for many. Anything else would disturb their sense of rightness and justice. Like any comfort zone, it's hard to be aware of and it's harder to get out of.   I can best describe it as having an epiphany after the convergence of independent thinking and experience harmonizing in disgusted for morally compromising revelations causing such extreme apprehension that an identity crisis with an urgency that's like being on fire spontaneously ignites while running in circles with complete indecision about what to do about having been so invested in nothing and the new horror of having uncertainty about my emerging new identity, and feeling guilty about it and fearing community rejection. It's freaking scary to discover the world doesn't remotely resemble what you though it did, but then there is the joy and celebration of comprehending how wonderful the world actually is!   In my experience religion empowers people that twist their minds to believe God is on their side while rationalizing away the depravity of their opinions, and worse yet -their actions. It's best to be very cautious of the devoutly religious. Not all the religious folk share the ""Dog-eat-dog"" mentality of the conservatives, it's a mixed bag of liberal and conservative thinkers. I found liberal religious people to be much more easy going and accepting. It seems being conservative and religious greatly exaggerates the mentality of ""dog-eat-dog"".   Losing faith is a very intense roller coaster. It also takes a great deal of emotional and intellectual maturity to make this flying leap. ",✝

t5_2qh9a,ThePerdmeister,1357189102,"It seems I'm dealing with Ayn Rand here. I should have ended this conversation before it started.  I understand the appeal of ""fuck society"" mentalities, but you do realize that you depend upon society for nearly every pleasure and comfort you've ever experienced, right? We live in a welfare state, and when I say we should be accountable to a broader society, I mean we should be accountable to our neighbours, to our families and friends, to people we don't even know, simply because it's virtuous to minimize suffering when possible, and simply because we depend on these people for the very infrastructure upon which we each rely. People existing in a society will always have a societal obligation, because without society, the individual is helpless; none of us can feed, shelter, clothe, or educate ourselves alone. You can say ""fuck society"" all you like, but your attitudes and opinions didn't spring up internally; they sprung up through the individual/societal dialectic. The very language you think in is the result of your societal thrown-ness. Being a member of a society requires a measure of conformity, but, and this is where you've placed words in my mouth, I never claimed that being a citizen is to wholly accept legislation or mass opinion.  Don't get me wrong, I think revolution must always be at the back of our minds; I never once implied that blind conformity is necessary (and the individual/societal dialectic is not a simply acquiescence to social norms, it's just a process by which the individual gains autonomy). I don't understand how you've made the leap from, ""I think racist, sexist, and homophobic hate speech should be illegal,"" to ""I think everyone should act exactly the same and should never even imagine disagreeing with the State.""  &gt;You have every right to be offended, or threatened. You should not have the right to restrict which sounds or thoughts a person expresses  Now here, I think it's important to realize that people are often threatened into silence, or threatened into private spaces. If a person's unabated free speech has the potential to limit another person's speech, who do we defend? The antagonist or the victim?  &gt;Why don't you just admit that you are opposed to liberty and freedom? You've already done it, but why not just come out and say that you are an authoritarianism? Why don't you come out of them PC closet and own it?  You sound like a propagandist here. Yes, I wholly oppose liberty and freedom, and, in fact, I'm a communist, or a terrorist, or whatever group-de-jour is supposedly limiting the abstract concept of All-American Freedom™. I'm for political correctness only because I remember a time when it didn't exist, and I can see that a sort of formal linguistic attempt to lessen social discrimination is better than whatever we had before. Is it perfect? No. Is it working to the advantage of those groups of people who are regularly oppressed legally and customarily? Yes.   &gt;Nobody should be obligated to do anything they do not want to do.  Congratulations; you sound like a ten year old.",™

Plan B One-Step® works in a similar way to help prevent pregnancy from happening. It works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary. It is possible that Plan B One-Step® may also work by preventing fertilization of an egg (the uniting of the sperm with the egg) or by preventing attachment (implantation) to the uterus (womb).  and for your second question:  &gt; Plan B One-Step® should only be taken in emergencies (when your primary birth control method failed or you forgot to use birth control), but there is no medical reason why you can't take it more than once. Don't be afraid to take Plan B One-Step® when you need to, but remember that it should never replace routine methods of contraception, as it simply isn't as effective.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1357192212,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

I try not to watermark, but I do like to have the metadata with the copyright field in the IPCT copyright field to have the right date in it.    Watermarking is a bit controversial in the photography field, or at least, the amateur and advanced amateur areas that I run with.  There are two distinct fields of thought:  **Pro Watermarking**  * ""If I don't then clients will steal from me and post without credit"" * ""It brings me business"" * ""How else will people know it's you"" * ""It builds my brand""  **Against Watermarking**  * ""People that will steal your image aren't going to be clients anyway"" * ""Big obnoxious watermarks are obnoxious and attention whoring"" * ""Let your images be your 'brand' not your watermark""  Case in point is Trey Ratcliff (the guy at [Stuck in Customs](http://stuckincustoms.com) who gives away all his images in high resolution (as in, native, or close to it) and completely unwatermarked.  His philosophy (and it seems to be working based on his success) is that you get more by sharing your images, and when people who aren't going to just ""steal"" them to put on their desktop or put in a blog post see them (ie: corporate bigwigs with deep pockets) they pay, but you don't get into their sights (pun intended) without having your work out there as much as possible.  Trey has a fairly distinctive style (he's the HDR guy), so it's ""easy"" to see what images are his when you're trolling around, which helps the brand.  Part of this though is that he's good at what he does and he's got a focus on his goals.  Joe photographer who shoots landscapes, and kittens, and macro, and family portraits, and babies, and.... probably doesn't have enough style or recognition to garner anyone ""knowing"" who they are, so they compensate with huge ass watermarks across the bottom third of their image and postings with (and this is from my own photographic circle): ""All images © John Doe Photography DO NOT REMOVE WATERMARK OR CROP IMAGE"".  I fall somewhere in the middle.  I have a logo and a (IMHO) subtle and small watermark that I put in the corner of the larger posted images, and the full size images I give out from TFP shoots.  I haven't developed a ""style"" of my own yet (at least as far as I can tell), so it is nice to think that someone will see a shot of mine, google the logo text and wheel a pile of money to the door to have me shoot them.  Realistically though it's not going to happen.  I really need to just make a decision :)   Sorry for the long diatribe! ",©

t5_2r1ox,soshix21,1357209153,"Part 3 of 4:  -------------  If you listen to the song through and through, also note that the rhythm stays somewhat consistently with who is talking where. The more upbeat “140” part with the synth sounds often represent the main character (G1). In fact after 2:30ish, you rarely hear the external personas. In fact, that might be purposeful because once she actually enters the relationship, she is more concerned about how the guy thinks of here and less what her friends care for. The only time you hear the “external” persona is at 3:38 (the Fany and Tae power vocal part) harking back to the beat and rhythm of 1:44. In a sense, this can be seen as the once-external thoughts being internalized by G1 until she can overcome it (and brings it back to 140).   Therefore, in a sense, there are three different layers to this song. You have the real world (Where G1, G2, and G3 initially talk), G1’s relationship and self-thoughts (Much of the verses), and G1’s Internal struggles (Fany/Tae’s power vocals). In essence, the girl finds the most stability right in the middle.    Looking at the choreo (just the relationship between members stances often is the biggest stage factor) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkk0wgmcsY0&amp;t=0m50s  Few points:  * The first opening stance is important. It was leaked before the actual release and shows the girls in a stereotypical gossipy/school pose. * Note how G2 and G3 often have their own 3-member subunits as dissenting voices. G1 though is usually 1 voice. C1 is everyone together. * There is a clear dialogue between Hyo ad Yoona at 3:07 (of different opinions about showing their bare-face and completely trusting) * When Fany sings at 3:36, people are observing and reacting to her “justifications.” (I already talked about what happens during Seo’s part) * I LOVE the imagery of 4:02 with Fany’s solo part. It reminds me of the harsh lighting and spotlight in Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody.  * There are few hand gestures throughout the choreo that I suspect will be the hardest to replicate.  * All-in-all this is a very Western dance with MANY moving points and focused individual parts. When some of the girls sing (such as Tae, Sunny, and Yoona) the attention is fully on them and the other 8 girls are either setting up for the next formation, or following the lead singer. In doing so, this is often somewhat rare in KPop formations and a lot of JPop choreo, as well.   In the end, I earnestly believe that this song somewhat transcends normal KPop boundaries. However, the medium (Hip Hop) they used didn't help them, nor did the frantic and jarring MV (I've said this before, and I'll say it again, after you watch and read the Eng Subbed version of the MV; try to just listen to the CD version of the song. It isn't *as* bad as when you watch it. Why? Because your ears don't follow your eyes. Your eyes see a ton of imagery, colors, and moving/shifting sets and outfits. The transitions seem that much more in stone and contrasting. Without the MV, the song seems to flow like a story, with different voices.)  Do you need to completely understand the Korean language and lyrics? No. Not at all for this song actually. In fact, though I consider myself at a fairly high level of understanding for Korean, to be able to “get” the song in two languages is actually helping me appreciate this song even more. But, there is a certain “unf” that are lost when you read translations (see: The Boys). For that, some of the pathos of the song is lost on the Western viewer. But, this contrast is not so great that you can’t appreciate the song and its musicality.   Lastly, the two biggest comparisons I’ve heard (and I also say) are comparing this to a short musical and/or Bohemian Rhapsody. The musical part can be seen with the distinct characters and scenes. In the short succession of parts, you see a direct (albeit fast) maturation of the main character. Furthermore, the MV allows the viewer to literally discern the different settings. In terms of the Queen reference: BR is one of the great masterpieces of music lore. I am NOT saying this is anything close to that. However, it does have some similarities (long vocal part, catchy fast parts, etc). Each of these sections don’t necessarily flow together easily in a minute view, but looking at it on a macro level allows the viewer to see a stitched together piece that works well ALL together. In fact, until you can appreciate many of the things I’ve said here, you won’t begin to see why this song could be revolutionary. It grows on you. Each time you listen you notice slight difference and things you missed. And this, I personally believe, differentiates good songs from great ones. It forces you to think and it isn’t ashamed to make you do so.  Like I said (and my posting history can reflect it), I did not like this song at all the first time.

t5_2s7k2,JasonMacker,1357217151,"I'm sorry but I have to wholeheartedly disagree with this article's premises and conclusions.  First of all, the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century was NOT actually the Really Big Deal™ you're making it out to be.  You talk about Imams today arguing over trivialities, and I agree, *that* is what the Protestant Reformation was about.  However, theological bickering has always existed. If you look at the history of Christendom it's a history of persecution and ""correcting"" people for going off into the deep end. But of course, history is written by the victors, so all the ancient theological quibbles are basically taken for granted. How many people are [Gnostics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Gnosticism) today? Basically none, even though there's nothing inherently ""strange"" about Gnostic Christianity, only that they were persecuted for being heterodox.  The only difference between the Arianists, non-trinitarians, etc. and the Lutherans was the development of the printing press and being able to disseminate their ideas much more widely. There is absolutely nothing intrinsic about Lutheranism that somehow makes it more theologically malleable or ""liberal"" or whatever, any more than the rest of the heretics throughout history.  The Church was no longer able to have a stranglehold on divergence of opinions, this is true. However, the divergence of opinion *was* not the sign of religious **tolerance**. The Protestants were just as intolerant as the Catholics were, and Protestant-dominated areas persecuted Catholics (and vice-versa).  One thing that DID happen however, was something that did not happen before in history. This was the [Enlightenment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), [Modernity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity), [the Industrial Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_revolution) and [Radicalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_radicalism). These were people that were completely disgusted and alienated by this theological bickering, that simply **did not make sense in light of all the things going on around them**.  People looked at the theological bickering and said ""it's complete bullshit, and it's worst than that, **you are wasting our time**. We need to be talking about things that are relevant to our society, such as the advancement of medicine, technology, engineering, and social structures"".  Keep in mind that prior to the 19th century that ALL of Europe was subordinate to a bunch of monarchs who claimed *divine right* and said that they were ruling in the name of God. But then something happened that destroyed this illusion forever:   **[King Louis XVI had his head chopped off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution)**.  This was a King that was supposedly divinely ruling his subjects, and was ordained by God, and protected by the Holy Spirit, and his head was no longer connected to his body. And even worse, **nobody took his place**. Nobody claimed to be King of France in his stead. Instead, France became something that was very strange relative to all the nations around it: A ""Republic"", where the common man became their own rulers.  To the French people (and others who were watching) of the time, this was the equivalent of Mecca being nuked. This sent chills down the spines of every monarch who heard about it. They realized they were mortal, and not in fact ""divinely guided by God"". And after them, the commoners *also* heard about it. And they thought to themselves ""wait a second, if France can work despite not having a King, then maybe *we* also don't need a King as well!""  And that's when [this caricuture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Cruikshank_-_The_Radical%27s_Arms.png) came about. Notice the banners at the top: ""No God, No Religion, No King, No Constitution"". Notice the bottom where they are stepping on things labeled ""The Law"", ""Virtue"", ""Magna Carta"", ""Rights"", and a book (the Bible). If you ever wondered where the propaganda of atheists being immoral, drunks, ugly, bloodthirsty, disgusting, petty, unsuccessful, etc. came from, you're looking right at it. This propaganda was so strong that it's still alive today.  And *this* is what the Muslim world has faced and is facing: the rise of radicalism; people who want to radically change society. The radicals are two camps: left and right. Keep in mind however that ""radical"" has historically meant only those on the Left. You can look at the modern history of the Muslim world and you'll see this too. It's a very vast subject so I can't cover it all. But basically, the Enlightenment didn't hit the Muslim world the way it did the Christian world, for several reasons:  The Muslim rulers in general didn't give a shit about what was happening in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were too busy keeping their subjects in line. And the [radical writings being spread around in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen) weren't being translated into Arabic or Persian. And the Europeans who *did* come to the middle east were not the radicals. After all, travel was very expensive back then and so the people who did end up going to the middle east were the monarchists and conservatives. ""Oh, you have a King in Persia? We have a King in England as well! The natural order is monarchy/feudalism."" And it was in their interest to suppress any radicalism in the middle east, because they were getting good deals from Colonialism and Imperialism.  The other thing was that as soon as the [French Republic was declared, it came under attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_19th_century#French_Revolution_.281789.E2.80.931792.29). By all the monarchies around it. It was a sort of policy of containment, similar to the Cold War. The French simply didn't have the time to spread their ideas to the middle east, they were too busy fending for themselves.  I simply can't cover all of this information.  But basically, ALL OF THIS information, this *actual* history of the west, is being spread to the middle east right now. This stuff is getting translated and being disseminated. Basically, all the bullshit that the imperialists spewed about how they were the nobles and how life was great and they were all happy and living together, the Muslims had taken for granted. They simply didn't know that it was all bullshit.  (cont.'d)",™

Granted, there is a piece of me which wants to go back and see if my home built antenna would work for both.  Then there is the larger piece of me which says, ""fuck it, it works, leave it alone.""  Stooping in the attic is murder on my back.   If you get the desire to try again, I definitely suggest building a bowtie and trying it.  My total cost was around $20 for washers, the transformer, and the spliter-joiner.  Though, I had the wood, screws, brackets and wire sitting about from previous projects.  Also, I can't stress enough the difference a reflector made.  Just my body behind the antenna boosted the signal significantly, the 40""x36"" reflector I built was almost like magic.  And, it's just aluminum foil on cardboard with wood supports; as I titled it in the pics: the Real Redneck Reflecktor©.

t5_2r4cj,GeForce,1357224897,"*TL;DR Spoilers. I'm going to answer this question with a lot of weaknesses in Ibuki. This DOES NOT mean that I think lowly or poor of her. In fact, I could name two pluses for every minus I listed. BUT, the fundamental problem STANDS. Read if you want to find out about it.*  **Akuma is a jack of all trades. I always said Akuma was a combination of ryus zoning and ibuki's vortex.**  Two biggest problems boiled down are:  * No DP, No health, Slow backdash. You will DIE if you are on defense.  * She has NO way to zone properly. No footsies*, no fireballs.   And some minor ones.  * Ibuki jump arc makes her easy to anti air; if it's ambiguous jump - it's always going to crossup. * Walk speed is one of the slowest in the game. That is a big deal for offense, look at cammy for reference.  Ryu could zone even if he didn't have a fireball. He just has those universal normals. Ibuki doesn't.  * stMK is fine, but on whiff it's totally not safe.  * stMP is nice, but it's nothing to write about when you play vs characters like bison who has literally double the reach  * crHK is really nice on paper, but in my experience always gets beaten out by opponents pokes/roundhouse as it has almost no active frames.  * tsumuji is only safe on block! Gets beaten out by a lot of stuff, builds next to no meter, and pushes her back quite a bit, which is not the best thing for a rushdown character.  * crMP is too slow, it's mainly used as a baited option select.  * crLK is 1 frame to everything. crLP is 4frames, while it could be worse, it's no balrog.  * overhead is 26 startup frames! 26 frames! I'll just leave it at that.  * kunai get beaten out by anything. Literally, a jab will beat it.  **Her offense isn't that insane if you know what to look for**. I can't stress this enough. I.e. I'm not fearful of mirror matchups because I can see everything coming a mile away..  * I know how to escape every single ""vortex"" or mixup she has.  * Her overhead is very slow [while there is a special normal to cancel into overhead, you see it miles away, easy to punish on reaction]  * Command dashes are all negative.  * And I already talked about her jump arcs.   Did i mention everything off of her short is a 1 frame? While we're at it, I should tell you that everything Ibuki does ever is 1frame. I won't even list this as a negative point, because I find extreme pleasure from this. But I felt like it should be reflected here.  So really - I'm just not afraid, the only thing I might be afraid of is online latency. lol  What we end up is almost a gimmicky character with a better than average footsies, no better ""vortexability"" than i.e. cammy (who hits like a truck and has footsies twice as good as ibuki). Or akuma, who doesn't even need to get in to win games. He can ZONE, play Ok footsies, and once he gets KD he goes for vortex.  **Ibuki doesn't have the luxury to zone.** She's like sakura, but doesn't hit even half as hard. Or Akuma with no DP and no fireballs or teleport. Now, just try to imagine for a second. Akuma with no fireballs or DP. I'll let you do this for a second. Still here? Ok. Now, tell me. It wasn't easy was it?  **She's not only an overwhelming character to play against, but also to play as.** Not only because she has this insane level of execution and technicality that is needed, but also because she does have a lot of options that can really BSOD your brain.. and I mean it, she is like a DDOS for the user himself, just has insane amount of depth in her, like a chest of pandora, it will overwhelm you if you are not careful. *But it is all for one and one purpose only - GET IN, AND SCORE A KNOCKDOWN.*  **If she was any better, she'd be op.** (and if your opponent has low matchup knowledge, then he's silly free),  BUT. At the highest of high levels, she just crumbles due to her nature of a gimmicky mixupy character.   Sako is a God, but even he seems to hit that limit. I don't know how easy it is to see this for non ibuki players, but I just see some matchup flaws that are almost insurmountable. While I do still believe that someone like Sako, a true God in my eyes, I have only the upmost respect to him, could win anything - it would just then come down to simply outplaying the opponent to the level that the character doesn't even matter.  Of course. To every point I have, I can list a counterpoint that is just if not more valid i.e. for someone with one of the worst dp in the game (5frame startup, no invincibility) - she has one of the best anti airs imaginable.  But it's no easy task to use them. If ryu could almost win evo with 2 or 3 normals, then Ibuki needs to be more like a super computer, the similar kind that GenPlayer.exe runs his footsies plugin; just have to be really smart about the way she uses her normals. While her B+MP is godlike, I wont even attempt to lie about that, it's not perfect. Nor hitbox wise, nor damage. i.e. that on its own, with no juggle combos - is nothing. I could jump on that 5 times in a row and won't feel a thing.  **And in The End none of this even matters. I love her the way she is ! ♥**  She is the girl I fell in love with. My life wouldn't be the same without her. It made me love fighting games. It made me into who I am today. It wasn't an easy road, but I'd gladly go along it all over again.  If they changed even a single frame of anything - I'd probably go set a kitten on fire. I swear, I would!  P.S. If you disagree and think she's op - I'll give you a personal lesson on how to destroy Ibuki. Trust me, I know that part. Or, I could do the opposite [While I can't claim ""The best Ibuki of EU"" I certainly ain't new to this thing.](http://www.youtube.com/user/GFClocked?feature=mhee)  P.S.S. I'd love to get some thoughts from people like Izuna, Mingo as they are the ones I respect the most, other than, of course, the God himself.

t5_2rfpj,syriquez,1357252723,"1. The devs have already talked about this and are considering it. (Though they'd need to fix the bug that's going on right now where multiple rounds on a single map run cause Power Nodes to stay on the map.) 2. No, for the hundredth time. Providing mobile defense is part of the game for Marines. It has been since NS1. The rest of the tripe you've posted in this pile are advantages the Marines don't need. (And the devs have already been working on making the maps more ""alive""--did you not see the difference between Refinery in Build 233 versus Build 234/235, particularly in Smelting?). 3. You do realize Batteries have less health than Nodes, right? A *fuckton* less health? 3 of them would be easier for a Gorge to kill than a single Node. You're talking 1800/600 total for 3 Batteries versus 2000/1000 for the Node. And on top of that, you make it easier for the Gorge to pick key structures to disable. Marines would have to stack the shit out of Arms Labs everywhere because of how easy it would be to disable them. 4. Placed AI weaponry is not a defense, it is a deterrent. Bad NS2 players don't seem to understand this. 5. ...What game have you been playing? Nearly every map has this already, unless you're talking some bizarre burrowing power for the Aliens. Just go look at the hallways between Sub-Sector and Flight Control on Summit. There's fucking crevices and vents and floor holes *everywhere* for the Aliens to use. 6. This fucking subreddit... I've said I wouldn't get into balance discussions anymore but this is just stupid.   1. Camo is only threatening if you're a bad player with a bad Commander. Marines don't need thermal vision that completely disables it.   2. This upgrade would be entirely pointless and unnecessary. ""Excuse me, Comm? I'm going to make myself totally useless to the team for 5 minutes until a Skulk rapes me for being an idiot.""   3. NS1 already had Grenades. I honestly have no idea if the devs have considered bringing them back or not. Marines don't really need more damage (and for the most part, Grenades were useless until they were changed to have 3 per life rather than just 1).   4. Marines already deal a ridiculously high amount of DPS. They don't need an easy mode weapon that's more powerful than fucking Stomp and completely eliminates the hurdle to Marine success: The ability to aim. 7. Because res-for-kills horribly breaks the game. It worked in NS1 because Marines *only* had team resources and Aliens *only* had personal resources (though it didn't work once the skills levels got too high...because you could tech up by having Marines just camp an area getting res for the Commander, or you would have a Fade in 45 seconds and the game would be done in 2 minutes). The last time I played the Voogru servers, they had a hidden mod that gave Skulks res-for-kills. In 45 seconds, I had enough PRes to go Fade and I completely dominated the map after that point. It was a throwback to an earlier time and it made me laugh at how unbalanced it is in NS2. 8. The skin choices are already more than enough. Also, AAA game? Really? *Really?* 9. Excuse me while I autofellate over my kill count. That said, it'd be handy to use as a tool for me to say ""Piss off you idiot, I actually know what I'm doing"" when threads like this pop up. That said, I really don't have an opinion on this because I don't care about it. 10. Still don't care. 11. Rookie mode needs to be locked for the first 20 hours of game time. 12. Matchmaking sucks. But yes, the game desperately needs a ""view server info"" from the browser. It's silly that I have to use a workaround via Steam Friends to view the info. 13. Babblers. *Soon™.* 14. It's more Jetpack vs. Onos but Exos pop up because bad Marines are bad. That's how the game goes. You tech up and rely on that tech. 15. Alien structures generally cost more, are highly vulnerable to surgical strikes (an Arms Lab that is destroyed doesn't eliminate research into Weapons 3...but a new Shell has to research Carapace again), take time to reach full health (which is significantly lower than that of equivalent Marine structures, usually--the Harvester maxes out at 1750/500 versus the Extractor at 4000/500...or 2000/1000 for the Node), and can be destroyed from another room by a weapon the Aliens don't have: a wall-piercing siege tank. As for the second paragraph... MARINES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER? NERF ALIENS NERF ALIENS NERF ALIENS OMGOMGOMG. Bad Marines will be bad. 16. No. Marines don't need more incentive to turtle and Exos already exist. 17. That's a lot of voice work. It's also not necessary. Players that aren't interested in reading the stuff that pops up on their screen will be back to WoW and CS 1.6 in a week anyway.  ---  Bug list:  1. Yeah, this is kind of irritating but it speeds up choosing upgrades as well, since it means you don't have to click inside another menu to, say, research Phase Gates. I'd like the icon ""hitboxes"" to be a little smaller. 2. Eh. Just need to do something like hit Q-A-V and you're good. 3. Eh. 4. ARCs are already strong enough and Scan already lasts *far* too long and is *far* too large given the nerfs to Shades. It also doesn't help that Ink doesn't work right now. 5. No. It's part of the skill. *I don't miss my resupply drops when Commanding.* You need to learn how to do so. 6. Known bug. 7. Marine structures use magic nanites to construct everything. Structure size is irrelevant. 8. English?  ---  Features list:  1. I do not disagree with this (though it'd get kind of stupid if you were to join, say, the new 32 player server...though you're an idiot if you join that in the first place). The lack of being able to assign squads is part of the issue. 2. Scoreboard. As for knowing structure health/etc., your Marines should be telling you. 3. Fuck no. This is possibly the second dumbest thing you have in that entire post. 4. Because you can scout with them. It would not be fair if Marines had that power for free when Aliens have nothing equivalent. It's also to discourage spamming structure placements to distract in fights. 5. I do not disagree with this. The alert function is a little annoying because *every* alert is tied to my space bar, which includes annoying shit like a Marine requesting Ammo in base. 6. No.  *EDIT* I want to expand on why #6 is just ""No.""  The LMG takes 5 seconds to fire and reload a magazine (3 seconds plus 2 to reload), dealing between 500 and 650 Normal damage total. Against a Carapace Onos, this means you need between 6.2 [31 seconds for one Marine--and it's also impossible for the LMG Marine to solo the Onos without an ammo drop] and 4.8 [24s--this is the first point a Marine can solo the Onos with just the LMG] magazines to kill it. Change that to 70 bullets (changing firing time to 4.2 seconds for 6.2 total to fire and reload) and you reduce the magazine progression to 4.4 [27.3s--the Marine can already solo an Onos and it takes almost the same time as just Weapons 3] -&gt; 4.1 [25.4s] -&gt; 3.7 [22.9s] -&gt; 3.4 [21.1s]. This progression would make it a superior upgrade to Weapons 1, 2, *and* 3 against the Onos. The main reason Weapons 3 is so vital in this game is *because* of the Carapace Onos and your proposed upgrade completely trivializes it. And not only that, it would take only half the team ammo to kill a single Onos. Your whole team with Weapons 3+Ammo LMGs could kill TWO Carapace Onos *and have ammo to spare!*",™

There's just one problem: There's a small, really small chance of an infection that may lead to a difficult in getting pregnant in the future. That's why most gynecologists are unease in placing a IUD in a girl without kids. If you, however, fit the counter-indications for combined hormone pills, transdermal patch or hormone injections than a IUD can be considered.  Be sure you tried all other alternatives. I mean ALL.

As the more shrill those think-tanks in Washington get, the more it shows they are losing. So, though I down voted this post and comment, expect a net increase in your karma as I could not help myself from upboating some of your stuff.   Say, did you know that **Assad was an ophthalmologist in England** when he was forced to become the head of Syria by mutual consent of the Syrian people? It was like Syria said ""we need a volunteer"" and the whole nation took one step back, leaving Assad one step forward.     (source: http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/12/08/barbara-walters-calls-syrian-dictator-a-mild-mannered-ophthalmologist/)  *(You can't make this stuff up! ℒອℒ)*  Admittedly he has not made reforms as fast as I would like. but I defer to the people of Syria who would reelect him in a heart-beat. He is the one who brought the internet to Syria, and few things are better for any people than a sufficient amount of porno. *(And all the other things that come along with the internet.)* So while I don't back Assad because I know him, and he's giving me something. I back him because the people living in Syria back him by more than 50%, and he is fore a secular government. *(There again, his Alawite leanings are not to be desired, and what got him in to this mess in the first place.)*   It seems the FSA is saving up maybe 1/4 of all arms they get, as if they want a stockpile to do something after the war. My guess is these will be funneled back into ~~Saudi~~ Arabia. Then Yemen,...   Im wondering if this post is true?:  &gt;The textbook was issued by Garnet Education, an independent English-Language Teaching (ELT) instructor in Britain. The textbook contains a map with “Occupied Palestine” in place of Israel, according to media reports.  http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/01/01/281301/map/  If it were true, the Israeli lobby will force a reprinting and the company may recall the books. Then the company can sell the books as a collectors item and make a little from an ingenious sideline! *(If I'madinnerjacket get's sent to the UN by Iran, and he holds up one of these books before the general assembly... the crowed will go wild!)*   PS: Thanks for being such a great contributor to reddit ☺   [edit: Fix link]",☺

t5_2qh13,Ze_Carioca,1357269995,"Save Assad from his people when they storm his palace in vengence.   I am delighted to read the BS sources Assad shills post on Reddit, it shows how desperate they are since Assad is losing. Seriously a conspiracy radio station hosted by Jack Blood, that is the best you shills can do? Not even PressTV or RTnews has good news for you Assad puppets these days.   Did you know that Assad was an opthalmologist when the Alawite elites who run Syria made him dictator? There was no mutual consent because he was never voted in. He was appointed by a small circle of elites who oppress the majority of the country for their own benefit, and this is why the Syrian people are overthrowing them.   He has not made any reforms. The people went to the street demanding reform and he sent his thugs to beat them up. They stood up to his thugs, so he started having them killed. Instead of giving up the people of Syria rose up against him, and his own military defected to protect the people from him. Now that he is losing he is offering the reforms they initially wanted, but it is too late. If there was an election he would lose by a landslide. The people of Syria hate him so much they have risked everything to get rid of him.   After Assad is overthrown there will probably be a war between the FSA and the Jihadist. It could become like Somalia. That is the legacy Assad is leaving his country. Only one person can save Syria now, and that is Assad. If Assad surrounders to the FSA he may be able to preserve a secular Syria. If he continues to fight he will destroy Syria, literally it will cease to exist and it will fragment into petty fiefdoms fighting each other. Assad is a coward and wont do the right thing though.   Im not sure what this textbook has to do with Syria. The textbook will need to be reprinted though, because Syria wont exist in a year, so they will need to update their map to reflect that. I really dont care what they decide to call Israel and Palestine.   I am glad you like my contributions. I cant say I care much for yours, as you are a total shill who post false propoganda. However, I do enjoy thinking about how much it must piss you off to watch Assad slowly lose. I wonder if you believe your own BS misinformation out of ignorance or if you know it is false and are dishonest. Either way when Assad is overthrown you will be coming up with all kind of excuses on how he was winning, but some US special OPS mission took him out. I look forward to when you choke on your lies. ☺",☺

I use two approaches to cleaning cerumen:  1st - Saline cleaning with a syringe and small hose (cut IV scalp) - Some counter-indications must be considered like: ear trauma, ruptured tympanus and Diabetes Mellitus.  2nd - if saline cleaning is unable to produce results, like when a big cerumen is dry and isn't coming out, I prescribe a week of usage of 'trietanolamina' (don't know if that's allowed in you country, here we call it Cerumin®) inside the ear, three or four times a day and it will soften the cerumen and make the cleaning easier on a follow-up consultation.

t5_2qh2p,Loki5654,1357330823,"[/u/Dudesan has a pretty good take on this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15uocx/ive_discovered_that_atheists_often_have_troubles/c7q5osc)  &gt;I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they are.  &gt;Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  &gt;Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  &gt;Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  &gt;(Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  &gt;Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  &gt;Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;&gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said: Honor your father and your mother; and, The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.  &gt;&gt;But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”— he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:  &gt;&gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  &gt;(Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)  &gt;Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;&gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  &gt;(Luke 16:17, NIV)  &gt;Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt;&gt;If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.  &gt;(James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;&gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  &gt;(2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;&gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  &gt;(Romans 3:31)  &gt;&gt;Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  &gt;(2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  &gt;Well, shit.  &gt;This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",™

t5_2rd5y,RanShaw,1357339346,"Straight from Duden Universalwörterbuch:  Flag|ge ,  die; -, -n [aus dem Niederd. &lt; engl. flag, wahrsch. verw. mit aisl. flogra = flattern (verw. mit flackern)]: an einer Leine befestigte Fahne als Hoheits- od. Ehrenzeichen eines Staates, als Erkennungszeichen u. Verständigungsmittel [im Seewesen für Schiffe], die an einem Flaggenmast, -stock o. Ä. gehisst od. befestigt wird: eine F. aufziehen; die F. setzen (Seemannsspr.; aufziehen); das Schiff fährt unter britischer F. (ist ins britische Schiffsregister eingetragen);    *die F. streichen (sich geschlagen geben; nach dem seemännischen Brauch, als Zeichen der Niederlage die F. einzuziehen; vgl. engl. to strike the flag): vor diesen Argumenten musste sie die F. streichen; F. zeigen (seine Meinung od. Erwartung mit Nachdruck u. deutlich zu erkennen geben; nach engl. to show the flag); unter falscher F. segeln (eine bestimmte Identität vortäuschen).  © Duden - Deutsches Universalwörterbuch, 6. Aufl. Mannheim 2006 [CD-ROM].  .  So in short: Flagge is used in special contexts, such as celebrations or naval contexts.  The reason why it has been borrowed into German probably has to do with the Hanseatic League, which was founded in Lübeck, Northern Germany, in the 13th century. The Hanseatic League was a confederation of merchant guilds, which eventually encompassed Germany, the Netherlands and Flanders, and many coastal cities along the Baltic coast, including areas in Danemark and Sweden, and stretching all the way up to Estonia. Their main means of trade and transportation were, naturally, ships. The overseas contact between these countries led to extensive borrowing of particular terminology regarding trade or naval terms.  So that's why the word ""Flagge"" in German was borrowed (from English, which in turn borrowed it from Scandinavian languages, like you said) to be used in particular contexts, one of which is naval terminology, alongside its original ""Fahne"".   Interestingly, the word ""flag""/""Flagge"" was also introduced in Dutch, and led to the word ""vlag"". Dutch also had an original West-Germanic equivalent, ""vaandel"", but that is hardly used anymore, and in very, very specific contexts (e.g. the flag carried in a procession).  Borrowed terms for which there is a native equivalent are usually either used in a specialised sense, or take over the primary meaning of the original equivalent, which leads to the original term being used in a specialised sense. For instance, the French borrowing 'beef' is used in a specialised sense (food), whereas the original Germanic word 'cow' remains to be used for its primary meaning (animal).  I hope that was clear. If not, please tell me and I'll try to explain it better! :) ",©

t5_2t3u0,highguy420,1357344812,"Unions are an idea whose time has come and gone.  We now can see clearly that they do not actually do what they claim, they cannot guarantee access to work.    The unions do not own the factories.  They cannot keep them open.  The board of directors can move their production overseas where there is unorganized labor and profit from the exploitation of the workers in those countries.  And the labor unions can do nothing to stop them.    The unions are also helpless against modern union-busting tactics.  The corporations can simply pull a Hostess® and reorganize, stealing the union workers' pensions as bonuses and ""closing shop"" to end all binding agreements with the labor unions.  They ""sell"" the ""assets"" of the company to a ""third party"" and six months later Hostess® Snack Cakes are back on the menu!  The non-union menu that is.  Now, this is mostly a problem with publicly-traded international corporations, but it is a model that most large companies strive to follow.  There are exceptions to the rule and those are almost always family- or employee-owned businesses that are not publicly traded.  I'm going to suggest a solution for the problem, but I want it to be clear that I am not suggesting it is the correct business model for all businesses.  There are those who are respectable on their own merits, and there are those who are not to be trusted to have the employee's, let alone the economic viability of the nation as their primary concern.  The solution to this problem is to remove the board of directors from the equation.  That may seem drastic, but remember, I'm talking about the big multinational corporations, the ones that a recent study showed an alarming amount of overlap between the boards of most of the big multinational corporations.  They are all the same people, making decisions at one company that benefits their other companies.  One giant, worldwide conflict of interest.  Instead of a board of directors, make each employee an equal share holder in the company, with equal vote in matters that affect the entire company.  The transition may take some creativity, or the formation of a new company for the purpose, but this model puts the responsibility of the company in the hands of those doing the work, with the best understanding of the job, and most importantly with no conflict of interest when it comes to their own dividends.  They simply decide, as a group, if they want more of they pay in salary, taxed and deducted as payroll, or as dividends which are taxed at capital gains rates.  Not whether they are going to take from the workers to get a bigger dividend check for themselves.    I don't know how to change the system or make it work, but unions have come and gone and didn't solve the problem.  In fact they behaved as easy scapegoats for the corporations to blame while the jobs were shipped overseas.  They may have made things worse by providing chaotic cover for the corporations to slowly move jobs instead of doing so suddenly and bearing the responsibility for destroying the economy.  We must, as a nation, realize the truth of the situation we are in and stop fighting union versus scab, black versus white, rich versus poor, blue versus read.  We, as a nation of human beings, must work to solve our problems as a group of human beings with no other goal than to right the horribly lopsided state of affairs we have now.    We can't force a change on the world, but we can start to be honest with ourselves as to the nature of our economy, and the true nature of how the corporations and unions are both consolidations of power which have been corrupted and no longer serve their intended purposes.  We need to stop supporting the corporations that are harming our economy prosperity, and start encouraging those which we see as beneficial.  ",®

t5_2qh2p,Aspel,1357345921,"The Devil in the Bible is not the Devil of Christian tradition. He also isn't the Serpent.  The Devil is a guy who's job is to test mortals and accuse them of impropriety. The Serpent is the one who gives knowledge to humanity at the cost of it's own wellbeing  **EDIT**: There's a parallel between Prometheus and the Serpent, but not between Prometheus and The Devil. The Devil is the lawyer we see in Job, not the one telling young humanity that they can be Like God.  **EDIT II: The Empire Strikes Back**: More accurately, Christian Tradition combines The Serpent and Satan, and several other minor figures such as Azazel and Lucifer into one entity that Jewish Tradition didn't have. The Biblical version of Satan and the images that spring to mind whenever a Westerner hears terms like ""Satan"", ""Lucifer"", ""Devil"" aren't as related as you'd think, though. The modern Christian Tradition's version of Satan is more a combination of other religion's demon and devil iconography, John Milton's Lucifer as a tragic figure, Aligheri's Satan as a great beast with three mouths, Folklore of Europe (some inspired by Jewish folklore) and early America (Jack o' th' Lantern the *Flying Dutchman* and the Wandering Jew, Old Scratch, *The Devil and Daniel Webster*, *Devil Went Down to Georgia*). And often a little Antisemitism.  Basically what I'm getting at is that the Devil is very unlike Prometheus. The *Serpent* has similarities, and in fact is seen as a heroic figure in Gnostic tradition (one of several better options of early Christianity deemed heretical and lost to time, unfortunate, especially considering the orgies) as well as other sects. But Satan is an accusatory figure meant to tempt, while The Devil™ is this weird combination of warden and prisoner.",™

It’s true that Corning experimented with chemically strengthened glass in 1960, as part of an initiative called “Project Muscle.” In 1961, Corning developed a glass composition it promoted under the Chemcor® brand, which featured state-of-the-art strength and durability. Chemcor glass was incorporated into tableware, ophthalmic products, and applications for the automotive, aviation, and pharmaceutical industries. When Corning began developing a tough new cover glass for electronic devices in 2006, Corning scientists, of course, drew upon the company’s prior expertise with strengthened glass. However, Corning Gorilla Glass is a different product and glass composition than Chemcor. We implemented significant compositional as well as other changes to achieve superior product characteristics including outstanding damage resistance, while making the glass compatible with Corning’s proprietary fusion-draw manufacturing process. Corning’s fusion-draw process produces exceptionally thin glass with unparalleled surface quality. The result is a tough and damage-resistant glass that is ideal for today’s sleekest electronic devices and most sophisticated touch technology.",®

t5_2qh1i,Justananomaly,1357400167," Some advice mixed in with some social engineering here for you.  - A tailor. Get one. They're really cheap and your clothes will fit and look better.  - It's been said in this thread already,  but confidence is key.  - Meet a lot of people. They don't have to be best friends with you, but you never know when their skills might come in handy, or when they might pay you for some work when you're out of a job. Make sure to always help them out within reason.  - Never lose contact with someone business related. Keep your resources up to date in case you need a reference or help.  - People will tend to like you right off the bat if you first ask an easy favor from them,  then tell them thank you and that it helped you out a lot. This is because they will immediately feel useful afterwards, and you will owe them a favor. Pay it back ASAP.   - You get better results if you dress better and give an urgent reason before asking a stranger for a favor. i.e. ""Can I cut you in line because im late for work?"" or your pregnant wife is waiting etc. as opposed to just asking if you can cut in line. Your chances with a reason given alone raise your chances dramatically, and if you have a suit on you have the authoritarian look going for you as well. Don't be a douche and do this every day, this is more for the awkward group that actually needs it. Ok, douche example, but still.  - Look like you belong. Act like you already know. My biggest lie is ""I know exactly what I'm doing"" and the first thing I do when you walk away is bust out my phone and Google sometimes.  - Fake smile. I know it's corny,  but the results you can get are amazing. Fake smiles will often turn into real smiles. You have to break the looking depressed state even if you have to force it for awhile. Think of something funny when you're frustrated at work.  - Do something/have something, at least one thing, unique that people will remember about you. For instance I make it a point to verbally list things in threes so I can list them as ""uno"", ""b"", ""and 3"" (I know, I'm a dork), because people pick up on that and remember me for saying it. Other people carry around double sided coins or always tell corny jokes or have a quick yet really awesome magic trick. Something positive like that. Just something you do or have that's fascinating to break the ice.  - Meet your goals and commitments.   - Handshakes should be firm, but not painful.   - The Nod© is appropriate if you see them after you have already shaken their hand.   Hope that helps.",©

It isn't a translation accepted by any non-JW Bible scholars that I know of.  So always use a more mainline translation and don't get caught in an argument reading from their bibles.  I recommend the New International Version® and the New Revised Standard Versions.  One of the most effective ways to help a JW is to obtain old copies of the Watchtower.  These 50+ year old publications make absolutely outlandish statements and predictions.  Because JW's largely believe in the inerrancy of these statements they can be quite effective in opening the minds of followers.  This, ultimately, was how I changed the thinking of a friend of mine.  Start here: http://www.jwfiles.com/  BTW, I actually like JWs (and Mormons) because IMHO they are far less hypocritical than many other so called believers and actually walk-the-talk and live their beliefs, being honest and moral.

Together, we can make 2013 more spectacular than the last. Skills ♥'s You.  Much love love to our STARS of POPNYE: Above &amp; Beyond, Ferry Corsten, Dash Berlin, Andy Moor, Lange, W&amp;W, Betsie Larkin, Dyloot and most importantly… YOU!       Regarding the issue with the General Admission tickets. First off, we would all like to say thank you to all who attended POPNYE and we are very sorry some of you you weren't able to make it to the floor. We did mention it on our website that the GA tickets wouldn't guarantee you access to the floor but would allow access to the lower and upper levels and we're sorry if this wasn't conveyed clearly enough to our fans. This structure was brand new to all of us - The new ticketing system was not originally intended for POPNYE and was changed due to an issue at another event held at oracle after our tickets had already been on sale for several months. In response to the change, we lowered the capacity of the general admission tickets and opened up the upper level for sale separately to ensure the lower level and floor would not be too crowded. Sectioned tickets was a response to the growth and popularity of POP as well as past safety issues that arose in our industry in 2012. Closing the floor was something that is essential to ensure the safety of everyone in the case of an emergency which is a #1 priority of Oracle Arena as well as Skills. Please remember, we do this for the safety of everyone.   All of us at Skills events met with the heads at Oracle Arena this afternoon to address all of the issues surrounding #POPNYE. We will post more after this weekend with the changes they will make for #POPTHEDREAM.   **We have split POP2013 into 3 separate levels; floor, lower level seating, and upper level seating. If we would have known that we would have to split up the levels from the beginning we would have setup Pop NYE like that as well. POP2013 Floor tickets WILL in fact have guaranteed **access to the floor unlike POPNYE - we made this change once we were aware of the new seating system with Oracle and found this to be best to ensure the maximum experience for all. We have been taking note of everyone's issues with security surrounding the wristbands and access points and will discuss with Oracle so we do not have a repeat of that at our next event. Once again we apologize for you not being able to make it to the floor and we hope you understand.",♥

t5_2tkgx,secretlyadog,1357448453,"As someone who lived in a WH for a year I became intimately, errotically, familiar with probing. For those of you who can't probe in their sleep [HERE](http://eve.aeonoftime.com/index.php/2010/06/25/reference-edenexplorers-scanning-guide/) is an excellent guide.  **SKILLS!** If there is one thing that occasionally using alts to probe has taught me it is that Astrometrics Pinpointing / Rangefinding / etc. ALL play a huge part in improving your probing returns.   **SETUP!** How you setup / manipulate your probes is what separates the ""almost got a kill"" probers from the ""how do I get all the blood off my hull"" probers.   I, myself, used a ► ► [*5 Probe Star* Setup](http://eve.aeonoftime.com/guides/beginners_guide_to_probing/shapes_big.jpg) ◄ ◄  until I realized how much SUPERIOR a 6 probe setup was for me, some of my corpmates used 7 probe setups. For ***MY*** 100% Unique Never-Seen-Before Patented *6 Probe Pentagon*™ setup you merely make a [pentagon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Pentagon.svg/220px-Pentagon.svg.png) out of 5 probes and then place the 6th one in the middle.    Then it becomes a matter of GUESSING where the signature is when you don't have a full hit, or when resizing your probes downwards.   ► If you get a red circle the size and direction of the circle will indicate which **TWO** probes are hitting (circle = two).    ► If you get a red sphere it will appear in the bubble of the probe that is hitting it.  ► If you get TWO red dots then 3 of your probes are hitting it. It is time to play process of elimination, you have a 50% chance of guessing wrong and SHAMING YOUR FAMILY.   You can move your probes using... I believe SHIFT / CTRL / or ALT and clicking on the edges of the probes or the ARROWS to move them. One of those will RESIZE all the probes and the other will RE-ALIGN (either inwards if you are homing in or outwards if you fucked up and need to size up again) all the probes. Forgive me I have been out of game since Nov 14th so I don't recall which button does which.   So, now you have 5+ probes out. Pick a shape that you find useful and setup that shape around the system. Always make sure that the probes are a nearly uniform distance from each other, as this will be important when you use CTRL (or ALT?) to auto-align them in. Why? Because sometimes you will be able to guess just from eyeballing where the red dots are which probes are not hitting it. **So Move Those Probes Right?**   ***NO!*** Don't mess up your gorgeous Pentagon / Star / Trapezoid. RESIZE the probes you feel are not hitting it (so you may end up w/ 4 2AU range and 2 4AU) until they cover nearly the whole area of the good probes. This should solve the problem.    Some probers will start at 32AU to see how many sigs there are in a system before cycling down. Our Corp Pro Prober™ starts at 4AU near the sun and works his way out. I, myself, start at 8AU around the farthest or loneliest planet and work my way in towards planet clusters / the center. This is important, you will find more sigs if you have your probes overlapping more planets so if it is a small system you can get away with starting at 4AU, and will only have to size down to 2-&gt;1-&gt;.5 before getting a 100% hit instead of my method which adds one more step (from 8 to 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; .5). When your skills are VERY high you can often get away with jumping straight from 8 to 2, but this is not 100% succesful.    If you are probing for exploration sites then time is important because you will be racing any other probers around.    If you are probing for PEOPLE then time and stealth are key. But that's a story for a different day.",™

t5_2qh1i,104372,1357450441,"English was fine ♥    tips: ""I got a PS 3 and a few games at home, come in, I will show you them!""  to  ""I've got a PS 3 and a few games at home, come in, I'll show you them!""  The ""I've"" makes it sound less awkward and the ""i will"" makes things sound incredible formal (at least to me).  #2  ""So my brother was keeping this in mind, turns around and starts running away from the car, while he was running he saw a big dustbin and jump""  to  ""So my brother, while keeping this in mind, turns around and starts running away from the car and while he was running he saw a big dustbin...""  The separation of the clause ""while keeping this in mind"" makes it a little less awkward sounding (and I believe it's incorrect grammatically anyways). The reason I swapped ""while he was running..."" to ""and while he was running"" was because with that clause in commas your sentence means: SO my brother keeping this in mind while he was running he saw a big dustbin and jumps into it and hides there..."" Doesn't make any sense. Clauses offset in commas are there to provide additional detail and the sentence should be able to be read without them. Now with the change it's ""So my brother turns around and while he was running he saw a big dustbin and jumps..."" Without the commas. Better, see?  #3  ""It's amazing that a, at that time, 12 year old boy made such brilliant decisions.""  to  ""It's amazing that, at that time, a 12 year old boy could have (or would have) made such brilliant decisions.""  Same thing as above the commas make your sentence read as ""It's amazing that a 12 year old boy made such brilliant decisions"" which is fine, but with your clause ""at that time"" makes it awkward. Though this seems sorta nit-picky even to me since all I did was move where your 'a' was in the sentence.   #4  ""I always keep in my mind, what would have happened if he got into this car..""   to  ""I'll always wonder (since I think you were trying to express an alternative situation) what would have happened if he got into this car.""   P.S. some commas are unneeded, best way to check is, as mentioned above, can you read the sentence ignoring the bits in commas? e.g. ""best way to check is can you read the sentence ignoring the bits in commas? / Some commas are unneeded as mentioned above."" is the above sentence dissected.  And things like '..' should either be an ellipsis, which is only three periods e.i. '...', which is used to either symbolize an omitted word or to show that the thought was trailing off (think old man story telling), or should end the sentence with one period.   If this tips somehow offend you or make you irritated or feel in someway negative I apologize as it was not my intention.   (Others may correct my grammar if they wish, I'm not perfect).",♥

Except it was also clear that if I wrote ""No"" my submission would be rejected.  At the same time, if I wrote ""Yes"" it would also be rejected.  Conveniently, a string of semi-random capital letters was provided in graphical text above the textbox.  It was a non-political, non-partisan solution that any 'bot would agree with.  I can only imagine the moral dilemma a human must undergo simply to make a public statement and be heard.  Well, folks that's just what we're here to change!

NortonBrowserChecker™ is still using 3/4 of the CPU time it normally does.    Norton is a good antivirus like chaining yourself to a post in a steel bunker is a good defence against getting the flu.  Anecdote time: My mother was complaining that her ancient duo core/2GB RAM was running slowly.  As in, 5 minutes to launch a browser ""slowly.""  Despite her having downloaded a half dozen ""free emoticon packs"" she didn't have any malicious spyware/malware on her PC, aside from Norton.  Removed Norton, wiped it from the registry and removed all of the references in her programs (which was not easy, attempting to use the uninstaller greeted me with ""you must upgrade to uninstall this product"" for a few of them) and swapped to the, albeit still relatively clumsy, Avast.  All of a sudden her computer can operate again!  Programs launch and process in fractions of the time! Children sing in the streets!

t5_2qhwp,biggerthancheeses,1357496331,"Average, potentially weighted movie ratings can be normalized to a scale of 0 through 100, where 0 is a 0% score and 100 is a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Creating this average requires the input of all *n* movie critics who watch the movie. Therefore, we can say that creating an average score is within the set of linear time Big O problems. Simply put, `Average = O(n)`. We need to read *all* of the reviews to create an accurate weighted average, so we need to consider a minimum of *n* reviews. Therefore, this problem is a Big Ω problem; in other words, `Average = Ω(n).` Because `Average` is `O(n)` and `Ω(n)`, it is necessary and sufficient to say that `Average` is in the class of linear time Big Θ problems, i.e. `Average = O(n) ^ Average = Ω(n) ↔ Average = Θ(n)`.  So you're right that this movie is a Big O movie, but don't forget about Big Ω and Big Θ.",↔

At some point we stop producing it (if we smoke enough) as our body thinks we already have enough. This is where it gets good: our body starts proudcing a secondary neurotransmitter called 2,4-methylenedioxyacetylcholine (MDACh) which gives us heightened senses and eventually, superhuman strength and intelligence.

t5_2qh18,lowlight,1357527861,"Nobody has tested the 840 pro for consistency AFAIK. I plan on reviewing one eventually, and until I do, I can't recommend it over the 520 yet. Because the 520 is the most consistent consumer SSD I have tested (even better than the 335 which most assume is the same except for die size) ([source](http://i.imgur.com/YcaZr.png) from an upcoming review)  Edit: This is how Intel explains how they determine MTBF. It doesn't simply mean ""this drive will usually last about this long"", and their testing standards are more strict than standard JEDEC testing. In other words, MTBF isn't *that* important to most consumers like us.  &gt; It is important to understand the qualification behind a product when assessing drive  reliability. This section provides an overview of Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF),  a widely used metric measuring SSD reliability in field application, in Intel®  Solid-State  Drives (Intel®  SSDs).   &gt; MTBF is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a system during  operation, and is usually expressed in hours.  Note that the MTBF is simply a representation of the failure rate over the life of the  drive. A particular line of SSDs with an MTBF of 1,200,000 hours does not necessarily  mean that the average SSD in that product line will last for 1,200,000 hours. **If the  MTBF is 1,200,000 hours and the drive is used an average of 8 hours per day, a  population of 1,000 SSDs would be expected to have one failure every 150 days, or  about 2 times per year.**  &gt; Intel uses Reliability Demonstration Test (RDT) as the primary method of characterizing  MTBF in Intel SSDs. During RDT, a large number of SSDs are stressed to their full  endurance specification (refer to JEDEC standard JESD218A: Solid State Drive (SSD)  Requirements and Endurance Test Method). Additionally, some failure mechanisms  which are not measured well by RDT are accounted for through supplementary tests  and actual field return data measured from similar products.  &gt; Through RDT and supplemental testing, endurance and non-endurance failures are  characterized. Endurance-related failures are caused by the repeated rewriting (or  cycling) of the NAND components used in SSDs. An endurance failure is often the  primary reliability concern of those buying SSDs, but SSDs may fail for non-endurance  reasons as well — just as motherboards and other devices containing no NAND at all  may fail. In addition, Intel SSDs often have more stringent specifications (published in  the Intel Product Specification). Intel RDT and supplementary methods require that  Intel SSDs meet not only the JESD218A requirement but also the published product  specifications; for the latter, all causes of failure are accounted for rather than just the  endurance-related ones.  &gt; Applied workload is also important in specifying MTBF. Intel qualifies their client SSDs  based on a workload consisting of 20 GB of host writes per day for a five-year period.  Under this workload, MTBF for the Intel SSD 520 Series is 1.2 million hours based on  endurance and non-endurance failures. However, under the same qualifying conditions  with a workload of 10 GB of host writes per day, MTBF for the Intel SSD 520 Series is  2.5 million hours; and for a workload of 5 GB of host writes per day, MTBF for the Intel  SSD 520 Series is 4 million hours",®

If you look at Rails code historically (and if you've worked with Rails and tried to scale it, you will have), this seems to be a rather new idea of his.  2. Whether dependency injection is supported by the language (Ruby, through duck-typing and mutable classes) or requires specific interface changes (Java), it's still dependency injection. His `Time.stub(:now)` example is doing exactly that, and he then goes on to say that that type of programming *is* a virtue. So yeah, I'm just not sure what to think, DHH.  3. I'm just going to come out and say it, and you'll have to excuse me for this: DHH isn't a particularly great developer. I'm not actually sure why we take his advice. Yes, Rails is successful, and yes, he seems to Get Stuff Done™, but having worked on a major Rails project for the last 5 years, trying to keep up with API-breaking minor updates, ridiculous bugs deep within the spaghettiest of spaghetti code, ridiculous performance issues, and worst of all, immature attitudes toward people pointing out these issues (look at the incessant drama within the Rails dev community), I can no longer justify my choice at the time to go with Rails.  Because of DHH's methodologies and even dogmas, Rails is a framework that's great for writing new web apps, but downright horrible for maintaining those apps once they've shipped. That, to me, is an irresponsible way to go about things, and while DHH is definitely not *personally* responsible for the way things are — rather, it's a certain culture — his advice fails to reflect on these huge problems, and that's why my bitterness has evolved into trust issues.",™

t5_2fwo,anvsdt,1357564371,"This was bad.  &gt;Ruby has a lot of static typing present,  It hasn't. Ruby is dynamic typed/unityped/monotyped/untyped/whatever you want to call it. It either is statically typed or it isn't.  &gt;As another option, a language may omit explicit type annotations entirely (examples: Ruby, Python). Unless such a language allows to perform every operation on every single type1, ths approach requires at least some type checks to be performed at runtime.  You can write Haskell code without ever annotating a type, without any type check. Python and Ruby omit no type annotation, they are untyped, all variables have the same type.  &gt;Static typing means that the language itself always trusts you and assumes that whatever object you use actually has the type you say it does. [...] On the other hand, dynamically typed languages always check if the value is actually suitable for that operation you’re about to perform on it.  His description of static typing is the description of dynamic typing, his description of dynamic typing is the description of static typing. The point of having a type system is that you *don't trust the programmer* and *don't assume objects have the correct type*. You can compile a statically typed language to code that doesn't runtime check anything *because you checked it beforehand*, and that's an implementation detail. Types are not about performance.  &gt;Note that a sufficiently motivated programmer will always find a way to crash his program, and no amount of compile-time checks will prevent that.  Dependent types can and do guarantee your program is always correct.  The ""What is a type system, anyway?"" section goes on with the misconception that types are about efficiency. And that type systems are not about data but code, but code is data and objects of type Int most certainly are data too.  &gt;To begin with, Ruby contains quite a few methods with static type signatures requiring a very certain class to be present.  ... Which will throw a (catchable!) exception at runtime. Well-typed programs ""don't go wrong"", ill-typed programs are not well-formed programs.  &gt;Can you imagine a completely statically typed language without any type annotations? How practical do you think will it be? Hint: you’re using one right now (indirectly). It’s called “assembly”. ↩  Untyped. ",↩

t5_2qh9k,Gro-Tsen,1357581656,"&gt; Debt, it argues, is just one source of revenue to pay obligations (others sources of revenue include income tax, etc.).  Allow me to play the devil's advocate here: as far as I understand it, in standard accounting principles, creating new debt, i.e., running a [deficit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance) *is not* considered a source of revenue (although I agree that, logically, it is): to quote the above-cited Wikipedia article, ""budget balance is the difference between government revenues (e.g., tax) and spending"" (if deficit were considered as a source of revenue, then the budget balance would, by definition, be exactly zero).  So from an accountant's point of view, creating new debt is *not* an ordinary form of revenue, it is an absence of revenue.  I have no opinion as to whether this makes sense *legally*, but if it does, this part of the argument seems to fall.  I don't know much about the US, but from what I understand, this is how things work in many countries: the executive branch collects revenue and spends money according to the budget acted by the legislative branch, and when the two don't match, either the treasury's account in the country's central bank runs negative (which amounts to borrowing from the central bank) or, as is now more common because borrowing directly from the central bank is considered Not A Good Thing®, a special agency of the treasury issues bonds.  Why did the US interpret things differently, if it does?  Is it because the accounting principles are different, or is it because of different legal principles?  It would seem to me that if one decides that creating new debt must also be authorized by the legislative branch, one is in effect creating a second tier of debt with a different name (""obligations"") which again functions as a kind of ""default of revenue or absence of revenue"" (namely not paying one's bills and not calling it ""debt"" either).  Does this really make sense?",®

Let me check if I can get it  EDIT  **Abstract**: Nest-building is a great ape universal and arboreal nesting in chimpanzees and bonobos suggests that the common ancestor of Pan and Homo also nested in trees. It has been proposed that arboreal nest-building remained the prevailing pattern until Homo erectus, a fully terrestrial biped, emerged. We investigated the unusual occurrence of ground-nesting in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which may inform on factors influencing the tree-to-ground sleep transition in the hominin lineage. We used a novel genetic approach to examine ground-nesting in unhabituated chimpanzees at Seringbara in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea. Previous research showed that ground-nesting at Seringbara was not ecologically determined. Here, we tested a possible mate-guarding function of ground-nesting by analyzing DNA from shed hairs collected from ground nests and tree nests found in close proximity. We examined whether or not ground-nesting was a group-level behavioral pattern and whether or not it occurred in more than one community. We used multiple genetic markers to identify sex and to examine variation in mitochondrial DNA control region (HV1, HV2) sequences. Ground-nesting was a male-biased behavior and males constructed more elaborate (“night”) nests than simple (“day”) nests on the ground. The mate-guarding hypothesis was not supported, as ground and associated tree nests were built either by maternally-related males or possibly by the same individuals. Ground-nesting was widespread and likely habitual in two communities. We suggest that terrestrial nest-building may have already occurred in arboreally-adapted early hominins before the emergence of H. erectus.

Do not stare or you could scare them and potentially trigger a flashback to a traumatic moment. This is the worst possible thing you can do to another human, short of **TRIGGER WARNING** r*pe.  3. The mate may or may not approach you. If he/she/ze so decides to approach you, do not immediately talk about sexual relations. This is seen as offensive.  4. After you have made the customary small talk, carefully and delicately hint at that you might possibly be interested in consensual nonthreatening cuddling with maybe sexual intercourse if you know you're into that maybe.  5. Assure he/she/ze that you are absolutely not a rapist and in fact have defended ex-rape victims over the Internet.  6. Make sure you both sign the Consensual Sex Agreement Pact paperwork.  7.

t5_2tkgx,secretlyadog,1357629304,"1. Internal Manufacturing -  I may have misunderstood what you are asking here.   &gt; Set up incentives for industrial characters to refine ore and manufacture items to sell back to the corporation for common use. Ammo, T1 Hulls mostly.   This leads me to believe that you want your builders to [a] take Corp Minerals and [b] build Corp Equipment.   Why would you pay them, then? Aside from the cost of build slots building costs 0 effort to them. Just click click click and wait for the items to pop out. Besides which, paying them would increase the cost of the items to the point where your members would be spending more than market price for the equipment. Payment to them should be minimal.  &gt; Thinking of using something like BYOM so the lower level characters can mine, and create contracts to have the higher level characters refine/manufacture for them with less waste. The question is how to set the incentives properly for this, so manufacturing for the corporation is profitable for them, rather than just doing it themselves and selling on the market.  Incentives for properly building using another persons minerals? What do you mean by ""do it themselves and sell on the market""? Again, we're talking about using ANOTHER person's minerals. That's called theft. Or do you mean what is keeping a builder from buying minerals using buy orders, cutting all of your miners out of the equation, and then building stuff for the market? Honestly, if he is smart he is probably doing this as well. Build orders do not take that long, nowhere near as long as waiting for your buy orders to fill. He could do both CORP builds and personal easily.  A very small %age overage of the mineral would be one way. You have a BPO for Spinning Rifter Rims that requires 1,000 Units of Tritanium? Your miner provides 1,050 Units to the builder. Every 20th job the builder has his own free Spinning Rifter Rims. He will probably have a lot of downtime between build jobs anyways so as long as his build tax is compensated it would be free ISK. Of course, your miners may realize they are paying an extra 5% in ore per item and decide to see if this is an actual SAVINGS to them vs. buying on the market. Spreadsheets!   &gt; Have outstanding contracts with a reasonable payout for any Industry character to pick up, manufacture the item, and get paid via corporate wallet?  Yes. This. Exactly. But what would be a reasonable payout? Consider:  ► you want to pay MORE than what the miner can get by dumping his minerals on the market  ► you want your member to pay LESS than what it would cost them to buy item on the market, otherwise, why even sell it to them?  That doesn't leave much **wiggle room** to pay the builder, who, again, is doing very little work.   I once built 100 units of every race's best T1  frigates for a ""great noob battleroyale"" using two toons with perfect build and it only took me about 5 days. Your builders slots will be mostly unused. If you are building 1,000 units of T1 Frigates every week then you need to have a ""How Not to Explode Your Frigate"" class with your guys.   ◘ ◘ ◘   Having run a corp of SpaceJews™ before I can tell you EVE players can be  VERY aggressive when it comes to ISK. There is one thing you will NEED to run a mining / industrial corp: *SPREADSHEETS*.   Let's say you live in Gallente Space and you are building Thoraxes. You will want to know the FULL BUILD PRICE of a Thorax if you:   [a] buy all the minerals from SELL orders at the closest reasonable highsec (expect almost 0 profit)  [b] buy all the minerals using BUY orders from the closest reasonable highsec (be patient, and be ready to hit the .01 buttons alot)  [c] buy the actual ITEM itself from a buy order  Many times I have found buying the build components for an item (especially T2) just from SELLERS to actually outweigh the sale price of the item. No spreadsheet and you just lost money.   Then the issue becomes SpaceTards™ and SpaceJews™. Some of your miners, especially the noobs, will just dump their ore to BUY orders in your home system. This is GREAT for you, and the best buy order in your home system should be YOURS in case some of them do this while you are not online.   It is usually easy to offer more ISK than the highest buy order in your system and still profit. If not, it is overpriced buy order and you should clear all your stock out to it.   SpaceTards™ and SpaceJews™, however, will claim to have no problem hauling their cut to the nearest high priced buy order 15 jumps away, and will ask THAT price. In some cases the buy order in a market hub is actually MORE than the actual SELL orders near your 15 jumps away backwater mining home, and buying at these prices will cause the final item to be much less profitable.   In some cases this ""hauling time"" will have been miss-spent, and the idea that they are wasting time they could be mining more for a measly .25 ISK difference will be completely lost on them. In SOME cases the difference will be that much it actually DOES payoff to go haul it. Which brings us to SpaceJews™.  A SpaceJew™ does not dump his minerals to a *compradore*. He sells them himself using sell orders, and waits as the ISK trickles in, because he knows he will be making more this way. It will almost never be profitable for you to try to compete with the market for his business.   The only way you can gain and hold the loyalty of such aggressive EVE merchants is to provide them with avenues for making ISK they would not have alone.  [TLDR] Spreadsheets!",™

t5_2tkgx,TheOneBlackMage,1357667979,"LONG BUT DID READ.  Just trying to find ways to have the industrials contribute to the corporations, and automate it.  The tax system fills the corporate wallet from missions and bounties, but it's harder to have the industrials contribute without having to rely on honor system or policing.  So from this I took away:  1.  Time/ISK cost of manufacturing is low so don't pay out for this.  Can advertise which characters can manufacture for others,  as long as they bring the required materials.  If the corp already has the blueprint, great.  Otherwise they can bring a copy along with the minerals.  Can have contracts with reasonable payouts to manufacture items that we either want to give away via corp hangars, or use a lot of.  2.  Standing buy order in system for all of the minerals commonly mined locally - I do like this idea to ensure that we don't get players just dumping on the market instead of selling to corp.  3.  Fortunately I don't think we have many SpaceJews™ as most of us are alt-mining while we mission together, or semi-AFK.  I just need to make sure that we are bringing in enough for the corporation to pay for the offices, POS, fuel, etc.  I don't want to be too oppressive with corp taxes, but I'm still not sure on how to get each member to contribute equally, and to automate it as much as possible.",™

It hurts when you're shown, by your own people no less, that your propaganda is wrong, doesn't it?    **Facial Muscles**   CARNIVORE: Reduced to allow wide mouth gape   HERBIVORE: Well-developed   OMNIVORE: Reduced   HUMAN: Well-developed    Why are reduced facial muscles necessary for most meat eaters? The post even explains in the case of carnivores that it is in order to allow for a wide mouth gape. Some carnivores and omnivores hunt using their mouths as an important instrument in the kill. Humans do not use this method. We have historically used our hands in combination with tools in order to hunt and thus have never needed a wide mouth gape in order to hunt. This same explanation applies to why we have a seemingly herbivorous jaw type, jaw joint location, jaw motion, major jaw muscles, mouth opening versus head size, teeth of all types. There are still carnivorous and omnivorous species which do not hunt large prey with their mouths. Pigs are omnivores, eating leaves, grasses, roots, flowers, as well as insects and dead carcasses in the wild. Since their hunting style doesn't require them to kill large animals with their mouths they have facial structures very similar to our own in all of these areas.  **Stomach Capacity**   CARNIVORE: 60% to 70% of total volume of digestive tract   HERBIVORE: Less than 30% of total volume of digestive tract   OMNIVORE: 60% to 70% of total volume of digestive tract   HUMAN: 21% to 27% of total volume of digestive tract    Once again this applies to carnivorous and omnivorous species that hunt large prey. These animals often go for long periods between meals and then will consume a single large meal to survive on for long periods at a time. Most herbivores tend to graze throughout the day, not needing to hold a single large meal in their stomachs at once. Humans as animals that have evolved in small tribal settings have been able to share the meat of large kills with members of their community and have otherwise continued to typically eat several small meals throughout the day.  **Colon**   CARNIVORE: Simple, short and smooth   HERBIVORE: Long, complex; may be sacculated   OMNIVORE: Simple, short and smooth   HUMAN: Long, sacculated    Humans are along with all other primates in having sacculated colons. Ruminants are another group that tends to have sacculated colons. Sacculation of the colon in simple terms simply refers to the structure of tucks and pouches we find in our colon. In humans and primates this is thought to be a special adaptation to fermentation, allowing us to extract more energy from fiber.Source This adaptation would not be useful for carnivores who don't consume any significant amount of fiber. For other omnivores and many other herbivores they have likely all struck upon different solutions for improving digestion of fiber which doesn't require sacculation of the colon, much as many animals have evolved unique solutions to solving the problem of seeing.  **Kidney**   CARNIVORE: Extremely concentrated urine   HERBIVORE: Moderately concentrated urine   OMNIVORE: Extremely concentrated urine   HUMAN: Moderately concentrated urine    Animals with unconcentrated urine risk wasting too much water in order to excrete wastes through their urine. Animals with concentrated urine put themselves at higher risk of developing kidney stones and other kidney issues. Being a carnivore or herbivore has very little to do with striking this balance, while the prevalence of water plays a much larger role.  **Nails**   CARNIVORE: Sharp claws   HERBIVORE: Flattened nails or blunt hooves   OMNIVORE: Sharp claws   HUMAN: Flattened nails    Similar to facial structures, having sharp claws is only necessary if an animal is going to use these for hunting. Humans have never hunted using our nails and thus evolving sharp claws would be entirely unnecessary and quite a burden in our social lives. Once again omnivores like pigs or carnivores like anteaters do not have the features associated with their respective groups here.  **Length of Small Intestine**   CARNIVORE: 3 to 6 times body length   HERBIVORE: 10 to more than 12 times body length   OMNIVORE: 4 to 6 times body length   HUMAN: 10 to 11 times body length    This is not an accurate measure for omnivorous pigs whose, “small intestines have an average length of 15 to 20 m”Source. For those of you who aren't entirely familiar with the metric system a pig has a body length a little over one meter.  **Source**   [Vegan Sceptic](http://veganskeptic.blogspot.ch/2010/10/are-humans-omnivores.html)  ---  **Archeological Record**  As far back as it can be traced, clearly the archeological record indicates an omnivorous diet for humans that included meat. Our ancestry is among the hunter/gatherers from the beginning. Once domestication of food sources began, it included both animals and plants.    **Cell Types**  Relative number and distribution of cell types, as well as structural specializations, are more important than overall length of the intestine to determining a typical diet. Dogs are typical carnivores, but their intestinal characteristics have more in common with omnivores. Wolves eat quite a lot of plant material.    **Fermenting Vats**  Nearly all plant eaters have fermenting vats (enlarged chambers where foods sits and microbes attack it). Ruminants like cattle and deer have forward sacs derived from remodeled esophagus and stomach. Horses, rhinos, and colobine monkeys have posterior, hindgut sacs. Humans have no such specializations.    **Jaws**  Although evidence on the structure and function of human hands and jaws, behavior, and evolutionary history also either support an omnivorous diet or fail to support strict vegetarianism, the best evidence comes from our teeth.  The short canines in humans are a functional consequence of the enlarged cranium and associated reduction of the size of the jaws. In primates, canines function as both defense weapons and visual threat devices. Interestingly, the primates with the largest canines (gorillas and gelada baboons) both have basically vegetarian diets. In archeological sites, broken human molars are most often confused with broken premolars and molars of pigs, a classic omnivore. On the other hand, some herbivores have well-developed incisors that are often mistaken for those of human teeth when found in archeological excavations.    **Salivary Glands**  These indicate we could be omnivores. Saliva and urine data vary, depending on diet, not taxonomic group.    **Intestines**  Intestinal absorption is a surface area, not linear problem. Dogs (which are carnivores) have intestinal specializations more characteristic of omnivores than carnivores such as cats. The relative number of crypts and cell types is a better indication of diet than simple length. We are intermediate between the two groups.    **Conclusion**  Humans are classic examples of omnivores in all relevant anatomical traits. There is no basis in anatomy or physiology for the assumption that humans are pre-adapted to the vegetarian diet. For that reason, the best arguments in support of a meat-free diet remain ecological, ethical, and health concerns.   **Source**  [Dr. McArdle. © 1996-2012 The Vegetarian Resource Group](http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/omni.htm)   Dr. McArdle is a vegetarian and currently Scientific Advisor to The American Anti-Vivisection Society.

t5_2sokd,aramid,1357685476,"You know how a turbojet works, so you probably also know that they're not very efficient.  Pushing a small amount of air very quickly doesn't make a lot of thrust for the amount of energy it requires - think about how much more air a desk fan blows than an air compressor blow nozzle.  Then think about how hard the air compressor works to blow that air.  A turbojet is like the air compressor, blowing a tiny amount of air very fast.  A desk fan is like a propeller, moving a lot of air a small amount.  But propellers have some limitations.  They can only spin so fast before the tips go past the sound barrier and things get all weird, so there was call for a hybrid of the two designs.  A turbofan is essentially a small, high-speed propeller, powered by a smaller turbojet engine.  It moves less air than a propeller, but moves it a lot faster - but still not as fast as a turbojet.  So it's capable of flying a plane faster than a prop, but more efficiently than a turbojet.  It's still a sliding scale, though.  Some engines are designed to be more like a propeller, and others are designed to be more like a turbojet.  A modern airliner like the 787 only runs 10% of the air passing through it into the turbojet core - 90% of the air only passes through the fan.  So it's a lot like a prop, and good for efficiency but not great at really high speeds.  Because it's being heated and accelerated more, the air going through the core does more than its fair share of work - that 10% of air provides about 20% of the thrust.  The 90% going through the fan provides the other 80% of the thrust.  A faster, sleeker plane like a fighter jet needs a different design.  Turbojets are so inefficient that any fighter designed in the last 40 years now uses a turbofan, but it's nothing like the one in the airliner.  Instead of most of the air going around the outside, something like 75% of the air goes through the turbofan core and produces something like 80% of the total thrust.  The extra 25% going around the outside, through the fan only, makes the last 20% of the thrust.  But it helps cool the engine and helps keep more thrust at lower speeds, and also makes the engine more efficient.  It's still more wasteful than the airliner engine, but it's faster and the military pays the bills.  Plus, the air from the fan rejoins the exhaust before leaving the plane, and provides lots of fresh, clean oxygen to the afterburner.  So for those rare occasions where you don't care at all about fuel and just need More Power™, you're well supplied.",™

t5_2cneq,Willravel,1357693294,"&gt;Using a phrase as charged as ""tools of murder"" suggest you believe there is no legitimate use for them.  They're built specifically as tools to kill things. That's their primary function. Soldiers use them to kill other soldiers or farmers. Hunters use them to kill animals. Law Abiding Citizens ™ use them to kill intruders. When you go to a shooting range, you're getting better at using the killing tool to kill. People don't seem to get worked up when I call a shovel a tool of digging, though they may question the way I phrased it. Shovels are built for the purpose of digging, guns are built for the purpose of ending life.   But, again, we're moving away from what we were talking about. Guns, as tools which are built to kill, are highly efficient at that use. They're not like knives, requiring very close combat to be effective, they're not like more rudimentary projectile weapons like bows which require a lot of skill. They're a bit like bombs, in that they're an easy way to kill a lot of people, only bombs are illegal. That was why I brought up the case in China originally, because we had someone similarly deranged to our school shooter, but who didn't have access to a gun. My point, put very simply, is that when you can't get a gun, it's harder to kill people.   &gt;You seem to be confusing ""lower"" and ""reduced.""

But Charles the Monarch isn’t nearly so vicious. He’s a Labradoodle shaved to look like the mascot of Old Dominion University.  Someone called police to report a baby lion on the loose, possibly looking for food, on Colley Avenue near 50th Street. Police then called the zoo around 10:15 a.m. to make sure both of the real lions were in their cages. Mramba, the male lion at the zoo, and Zola, the female lion, remain in their habitats, reports Winfield Danielson, a zoo spokesman.  But Charles the Monarch was on the loose, owner Daniel Painter said.  Charles typically hangs out with his owner at Painter’s business, Daniel’s Lawn and Garden Center, on Colley Avenue. Charles likes to dine at University Pizza, Painter said.  “He has a thousand and 200 some friends on Facebook,” he said.  Painter said police have told him several times that someone reported seeing a lion when it was really his dog. He also said he’s taken his dog from his Riverview home to the park near the zoo and seen people run to their cars in shock.  “They think it’s a lion out there,” he said.  “I tell people he’s a Lab-a-lion, and half the people believe that.”",©

t5_2r65t,beedrue,1357704474,"Well, I think $80 is a too much for that shoe, used. It is probably made in India or China, and I have a suspicion that the sole is actually glued onto the shoe rather than stitched (as it appears). The retail cost new was probably not much over $100.  Others have said this style is outdated, but I think it is an acceptable option in a business-casual setting. If you like the apron-toe style (also called moc toe), or something similar like the algonquin, or split-toe, then I say go for it!  The cost of a shoe is really determined by what you are willing to pay and how much and for how long you plan to wear it. There are apron toe shoes that cost more than $300 that will last you for many years, but to keep a shoe for that long you would need to commit to taking care of them by polishing them regularly and not letting them get too damaged by water. There are also lots of options for this style in thrift stores and on sale that can bring the total to less than $50. Beware that generally new leather shoes in the $50 to $100 range are not of good quality.  Personally, I have two shoes similar to the one you posted and I wear them each about once every two or three weeks. The first is a rubber sole shoe that I wear when it is rainy/damp outside and I don't want to mess up nicer shoes. It is made by Gordon Rush and some will clearly hate this style, but [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mens-Shoes-Gordon-Rush-Fulton-Oxford-Apron-Toe-Brown-Size-12-M-/150966906474?pt=US_Men_s_Shoes&amp;hash=item2326542e6a&amp;ssPageName=RSS:B:SHOP:US:101) is a similar version. I bought these at nordstrom rack for about $80. The second [one](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Peal-Co.®-Algonquin-Split-Toes/273H________BRWN_10___D___,default,pd.html)  is a nicer shoe and is made to last for years (and is constructed in a way that allows the sole and/or heel to be replaced by a cobbler--in this case ""goodyear welted""). I bought it during the brooks brothers sales over the summer for around $400. Both are comfortable and fairly good business-casual shoes, but the quality of the leather and construction is better on the shoe made for brooks brothers. Generally, I don't think either one is a great everyday dress shoe, but they each have their place in a broader set of shoes.   If you are contemplating buying a brown leather *dress* shoe because you don't currently have one, then I would suggest instead a medium or dark brown leather cap-toe balmoral. If you are looking for something like the one above that is similar in price but a better ""deal"", I would say just make sure that the sole is not any thicker and that the shape of the toe (not the apron) is not any more square. You can search for apron toe or moc toe, but I think the two best options might be used or on sale the Allen Edmonds Lasalle or used or on sale the Cole Haan Air Adams Split Toe (not as good of quality as the AE shoe).  I hope this helps some. Many on MFA would disagree with me, but I'm not a big fan of cuffed jeans or the clark's desert boot, so just go with what you like.  edit: reading your other comments on here I think you already know most of what I posted. I say instead go with something similar to the allen edmonds park avenue (brown leather cap-toe balmoral). It's more formal but it is classic and also in style. A less formal alternative is the allen edmonds [clifton](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/allen-edmonds-clifton-oxford/3158930?origin=keywordsearch&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=0) which I have in walnut and is a great shoe and on sale right now.",®

""Here are the details about the SuperNatural® package from Callaway’s promotional materials:  Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack 0-60 in 4.1 seconds Quarter Mile in 12.5 seconds @ 115 mph  Callaway Cars is pleased to introduce the first SuperNatural® package for the Dodge Viper, the Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack.  Applying the principals of “tuned natural aspiration” developed successfully on the Callaway SuperNatural® Corvette ZR1 and LT1-based 400/383, the Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack enhances the 400 Viper engine’s breathing with improvements to both the intake and exhaust systems. It gives a noticeable improvement in the Viper’s already exciting performance, better throttle response and a more pleasing exhaust note.  The Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack consists of three elements, each duplicated for each bank of the RT/10 engine:  · High capacity air intake with low restriction air cleaners and laminar flow ducts; · Port-matched throttle bodies; and · T304 stainless steel cat-back exhausts with proprietary mufflers.  Installation takes three days at Callaway’s shop in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Each Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack is test driven to ensure its performance and reliability. Replacement parts, including air filter elements, are readily available from Callaway. The Callaway Viper 440 Six-Pack does not affect the factory warranty from Dodge.  The factory “look” of the Viper is not affected. The cat-back exhaust fits under the stock Viper side pipe covers. Under the Viper hood the only visible change is a pair of mirror-polished 6061-T6 aluminum alloy high-capacity ducts that replace the convoluted stock air ducts between the filter enclosure and the throttle body. Available at the owner’s option is “Callaway 440” identification for the front fender just under the “RT/10” Viper logo.""",®

Proving somebody owns an address is very difficult if they don't re-use them, which the standard bitcoin client specifically prevents in its normal operating mode.  &gt;     [✔] bitcoins are safe  Indeed they are!  If the crypto involved ever gets cracked, the network will immediately switch over to using newer, better crypto.  All that takes is expanding the keyspace and using a longer version of known working block cyphers.  Instead of SHA256, it'll use SHA512.  Nobody serious about crypto uses SHA1 any more because that's considered likely to be cracked soon, even though a collision hasn't yet been found.  Unless a fundamental flaw in the crypto is found, any ""crack"" will be known BEFORE it happens because it will be only a matter of time and computing power.  And all it takes for bitcoin to update and use new crypto is for somebody to write a patch, put it up for download, and miners all switch to using it.  That would happen in less than a day if there truly was a major vulnerability found.  As far as brute-forcing goes, many people mistakenly believe it's only a matter of time before we have the computing power necessary to do this.  That's just not true.  Unless a vulnerability is found or somebody proves one of the current hardest problems in math and computing and shows that P=NP, bitcoin will be secure.  There's a reason why Bruce Schneier, the foremost expert on security and crypto, in his book Applied Cryptography, wrote about symmetric crypto keys of length 2^256:  &gt; These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that **brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.**",✔

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/qcw19.jpg) is the aforementioned Tapcofucked™ Norinco SKS.  I paid the guy 80 dollars for it.  My ***intent*** was to throw a nicer stock on it, do a quick and dirty Duracoat job on it, get rid of that terrible scope in favor of a cheap reflex sight, and put it out for sale. But my distributor didn't have the stock I wanted in stock, so I figured it would be a week or so before I could get it done.  Anyway, my gun wall is pretty empty, so in the meantime, I logged it into my book, put a tag on it, and hung it on the wall.  ***I did not price the gun, since I wasn't planning on selling it right away. I just hung it on the wall because the lone long gun I have left in stock (a new Remington 870 20ga) looked lonely.***  Yesterday, a guy comes in.  The guy sees the SKS.  The guy asks me ""Is that SKS for sale?""  I tell him I hadn't really thought about it, but if he wanted to buy, I'm sure we could strike a deal.  The guy asks ""How much?""  I tell him to make me an offer.  The guy says ""How about 300 dollars?""  I tell him it sounds like we have a deal.  He does the paperwork, gets approved, buys the gun and all my remaining 7.62 ammo.  Total price out the door was $544.21.  Kindly imagine my face in [this](http://i.imgur.com/4EX8o.gif) gif.",™

t5_2qstm,meats_the_parent,1357775850,"&gt; Should I go for the Roth IRA or treasury bills?  Why not do both?  Bills range in length of time from ""[a few days to 52 weeks](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbills_glance.htm).""  Vanguard's [Prime Money Market](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0030&amp;FundIntExt=INT) is 23.7% in U.S. Treasury Bills.  I'm sure you can find other funds that are more heavily invested in T-Bills.  You can hold these funds in a Roth IRA.  If you plan on withdrawing the money later than 52 weeks, then look at Notes and Bonds for fixed income alternatives.  You can withdraw *contributions* from Roth IRAs at any time.  &gt; Also, should i think about moving my 401(k) around in Fidelity and not just keep it to the fund they assigned me to?  With [Freedom K Fund 2055](http://quote.morningstar.com/fund/f.aspx?t=FDENX) at ~21% fixed-income, this seems right in my mind, going by the age-in-bonds heuristic.  However, it does seem cash-heavy at ~12%.  It's a good start, either way.  I suggest reading through [this](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy) before making any changes.  &gt; How can I lower the taxes on my income?  * Max out your annual 401k contribution, thereby reducing your taxable income.  ($17,500 for 2013.)  * Switch to a health insurance plan that allows you to start a [HSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account); max it out.  ($3,250 for 2013.)  These are especially great because unlike with 401Ks, contributions are exempt from FICA tax.  * Donate to eligible charities and itemize your deductions during filing.  (Make sure your deductions are greater than the standard deduction at $5,950 for 2012.)  * Get a mortgage and receive the mortgage-interest deduction.  * Start a LLC or S-Corp and shelter your money in the company.",®

t5_2snuc,gregregregreg,1357777831,"&gt;I can easily conclude that complete certainty arises with logical necessity(take a law such as identity). I am now open to your explanation of how this sort of certainty can arise any other way.  You seem to make the assumption that if we can't be certain of contingent truths, then God can't be certain of contingent truths. But I don't think that need be the case. In fact, I don't see any reason to accept that there is something about contingent truths which makes it impossible to know them with certainty. You'd have to explain what that 'something' is. From the mere fact that you argue that we are only certain of logically necessary truths, it does not follow that it is *impossible* to be certain of non-necessary truths.  Moreover, I'm certain I exist on the basis of my experience, but my existence isn't necessary. Thus I am certain of a contingent truth and your claim is false.  &gt;D isn't simply all truths in the actual world, it is also all the truths in whatever world God is.  I defined D as all truths in *only* the actual world a couple comments back, if I recall correctly. And by the actual world, I mean the world in which we exist. Apologies for not emphasizing this.  &gt;That is, some proposition's value in the world God is, can't be contradictory to god's knowledge of said proposition, but god's knowledge is of the actual world.  Let *w* denote the world in which we exist. You're implying that God's knowledge necessarily consists of *w*'s truths, which I deny and don't maintain as an adequate description of infallible foreknowledge. I never stated that I believe God knows *w*'s truths necessarily.  &gt;Is it possible that you choose otherwise, given God's knowledge of your choice to be the actual world?  It is logically possible that I choose otherwise because there are possible worlds in which I choose something other than what I choose in *w*.  &gt;Just so we're clear, it is not just perfect knowledge of the future, it is merely perfect knowledge entailing all past, present, future and anything there is.  Yup.  &gt;Sure D(is not by definition actual, btw) and gKD are equivalent logically speaking, but it is also true that gKD is necessarily so.  This is now very confusing because I don't know what definition of 'necessary' you're using. It could mean 'not logically possibly false' or the standard dictionary definition of the term. I try to avoid using the word when its modal definition is relevant, since otherwise equivocation would become rampant.  &gt;And no way am I putting that in a formal way.  I doubt it takes more time than typing out paragraph after paragraph explaining your argument. Plus it would be much more clear, since again, I don't know when you're using the modal definition of 'necessary' and when you aren't.  &gt;therefore gKD ↔ D  &gt;was what I previously stated as the logical equivalence of gKD and D.  You said,  ""necessarily gKD is logically equivalent to D.""  And I took that to mean ☐gKD is logically equivalent to D.  &gt;since I make no big implied logical connections it's quite comprehensible, the words are enough for any reasonable person to understand my argument.  It's not as easy as you make it out to be. I have no idea how each mention of 'necessary' is defined, so I cannot even form a response to your argument without straw manning it. It is also strange that you say you don't want to waste time creating a syllogism out of your argument, since that might even require *less* time than presenting it in paragraph format.",↔

t5_2qhbe,Girlwithnousername,1357781138,"Take a deep breath and sit down, you’re about to be traumatised.  http://imgur.com/b15bW So the fridge freezer is about 3ft tall and 2ft wide. But to put things into perspective, you have a VAST amount of land in the States, and we don’t – our cities are very cluttered and our country is small.  I would say that in the UK over the last ten years, larger fridge freezers have started to become more incorporated into kitchen design. We see your vast space and we envy it.  I’m not sure how it works your side of the pond, but here (and certainly for the last 30 years), owners wanting a new kitchen will go to a DIY store or a kitchen showroom and order everything at once. The layout of the kitchen is usually incorporated as part of a design process and often included within the price. What you pay for a kitchen design can range from anything between £800 (without white goods) to £20,000 (possibly including white goods), depending on where you go and the quality of the workmanship; whether it’s off the shelf or custom-made, and whether it includes a fitting fee or not. Those who buy off the shelf usually fit the kitchen themselves to keep costs down. With that in mind, it’s not difficult to imagine that a family with few DIY skills and little money will keep the structure of current kitchen units and just replace the doors and white goods when they fail. I would guess your average family would pay around £2,000 for the whole job, and they would usually only do it to increase the value of the property – otherwise they’d just change the cupboard doors. So, if you have a small fridge in a pre-fitted kitchen, it’s not cheap or easy to change, unless you want it hanging around in an odd space somewhere or a different room.   Also there’s still a ‘waste not want not’ mentally from the war days and the decade following the end of WWII. We’re only really two generations from WWII and those who survived, and although consumers have much more choice and can now afford to throw away food at will, that mentality still takes its time to stop. As a girl in her 30s I can tell you that as a child, I was served the same plate of food for breakfast, dinner and lunch the next day if I refused to eat it and until I ate it. On the rare occasion that we could afford a roast dinner, the meat was left in the centre of the table and not allowed to be touched until all the veg was consumed. To give this mentality some credit, I will now eat almost anything… but you try telling that to a seven year old child who is gagging over the taste of a particular food! However, I’ve since seen teenagers who won’t eat anything other than chicken nuggets, so although my food discipline was harsh, I can see where my mother was coming from. I digress: the mentality still exists and may continue for a few generations yet; it’s not just me, I see similar amongst friends from all parts of the country.   How do we survive? I live in a city and everything I need is on my doorstep (almost literally – I have an astonishingly good shop within 15 paces from my sofa and it’s open 24/7). Those who don’t live with such good access tend to live further out, have more space in their homes and buy bigger fridges and freezers, or just plan further in advance. It’s quite normal to see people carrying bags of shopping home on public transport on their way home from work.   That said, there are people who can afford cheaper houses in cheaper locations with much more space. It’s also not uncommon to store a freezer in a garage or an outside space such as a shed in these instances.  The majority of people at least now own a fridge the size of mine plus a freezer the same size these days. Those more fortunate with space or money have 5ft high fridge-freezers, and some will have a 5ft high fridge AND a separate freezer too (perhaps stored in a garage). But I have yet to come across a single person who has the vast sizes of fridges and freezers that you have in the States.   For me, it’s an economy of space and mental wellbeing. I rent my place so I can’t make changes, but I threw out a desktop freezer that I owned (which was only the size of a microwave anyway) when I moved because I had to sleep in the same space as it and it gurgled and bubbled all night and kept me awake. I had to prioritise losing hours and hours of sleep every night over the ability to batch cook meals and save money by freezing things.  It could be a lot worse: I have near-silent neighbors, access to the thrills of a great city on my doorstep and I can almost stumble out of bed to buy milk next door when I run out some mornings.    The boxed milk is called UHT and not many people use it. It’s fine in coffee but tastes revolting if drunk straight. It’s usually a store cupboard emergency backup. And no, we don’t usually resort to powdered eggs these days ☺  EDIT: for those of you who are interested in the lengths Brits had to go to to secure food and provisions during WWII, I would highly recommend looking up the BBC series 'wartime farm.'

t5_2qhbe,Girlwithnousername,1357790290,"The flat is tiny, it’s 18ft x 9ft including the bathroom and hallway = 162 square foot in total space. It’s a studio flat, so my sofa is also my sofa bed to sleep on. Quite unusually for studio flats, the kitchen area takes up almost half the space. Usually you find that you have maybe four kitchen cupboards in a tiny area in a corner and a rickety cheap oven and stove. I have 10 kitchen cupboards (one of which contains the bin/trash can) and 3 kitchen drawers. It’s the space that I would need and want, but it is EXTREMELY rare to come across such kitchen space in a small London flat. Rare enough that in 20 years, I’ve never seen similar.   The hob has four burners and the oven is a full sized oven. Usually in such small spaces the oven is too narrow to fit most oven trays inside, or lacks enough shelf space – mine is the standard size that most families would buy for their homes. The ceramic hob is really good quality, as is the oven. Both of these are quite unusual in such a small flat, as is the relatively large amount of work surface space for a studio.   I live on my own and so rarely order pizzas big enough to cause fridge issues space issues. I also don’t eat a lot of pizza ☺   It’s not especially normal, no. Most of my friends either flatshare or are part of a couple so can afford to split the rent or mortgage and live in a larger space. ALL areas of London are densely populated, but if I had to describe my area, it’s a typical London borough whereby the wealthy and the not so wealthy live side by side. There are areas surrounding me which have been gentrified and have houses costing £450,000 to millions, and others where people struggle to feed their children and are supported by government funding and couldn’t begin to imagine affording to own a property here. I’ve been keeping an eye on flat prices in the area: a one bedroom or large studio flat to suit my requirements (larger than this and with a good fitted kitchen) would cost £180,000 ($288,000).   I made a conscious decision to live alone rather than flatshare, and I pay around £910 ($1450) a month in rent and utilities and internet and suchlike. Before you fall off your chair at the cost, consider that my rent is VERY reasonable in London terms. I live in a fairly popular area with easy access to the City and the West End, I have almost everything I need on my doorstep and I have a really good landlord and managing agent. Space aside, this is a combination that’s almost unheard of. Most London landlords suck major arse and good managing agents are like fairy dust.  Here are some pictures to satisfy your curiosity. I couldn’t be bothered to do the washing up ☺  http://imgur.com/5BGNS http://imgur.com/MK6Oj http://imgur.com/UIhzK ",☺

t5_2rmpy,Sle,1357797627,"OK, that's not a ""Fridge freezer"", I have one and that's not one. All fridges have a little icebox, that's the bit that makes it cold. Mine is an equal sized fridge and freezer in one unit, about twice the size of that.  All of Europe has Fridges that size as well - in fact just about every country except, yep you guessed it, the US has fridges like this. Nothing to do with space really.  The ""Waste not, want not"" things is a figment of the imagination and again is no different to anywhere else in the world except maybe, again, the good old U S of A. Sounds like she had pretty psycopathic parents too. My mum was a dragon and made me eat every crumb, but certainly would not serve me the same meal again. I'm 36 by the way.  &gt;I have an astonishingly good shop within 15 paces from my sofa and it’s open 24/7  And costs a fortune - no way would you want to do shopping in a place like that on a regular basis. ""Please come again!""  &gt;It’s quite normal to see people carrying bags of shopping home on public transport on their way home from work.  Gasp!  &gt;But I have yet to come across a single person who has the vast sizes of fridges and freezers that you have in the States.  Yes, indeed this is true worldwide. So the question is really ""Why do Americans have such huge fridges?""  &gt;It could be a lot worse: I have near-silent neighbors, access to the thrills of a great city on my doorstep and I can almost stumble out of bed to buy milk next door when I run out some mornings. The boxed milk is called UHT and not many people use it. It’s fine in coffee but tastes revolting if drunk straight. It’s usually a store cupboard emergency backup. And no, we don’t usually resort to powdered eggs these days ☺  Cor.. What a picture of merry old England! What a funny place!

t5_2qhbe,Girlwithnousername,1357797865," Yes, you generally don't rent a place without a washing machine. I'd guess that 70-90% of rental flats have them, and probably near on 100% of home owners do. There are laundromats in the UK, but the majority of people would never choose to go to them voluntarily. There's one a two minute walk from my flat - they aren't uncommon, but they're a massive drag.  In 20 years of renting I have never lived in a flat without a washing machine, and on the few (maybe two) occasions I've viewed flats without them, I've said 'put a washing machine in or I don't move in.'  In bigger flats you also get a separate tumble dryer to dry the clothes too. Oh, how I miss that! But now I just have a clothes line, regulate when I do a wash and wait 2-3 days for stuff to dry.  Don’t feel guilty. I’m sure our respective countries have their pros and cons ☺",☺

FW                 6,30 IP  This is a valid deductive argument. Note I cleaned it up a bit -- you had a couple unnecessary premises.  If you can follow this proof, the key lies in the premises. Since (1) is effectively the definition of 'free will,' I take it to be undisputed. I also take (2) to be accepted, specifically because it merely states that belief and justification are necessary conditions for knowledge, which I take to be uncontroversial. (5) is really just the rejection of skepticism, which I expect is also uncontroversial, though a possible fallback bullet for the committed determinist to bite.  That leaves (3) and (4) as the obvious points of contention.  Regarding (3), it is not at all clear that a [belief] is justified only if it is also choosable (or is chosen); it seems like I don't have much choice but to believe that at least one thing exists, yet surely such a belief is justified. If that's the case, then (3) must be relaxed -- we can say that there are exists *something* such that to believe it is justified only if it is also choosable (or can be chosen), but this costs us validity. This is no good for the 'free will' proponent. If the 'free will' proponent would suggest that the belief that at least one thing exists is a belief which can be disbelieved, let her expound such a view here. I don't see how (3) survives that particular counterexample.  Regarding (4), it is surely the case that we can convince one another of things we do not actually *know* (see religion), but this is not particularly worrisome -- that premise is only needed for the redundant conclusion. The inference that allows us to reject determinism is available *without* the use of (4) (see line 18).  Thus, (3) is clearly the premise the determinist will reject, though she may also embrace skepticism, or dispute the necessary conditions of knowledge -- it is just odd to think that belief and justification would *not* be necessary conditions, and I don't particularly care to contend with skepticism.  I am not exactly a committed determinist, but I do find it extremely unlikely that we actually have 'free will'; I find a lack of a mechanism to be problematic, and I suspect the concept itself is incoherent.  If you like, I can elaborate, but for my present purposes, suffice it to say that I would indeed reject (3) based on its universal quantifier, and replacing it with an existential quantifier would render this argument invalid. I would even note that there are apparent counterexamples to (3) in the bible -- so the Christian presumably ought to reject (3) anyway.  If you have a different formulation of this argument you'd like to explore, I'm happy to consider it, but this one appears to have a fatal flaw in (3), and as I've said, without (3) the argument is invalid. In particular, the inference at line 15 would fail, and with it, the conclusion would not be attainable.",↔

Until it (The Devin issue) got posted in /r/gaming  it was posts about people looking for super zombies, talking about where to find the best loot, and general constructive topics. As soon as the Devin issue occurred nothing but hate, trolls, down-votes, and scam cries. I un-subbed for a few weeks and still only come here bi-weekly.  The roadmap is just that a map with goals and timetables, not every single one will be met. Hell I applaud Hammerpoint for even giving us a timetable most games from big publishers use ""Soon™"" for every release/patch/update. That gets annoying fast but its easy to see why they do it.  Staying in alpha/beta wouldn't have changed anything. They are still developing features for this game and as long as they continue to do so the game is still in development.  Never once have I felt scammed or lied to in the 300+ hours have put into war z. I have been annoyed at times because of changes (loot rate changes, re-spawn timer changes, crosshair changes) and because of cheaters but I'm adult enough to realize these things can and are getting fixed.",™

t5_2qhvl,Elliptical_Tangent,1357821585,"We're intellectual omnivores and not terribly diligent.  I see a lot of my own earlier years in your post (except for the sleep part - I've never had a problem geting to sleep, and only had problems getting up when I was shaving hours off).  If it helps, I graduated with a 2.x average from both HS and college, yet went on to have a decent (if haphazard) career, retiring at 37 in 2007.  I got an interdisciplinary degree in college, and loved it for its multifaceted nature (some facets more than others, as reflected in my GPA).  I didn't ever work in the field, but I'm still grateful for the perspective it gave me going into life.  In my mind, this is really what college should be about (at least at the undergraduate level), filling your philosophical toolbox for the work ahead of you.  Don't worry about the Js and their diligence - that's for them, not you.  When the shit hits the fan, they're going to fall apart while you make perfect sense of the situation.  Different strokes.  Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking there's a right way to get through life.  The kids who had it all in high school generally don't do as well after.  Same for college.  Your Golden Years™ are still ahead of you; just get through this time without deciding you're a failure, and you'll see.  As for sleep, one of the more rewarding classes I had in college was behavioral biology, and we spent a lot of time learning about sleep.  One thing we learned was that people fall into roughly 3 categories: those with a 24-hour internal clock, those with a 23 hour clock, and those with a 25 hour clock.  You, unfortunately, sound like you've got a 25 hour clock; 25 hour people always want to stay up later, and go to bed later because their internal day is longer.  The best advice I have to give, as a 24-hour person, is to do your best to settle on a bedtime and a risetime, and stick to it.  Set your phone to tell you when you should be going to bed every day.  When it goes off, do your bedtime routine, grab a book, and go read in bed.  You'll eventually get to sleep, and after 2 weeks of sticking to this schedule, it should be easier to get to sleep and to get up, as you ""program"" your body.  You also might want to look into multiphasic sleep.  I was a devoted napper in my Freshman year, napping every day from ~5-6PM, then sleeping from about 3AM to about 9AM.  Fresh as daisies.",™
t5_2qnp7,lil_cain,1357822116,"Better - do both. I'm a college dropout, and I constantly find things I'd have learned in college that'd be really useful to know - and it's far easier to find the time to learn about stuff when you're in college than it is when you're working full time.  That said, keep doing things in college. If your University has a networking society, join that, and become a sys admin for it. If it doesn't, start one, or offer to help build and run websites for other societies. All that kind of experience is useful to have. And have a final year project somewhat related to what you want to do. Build a monitoring system, or an automated build system, or something that you can go to sys admin interviews and talk about.  As well as that, spend your summers working in something vaguely related to IT. Even if it's just call centre tech support - that kind of stuff is all useful for getting a real™ job. And if you get a chance, grab a few certs - CCNA/JNCIA is worth doing, if only because getting exposure to networking gear is one of the more difficult things to do in college. If you've got spare cash (or better yet, someone else to pay for it), RHCSA or RHCE is worth having. I have no idea what MS certs are useful - I've only ever worked in a Linux/Unix/Networks shop.",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1357828138,"I didn't renounce Christianity that very day, of course. I was far too entrenched for that. I figured that since Jesus had so far been a fairly positive influence in my life, I might as well try giving him the benefit of the doubt. After all, I had plenty of friends and family who were still perfectly content with a religion whose history, whose underlying dogma they knew next to nothing about.   What's the fundamental difference between a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity implicitly out of misunderstanding, and a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity *explicitly*, out of disgust? If I was going to pick and choose the good parts, I was at least going to be honest with myself about that fact. So, for a time, I was an increasingly syncretic ""spiritual"" ""Christian"". As I modified my worldview to reflect my changing understanding of philosophy and of how the universe operated, I found that the term applied to me less and less appropriate. When I found I was holding on to it merely as a cultural formality, I discarded it.  There was a lot more to it than just the dogma, of course. I had a Personal Relationship With God™. I felt what I identified as God's Presence in my mind. I had ""received visions"". In my moments of deepest prayer or meditation, I was sure I could actually hear a voice talking back to me. It was only as I learned more about psychology that I understood that there were other possible explanations for all of those phenomena, and it was years before I admitted that those other explanations just plain *made more sense*.  I tried out all sorts of different metacosmologies, from polytheism to panentheism to deism to pure solipsism. Perhaps, I thought, Yahweh was a Caananite war-god (just one of many extremely powerful beings) who had had a really lucky streak and ended up far more powerful by wiping out his peers. Perhaps Jesus was a philosopher (who may have been a magician, a demigod, or simply a charlatan) who was attempting to civilize Yahweh's followers by degrees, by explaining things to them in terms they could understand, even if that required some insincere toadying to the tyrant.  Or perhaps the One True God was ineffable, and could only be understood for how he interacted with our universe. While every religion was almost certainly wrong, might there not still be an Ultimate Intelligence who can be communicated with and who ought to be venerated?  Or perhaps *I* was God, and just hadn't figured it out yet.  Or perhaps all this speculation was pointless, since it offered absolutely nothing to my understanding of the world. Perhaps I should stop wasting my time trying out different wild unfalsifiable speculations, and focus all that extra energy on understanding our beautiful, complex, *natural* world.  ---- I've read The Bible a couple of times since, knowing it was mostly Bullshit but attempting to appreciate it as literature. If you do that expecting an all powerful or all-loving monotheistic god, it's not going to make *any* sense, and all sorts of plot holes are going to jump right out at you. Though the text has been revised and censored and redacted over and over again, there's still plenty of evidence that the writers of they oldest books were polytheists, who simply thought that Yahweh was *their personal god*. Yahweh would not put nearly so much effort into exterminating other gods if they were mere fictions. Either they must have been legitimate rivals, or Yahweh was absurdly jealous and paranoid to beyond a pathological level. (Of course, since the second is a given, I suppose it could have been both. But I digress).  [Historical evidence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg)  bears [this hypothesis out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfFx9JTQl8)- the Old Testament shows heavy signs of editing during the Deuteronomist revision, in which worship of other gods was made illegal. It shows signs of even heavier editing by Second Isaiah during the Babylonian exile, with the intention to remove reference to any other gods as potential rivals.   There's also the problem of the God Mode Mary Sue, a being with the powers to solve any problem perfectly and instantly with no effort, and a personality that suggests that they want to see those problems solved. Either they immediately snap their fingers and solve the plot in five seconds flat, in which case the story is over and you can put it down and go read something better, or they *don't* do so, in which case the story **makes absolutely no sense**.  Forget the strong form of the Problem of Evil for a moment, which asks why suffering exists at all. Ask yourself instead why an even remotely good being would **actively commit** all the evil that is attributed to Yahweh if he could at all avoid it. Ask yourself why he so often seems unaware of something or has to inspect things in person, or why he seems unable to accomplish something, like defeat an army with Chariots of Iron in Judges 1:19. When you consider the literary character Yahweh like you would Paul Atredies or Hari Seldon or David Xanatos or Corwin of Amber– an immensely intelligent and powerful (but still limited) being who is playing a very long, very high stakes game, everything suddenly makes a lot more sense. He's still an asshole, but at least he's not a completely schizophrenic asshole. And, more importantly, he suddenly *works* as a literary character.  It becomes the story of one god's struggle to set himself above his rivals, and to lead his chosen people to greatness. It shows that god struggling with his own blood lust, and with the fact that he is *quite* mad with power. A couple of times, you think he might have learned a lesson and mellowed out a little, but then he loses control and goes right back to smiting. It's really quite tragic. It shows his people who variously genuinely appreciate the help their patron is giving them, or simply suffer with an extremely advanced case of Stockholm Syndrome as they are repeatedly forced to sing about how great he is.  Once Yahweh *makes sense* as a character,  then the story begins to make sense as well. If not for the various revisions that, in trying to fellate their god into omnipotence and omnibenevolence, introduced innumerable jarring contradictions and plot holes, it may well have been a masterpiece on the same order as the Iliad or the Bhaghavad Gita. And sometimes, I enjoy watching the twisted tale of this psychopath the same way I enjoy watching Hannibal Lector in *Red Dragon* or *The Silence of the Lambs*.   Is it *the Greatest* work of literature ever? Not even close. *The Lord of the Rings*, to name one book, surpasses it poetically, morally, mythically, and even in the consistency of its world building. But one cannot ignore the tremendous influence it has had on subsequent literature. If I were to bring Isaac Newton forward in time, he would know less about physics than pretty much any PhD physicist on the planet, but that fact would not diminish his unsurpassed contributions to the field. (That's not a perfect analogy- Newton was a mad genius, while most of the authors of the Bible were just *mad*- but it's close enough for my purposes)",™

From what I've read, the cans of tushonka were staples and included in military rations.  It could last a long time and didn't require refrigeration and was meat which made it popular.  This is the same reason why Spam® was/is so popular in the Philippines.  As long as the integrity of the can is protected, the meat won't spoil which is a plus in hot climates or where people can't afford refrigeration.  If you take a look at the OP's posted recipe, all the items used do not require refrigeration and they can be stored on shelves or in a root cellar.",®

Run the CPU (and GPU, FSB, RAM, etc. if applicable) at stock clocks, let the fans run at stock settings, and then start testing.  Custom stuff introduces variables that can have you running down blind alleys, and chasing your own tail as you try to figure out what the blazes is going on.  The factory is usually pretty good about calibrating everything to JustWork™ when things are untweaked, as they've run extensive testing to make it so prior to releasing the product.  if running everything back to defaults doesn't solve your problem, then start troubleshooting other things.  If everything runs within spec, then you've determined that your tweaks and overclocks may have been causing an issue, and you can start reapplying them one by one until you find the problematic one.    Also, when did you start noticing the problem? Has it always been like this, or did it occur after you did something, like update the BIOS? -- on that note, check to see if you have any BIOS updates available for your motherboard, and apply them after you've reset everything to stock settings, and had a look at what the CPU is doing.    Another thing to do is to (VERY CAREFULLY) give the heatsink the ""finger test"" -- if your CPU temperatures are as hot as they are, your heatsink should be pretty darned warm.  If it's not hot to the touch (and again, BE CAREFUL, these things -can- get hot enough to burn your finger) you could be getting faulty temperature readings, or have a poor thermal connection from your CPU to your heatsink.

t5_2qh1i,z0mbiegrl,1357847277,"**TL;DR I was stalked.** Edit: Formatted with paragraphs. Sorry, I didn't realize that just hitting ""enter"" wouldn't do what I wanted.  When I was 15 years old, I started attending a rather prestigious christian school. Yeah, yeah, uniforms and the whole bit. I'd grown up very sheltered, thus I wasn't really used to any kind of male attention, which I got, having developed early, in great quantities. Usually, I was either embarrased, or convinced that the guy(s) were playing some kind of joke on me. I didn't believe that I was really at all attractive. Then one day I found a note in my locker. It was a plain white index card, folded over and sealed with a little foil heart sticker. Inside, it simply said ""I think you're beautiful."" in careful print. That one got to me. It was very, very different from what I was used to... Basically leering, dirty comments, or propositions. That was sweet, innocent, and touching. I wondered who sent it, but didn't really have any way of finding out. So I stuck it in one of my notebooks and began to daydream about who might be my secret admirer. Was it the cute boy who gave me a pencil in my homeroom? Maybe my lab partner, who I found utterly adorable, even though he was a few years older than I was.   I was a ditzy, moony eyed teenage girl, dreaming of puppy love and maybe my first kiss. I took the note out whenever I was sad or upset and it always made me smile, but weeks had passed and I had no idea at all who had left it, nor had I gotten another one. I began to worry that maybe it wasn't really meant for me at all. Maybe someone had just put it in the wrong locker by mistake.   I was feeling down on myself and a little silly when I opened my locker one morning and - behold! - another note. Same little white index card, folded over and sealed with the same little foil heart. Trembling with excitement and anticipation, I carefully peeled one lobe of the heart up and read the following words: ""You are so lovely."" Like any dopey kid, I held the note to my chest, sighing, with a dumb grin on my face. 2 notes? It was no accident! Someone really liked ME. WOW! I made a dumb little scrap book thing and tucked the notes inside. I also began trying again in earnest to discern the identity of my secret admirer, but with only two unsigned notes as clues, I didn't get very far. I knew that whomever left the notes had to go to my school, that was obvious... But I didn't know much else. Maybe my admirer wasn't a guy at all. Damn. I didn't like mysteries I couldn't solve.    During this time, I had been building a friendship with a classmate, we'll call him Mark. Mark was a sophmore (I was a senior) but we had AP Latin together. We shared a free period as well, and sometimes hung out in the library, as we were both avid readers. Mark wasn't exactly my type, if a 15 year old can be said to have one, but he was sweet and we had many common interests. As we spent more time together, I started thinking that the notes were from him. Then one day, he confessed to ""liking"" me, and I had my answer! Or so I thought.   Mark told me how he felt over stale fundraising donuts eaten on the back wall behind the gym. I laughed, getting powdered sugar all over my stupid vest. ""Why the big charade?"" I asked, ""Why didn't you just tell me to begin with instead of leaving me those mysterious notes?"" Mark's face fell. ""What notes? I didn't send you any notes, Z0mbiegrl."" The mystery continues... but now I had a coconspirator. (Forgive my naivette. I was 15 and didn't realize how cruel it was to use someone who had just confessed to liking me, but that I wasn't really all that keen on to help me figure out who my secret admirer was, all the while hoping it was someone I really DID like...)   Another week, another note. ""I think about you always."". Awwww. Mark was starting to exhibit some signs of jealousy, which I brushed off. After all, we didn't know who the mystery notesender was. It could be *snort* Riley! (The token loaner/weird kid). Time went on, and I started losing focus in class. My grades didn't slip or anything, I made up for it, but as a normally attentive student, there was a clear shift in my attention. I went from listening intently to a talk on greek mythology to being called on and *gasp!* not knowing the anwser because I was too busy staring off into the distance and imagining my secret admirer as some sort of Tuxedo Mask-like figure, who would someday reveal himself and give me a rose and a dashing smile.    The next note said ""You smell like love itself."" Huh. I didn't know how to take that. I smelled like a combination of L'Oreal Kids Cherry shampoo and Cotton Candy Body Fantasies™. But, if that was what love smelled like, ok! The next note said ""I want to touch you."" Ok. That's a little creepy, but maybe in a kind of sweet way, right? Mark was freaked out and said I should go to the authorities, or at least the Head Mistress. I was dead set against that. I might scare my admirer away, if not get him/her in trouble. I didn't want to do that. So I tucked the note away with the others and waited for the next one.    I spent the night at a friend's house at some point. Typical teenage stuff. We watched stupid movies, gossiped about everything, ate junk food, and played with makeup. It was a great time, though by then I had begun to realize that I fit in better with the boys (Especially the video game/tabletop playing kind) than I ever would with the girls. When I left the following morning, something caught my eye - and stopped my heart. On my friend's mailbox, shimmering innocently in the 10:00 AM light, was a foil heart. Ok, now I was officially freaked out. I ran back inside and told my friend and her mother. Both of them seemed to think I was on something or overreacting. It was, after all, February. Heart stickers were everywhere. That one might've even been there for a while and I just hadn't noticed it. I dropped it, but inside I was still afraid.    Monday morning... another note. ""I want to taste you."" OK, this wasn't cool anymore. Not at all. But I didn't know what to do. I talked about it to Mark, who convinced me to approach the school's very own Safety Officer... Who proceeded to laugh at me. ""Kid, if I went after every hormone addled guy with a crush who didn't have the balls to admit it, I'd be here forever!"" Yeah. Ok.                   I stole one of my father's pocket knives and began carrying it around with me ""for protection"". (Yeah, like a dull 2"" blade is going to stop ANYONE.) I stopped going to my usual after school activities and hurred for my bus as soon as the bell rang. I always took the seat closest to the door in class, so I could see if anyone looked in, or looked suspicious as they passed by. And I found more heart stickers. It felt like they were everywhere I looked. I started having panic attacks when I saw them. On the window of my mother's car. On the table I sat at at lunch. On the door of the girls' room after I left (When it hadn't been there before).    Mark wanted me to go to the ""real cops"", but I couldn't make myself do it, not after the way Safety Guy had treated me. I didn't want to be laughed at again. It's a major issue for me, not to be taken seriously. So I did nothing. I suffered in silence. Until one day I came home and got the mail. Just like always... only this time, mixed in with the catalogs and bills was a plain white envelope sealed with one of those goddamned evil foil hearts. Inside it were pictures. Horrible pictures. Pictures of a grown man in various states of undress, doing things to himself. And a note. ""I bet your blood tastes like chocolate.""   I started screaming, which got my mother's attention. She called the police, who came out to the house and took a report. Luckily, I recognized the man in the photos, and they were more than enough evidence to arrest the slimeball. He was the school janitor.",™

t5_2s8bl,OliveBranchMLP,1357856919,"In My Opinion™...  The most immediate concern is the elimination of hate and the pursuit of peace through the use knowledge, logic, and rationality.  The most likely result is that those who watch it will gain a better understanding, and hopefully a better appreciation, of who bronies are and what they're all about. We're not expecting people to Join the Herd after watching the doc. If they do, awesome! If they don't, we're hoping that they'll at least tolerate bronies instead of judging them at first glance without really looking into what bronies are all about.  Idealistically, I'd like for the documentary to force people to confront and re-evaluate society's understanding of gender roles and stereotypes, and recognize them for the archaic notion that they are. Lauren put it very well in the trailer: ""We need to allow men to be sensitive and to care about one another, and not call them weak for *caring*."" Right now, men are relegated to this whole ""You have to be tough, you have to be unforgiving, you have to be strong, you have to be unyielding"" thing, and as a result, it's causing men to disassociate themselves from empathy and sensitivity, which are natural traits in the human psyche that society is telling us to abandon. It's in our evolutionary psychology to be sensitive and to have empathy for one another. My Little Pony is helping men reconnect with that side. I want people to recognize that, and value it.  Not only that, but we as a society associate femininity with weakness, or with a lack of quality. Whenever a man is being ""weak"" or showing signs of fear, we tell him to ""stop being such a girl!"" or, ""Man, you're just a little p&amp;%#y, grow some balls!"" Anyone mentions a show for little girls, and the immediate response is, ""oh it's crap, oh it's vapid, oh it has no plot, oh there's no depth, it's just mindless tea parties and fashion shows."" And quite frankly, that's BS. Women's entertainment is *not* stupid. Women are *not* weak. These notions need to be abandoned.    Women can be strong and independent and confident, just like men can be caring and sensitive and empathetic. This is what Lauren wanted to show with MLP, and anti-bronyism is getting in the way of this message.   But honestly, if this documentary convinces even *one* person to stop hating bronies, then it's done its job.",™

t5_2s9n5,Athildur,1357868048,"From personal experience, I know it's incredibly hard. I was very cowardly about it (imo), since I couldn't bring up the courage to start that particular conversation myself, I started wearing subtle symbols (i.e. the overlapping/intertwined ♂♂ on things like a rubber wrist band, or a small necklace). Eventually some people caught on (in this case, our backdoor neighbour lady while I was talking with her and my dad, and not much later my grandma while I was over for coffee) and it forced me into a position where I couldn't back out.  That moment was really weird. I think my heart may have skipped a beat or two, but then the truth was out and it instantly felt a lot better.  I didn't really have many good friends in high school (partly being an introvert geek/nerd, partly being a scared gay boy in the closet), but I did tell some old school friends while we were at camp (long story, we went to camp every year for years, organised by our old school and parents, new people joined every year from the same school, great fun).    Now that that little thing is over, if you dislike being the center of attention, talk to your friends one by one. It will lessen your anxiety and, even though it'll take longer, you'll still get there in the end.  Or, alternatively, if you don't want to be the center of attention, don't make a big deal of it (I know, in your head it will be a big deal either way). When they're talking of girlfriends, try to work up the courage to 'casually' mention your boyfriend. Chances are, if you're more casual about it and less confrontational (i.e. sitting them down and telling them, implying some immediate answer is required) it could be much less of a fuss.   Nobody would feel forced to immediately reply to that, and it immediately removes any of that 'are you sure it's not a phase' crap that some people might think about (even if they don't say it).  Either way, your feelings right now are a good sign, it means that you're  about ready to take that next step, and that's the most important part. Just try to take it at your own pace, but you should know that the end result will probably be the same whether you shout it out right now or find some subtle way to do it: Good friends won't make a fuss of it (other than perhaps 'why didn't you say sooner').

The Night City police try to intervene with the help of a member of an elite police called Psycho Squad.  Watch the video here.  &gt;“The teaser shows how the Psycho Squad might acquire a new member. The Psycho Squad specializes in combating “psychos” – individuals who overuse implants and substances that boost or otherwise alter the human body. There comes a point when they overdose on these innovations, and their bodies start to rebel against their biological body parts as well as against all things organic around them. Simply put, they start killing people, who they now derisively call “meatbags.”  &gt;When a psycho goes on the rampage, strange things can happen. There’s going to be a lot of carnage, so the psycho might be taken down by regular police, but they’re not always able to get the job done. When things spin out of control, they call in MAX-TAC (Maximum Force Tactical Division), popularly called the “Psycho Squad”. And these guys are exceptional, these guys are crack troops. The fact that they’re proud of that name tells you a bit about their mindset. They wear a badge with their official emblem on their right sleeve, but their left is reserved for their unofficial Psycho Squad emblem.

t5_2rch0,mojo_shoujo,1357884232,"&gt;I mean I know there are a lot of stories about how people have known since they were little, but I'm interested in the more complicated stories.  If by ""complicated stories"" you meant, ""stories involving incredible feats of denial,"" then I may have a story for you!  I'd never even admitted it to myself until recently. I've never been attracted to men, but I just assumed that was because I was a Good Christian Girl™, and good Christian girls are only supposed to be attracted to the one good Christian boy that God had set aside as their one true husband. Looking back, I'd had crushes on girls as early as third grade, but my feelings didn't even register as attraction at the time because I was taught that attraction was only possible between opposite genders. By the time I found out that gay people even existed (when I was in high school), the only thing I really knew about it was that all homos were supposed to be evil. I didn't think that I was evil, so I thought I couldn't be gay. I felt funny in the girls' locker room and whenever certain girls would talk to me, but I told myself that the reason I wanted to get close and hug them and write their names in my notebooks over and over again was because I just wanted to be *super best-friends,* not because I was gay. I mean, girls are just so hypnotically pretty that *everyone* stares at them, right? ...Right? I just assumed that my feelings couldn't be attraction because my crushes weren't boys.   It didn't finally click for me until I became an atheist. I was talking to a group of friends, and they started casually chatting about men's butts. I was absolutely perplexed. My immediate thought was, ""Wait, this is a thing that people actually do? Why would anyone look at men's butts when ladies' butts are so much better-- oh. OH."" But even though I was okay with other people being gay, I still didn't really believe that I could be gay. Or, rather, *should* be. So, whenever I'd realize I was crushing on a girl, I'd fervently hope that it would go away if I hated myself enough. Eventually it reached a point where I realized what I was doing was dishonest, self-destructive, and ridiculous, so thankfully I'm over that now.   tl;dr: butts",™

She said something back and had a sudden realization of who it was and whispered (trying not to draw attention) to her that she really admired her work and thought she was an amazing person. They ended up walking around the zoo for a while and parted ways at the end of the day, she got a hug and Taylor signed her zoo program. She said it was one of the best and most surreal moments of her life.  If I met her I think I would just say how much I admired her work, if she was enjoying being in the country and that I would be happy to show her around the city from a locals point of view if she ever wanted to.   She seems like a really genuine person who seems relatively approachable as long as you respect her privacy and didn't make her feel uncomfortable.

The trouble is that $100 territory is populated with 2-year old used phones that are using using old Android versions with subpar user experience. I'd rather recommend recent phones that are designed with some compromises. The top four national carriers are not offering any decent prepaid phones. You have to go to the carriers that specialize in prepaid phones: MetroPCS, Virgin Mobil and Boost.   I looked through what they offer right now:  * MetroPCS [LG Motion 4G](http://www.metropcs.com/metro/detail/LG+Motion%E2%84%A2+4G/LGMS770#.UO-1jInjlEA) for $50 plus $40 plan (if you don't stream audio and video on mobile connection that should be enough data, you can switch later to $50 plan with more data) * Virgin Mobile [HTC ONE V](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/shop/cell-phones/htc-one-v-phone/features/) for $120 plus a plan with as many minutes as you need (their plans have pretty big amount of data so you don't need to worry about it) * Boost Samsung Galaxy Rush, but I think it's worse than MetroPCS LG Motion™ 4G.  The trouble with Virgin Mobile and Boost and their phones is that they run on the slow oversold Sprint 3G network. ~~So that leaves you with MetroPCS LG Motion 4G as the best candidate.~~ Scratch that. I realized that MetroPCS is roaming on Sprint in Tallahassee, FL (they call it Extended Home Area), and they will terminate your account if you spend most of the time in Extended Home Area.

t5_2qh1i,SecretAgentX9,1357929489,"**Please, nobody upvote me. I just wanted to make an easier-to-read version (paragraph breaks semi-arbitrary)**:  When I was 15 years old, I started attending a rather prestigious christian school. Yeah, yeah, uniforms and the whole bit. I'd grown up very sheltered, thus I wasn't really used to any kind of male attention, which I got, having developed early, in great quantities. Usually, I was either embarrased, or convinced that the guy(s) were playing some kind of joke on me. I didn't believe that I was really at all attractive.   Then one day I found a note in my locker. It was a plain white index card, folded over and sealed with a little foil heart sticker. Inside, it simply said ""I think you're beautiful."" in careful print. That one got to me. It was very, very different from what I was used to... Basically leering, dirty comments, or propositions. That was sweet, innocent, and touching. I wondered who sent it, but didn't really have any way of finding out. So I stuck it in one of my notebooks and began to daydream about who might be my secret admirer.   Was it the cute boy who gave me a pencil in my homeroom? Maybe my lab partner, who I found utterly adorable, even though he was a few years older than I was.   I was a ditzy, moony eyed teenage girl, dreaming of puppy love and maybe my first kiss. I took the note out whenever I was sad or upset and it always made me smile, but weeks had passed and I had no idea at all who had left it, nor had I gotten another one. I began to worry that maybe it wasn't really meant for me at all. Maybe someone had just put it in the wrong locker by mistake.   I was feeling down on myself and a little silly when I opened my locker one morning and - behold! - another note. Same little white index card, folded over and sealed with the same little foil heart. Trembling with excitement and anticipation, I carefully peeled one lobe of the heart up and read the following words: ""You are so lovely.""   Like any dopey kid, I held the note to my chest, sighing, with a dumb grin on my face. 2 notes? It was no accident! Someone really liked ME. WOW! I made a dumb little scrap book thing and tucked the notes inside. I also began trying again in earnest to discern the identity of my secret admirer, but with only two unsigned notes as clues, I didn't get very far.   I knew that whomever left the notes had to go to my school, that was obvious... But I didn't know much else. Maybe my admirer wasn't a guy at all. Damn. I didn't like mysteries I couldn't solve.   During this time, I had been building a friendship with a classmate, we'll call him Mark. Mark was a sophmore (I was a senior) but we had AP Latin together. We shared a free period as well, and sometimes hung out in the library, as we were both avid readers. Mark wasn't exactly my type, if a 15 year old can be said to have one, but he was sweet and we had many common interests. As we spent more time together, I started thinking that the notes were from him.   Then one day, he confessed to ""liking"" me, and I had my answer! Or so I thought. He told me how he felt over stale fundraising donuts eaten on the back wall behind the gym. I laughed, getting powdered sugar all over my stupid vest.   ""Why the big charade?"" I asked, ""Why didn't you just tell me to begin with instead of leaving me those mysterious notes?"" Mark's face fell.   ""What notes? I didn't send you any notes, Z0mbiegrl.""   The mystery continues... but now I had a coconspirator. (Forgive my naivette. I was 15 and didn't realize how cruel it was to use someone who had just confessed to liking me, but that I wasn't really all that keen on to help me figure out who my secret admirer was, all the while hoping it was someone I really DID like...)   Another week, another note. ""I think about you always."". Awwww. Mark was starting to exhibit some signs of jealousy, which I brushed off. After all, we didn't know who the mystery notesender was. It could be snort Riley! (The token loaner/weird kid).   Time went on, and I started losing focus in class. My grades didn't slip or anything, I made up for it, but as a normally attentive student, there was a clear shift in my attention. I went from listening intently to a talk on greek mythology to being called on and gasp! not knowing the anwser because I was too busy staring off into the distance and imagining my secret admirer as some sort of Tuxedo Mask-like figure, who would someday reveal himself and give me a rose and a dashing smile.   The next note said ""You smell like love itself."" Huh. I didn't know how to take that. I smelled like a combination of L'Oreal Kids Cherry shampoo and Cotton Candy Body Fantasies™. But, if that was what love smelled like, ok!   The next note said ""I want to touch you."" Ok. That's a little creepy, but maybe in a kind of sweet way, right? Mark was freaked out and said I should go to the authorities, or at least the Head Mistress. I was dead set against that. I might scare my admirer away, if not get him/her in trouble. I didn't want to do that. So I tucked the note away with the others and waited for the next one.   I spent the night at a friend's house at some point. Typical teenage stuff. We watched stupid movies, gossiped about everything, ate junk food, and played with makeup. It was a great time, though by then I had begun to realize that I fit in better with the boys (Especially the video game/tabletop playing kind) than I ever would with the girls.   When I left the following morning, something caught my eye - and stopped my heart. On my friend's mailbox, shimmering innocently in the 10:00 AM light, was a foil heart. Ok, now I was officially freaked out. I ran back inside and told my friend and her mother. Both of them seemed to think I was on something or overreacting. It was, after all, February. Heart stickers were everywhere. That one might've even been there for a while and I just hadn't noticed it. I dropped it, but inside I was still afraid.   Monday morning... another note. ""I want to taste you."" OK, this wasn't cool anymore. Not at all. But I didn't know what to do. I talked about it to Mark, who convinced me to approach the school's very own Safety Officer... Who proceeded to laugh at me.   ""Kid, if I went after every hormone addled guy with a crush who didn't have the balls to admit it, I'd be here forever!""   Yeah. Ok.   I stole one of my father's pocket knives and began carrying it around with me ""for protection"". (Yeah, like a dull 2"" blade is going to stop ANYONE.)   I stopped going to my usual after school activities and hurred for my bus as soon as the bell rang. I always took the seat closest to the door in class, so I could see if anyone looked in, or looked suspicious as they passed by. And I found more heart stickers. It felt like they were everywhere I looked. I started having panic attacks when I saw them.   On the window of my mother's car. On the table I sat at at lunch. On the door of the girls' room after I left (When it hadn't been there before).   Mark wanted me to go to the ""real cops"", but I couldn't make myself do it, not after the way Safety Guy had treated me. I didn't want to be laughed at again. It's a major issue for me, not to be taken seriously. So I did nothing. I suffered in silence.   Until one day I came home and got the mail. Just like always... only this time, mixed in with the catalogs and bills was a plain white envelope sealed with one of those goddamned evil foil hearts. Inside it were pictures. Horrible pictures. Pictures of a grown man in various states of undress, doing things to himself. And a note. ""I bet your blood tastes like chocolate.""   I started screaming, which got my mother's attention. She called the police, who came out to the house and took a report. Luckily, I recognized the man in the photos, and they were more than enough evidence to arrest the slimeball.   He was the school janitor.",™

The reward amount was based on activity in all accounts reporting under the primary owner's Social Security number. The account must have been opened on or before December 31, 2012 and remained open through January 11, 2013 to receive the Relationship Reward.  Relationship Reward Calculation Periods: Transaction activity must have occurred as defined above under Reward Amounts for Eligible Business Products and Services. Share dividends earned and interest paid calculations were based on the 2012 calendar year.  Limitations &amp; Exclusions: Only one reward will be paid for eligible products/services per eligible primary account owner. If a reward was earned by a Business account, it will be rewarded separately. A Relationship Reward totaling less than 10 dollars ($10.00) will not be awarded. Members who have previously caused PSECU a financial loss will not receive a Reward. Also, accounts with any loan more than 22 days past due, and accounts with any liens and holds will not receive a Reward.  Reporting for Taxes: The Relationship Reward is reportable under the primary account owner’s Social Security Number on IRS Form 1099-INT and 1099-MISC for 2013. All share dividends earned (portions of Relationship Reward earned from share dividends paid) will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT.  Non-share Relationship Reward earned from loan balances and services will be reported on IRS Form 1099-MISC, if $600 or more is accumulated for the 2013 year. We are not tax experts and cannot offer tax advice. Should you have any questions regarding the tax implications regarding this Reward, please contact your tax advisor.  Reading Your Statement: See below for an example of how the 2012 Relationship Reward will be shown on your January 2013 account statement. The Reward appears in your Regular (S1) share.",®

But, in her eyes I see the hurt And, if no body else does I care When you’re that young You don’t know it’s wrong The man whose suppose to keep you Safe from all harm Her first boyfriend… Her momma’s man Words unspoken Can never mend She didn’t tell me She was molested as a child She hides from herself Fakes a broken smile Her man Only put his mouth on her tiny little lips Creating a sensation She grew accustom to at two She gave him hand service at four When she turned six… Daddy said… we could play no more but… It was her six grade teacher Who needed to be stroked at recess and at lunch The hands of a child The stroke of a pro Inside the elementary classroom Her virginity broke at 14 By 16 she was a Sex Addict Queen You couldn’t turn her off Like a wild stallion who wouldn’t be bucked. She was 18 before she knew She was not obligated To give herself to every man Who wanted to screw It had been taken from her Since the age of only two She was 21 when she locked down The powers within At RIU she studied the Psychology of Men Now commanding them To get on their knees and beg Vowing never let a man Get inside her head Daddy’s Little Girl Lost in a world of betrayal He’ll never know the intensity of hurt He’ll never feel the empty pain He’ll never know the lack of trust She has in each and every man It’s just a sex game Who’s the master?

He hires an assassin to take out the leaders of 1- and 2-Alpha, and then instates his own stooges as their leaders. The people, concerned about the death of their liberties, hold a council meeting to try to find a peaceful solution. But it’s broken up by armed guards, and a lot of people are trampled to death or shot.  I wish I could explain it better but I’m not a professor, and quite honestly I don’t think I’ll ever be one because I think they’re gross. One of my high school friends is a professor now and all he ever does is pick his butthole and write absurdist literature. Someday I will go visit him but I need to save up money. I lost most of my savings in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and need to earn it back ASAP. Where would you suggest that I find work?

t5_2s7po,uselessstolencomment,1357973055,"Think of it like a waterslide:  Waterslides are 100-200 metres long and twist and turn a lot. Additionally, most waterslides are part of larger setups that include 3-4 waterslides of similar length. So in essence, a lifeguard watching a waterslide must patrol up to 800 metres of slide. That’s more than most police officers have to deal with.  Now imagine that everyone says to themselves, “Fuck the lifeguards. We’re rational and intelligent people, and we know how to stay safe. We can go down fucking waterslides by ourselves.” They grab him by the genitals and toss him off the platform, snapping his spine in two and cracking his skull like a poorly made bowling pin.  (Just for context, let’s say this is all happening at Waterworld™ in Racine, Wisconsin. My cousin Lenny worked there one summer and said that it made him lose his faith in humanity. Then again Lenny’s kind of a head case so I don’t know if he should talk. One time he got super drunk and thought it would be funny to see how fast his car could go in reverse. He drove straight into an elm tree which fell on top of his neighbor’s—who happens to be Kobe Bryant—house. Kobe was mostly cool about it, but his wife got really pissed and Lenny had to shell out $500 to get some immigrant to come fix it—his words, not mine.)  Now that the people control the waterslide, they delegate two task forces: 1-Alpha, in charge of general maintenance and 2-Alpha, who take care of more technical issues. But this is a classic example of the Prisoner’s Dilemma: 1-Alpha will always insist that something is technical and outside their realm of knowledge, while 2-Alpha says that everything is simple and beneath them. To solve this problem, they form a third task force, 2-Beta, which is headed by Christopher Walken, who is visiting Waterworld with his two children.  As you might expect, Walken shakes things up.

You should check in with a Naturapath or MD to confirm your leaky gut syndrome and then research effective lifestyles to heal the LGS.   There is a strong chance you are sensitive to gluten or have celiac. You should see a doctor and get tested to confirm this.  Source: my brother and I both suffer from psoriasis (30%+ of skin covered) and are mildly (me) and heavily (him) sensitive to gluten. When we eat gluten or sugar, it makes us feel mentally foggy, panicked, neurotic, manic.  Until we realized the connection, it was hell. Imagine eating a sandwich and then f-r-e-a-k-i-n-g out from an out of control panic attack.  From medical testing (something any MD, naturopath, etc can do), we discovered that we both are sensitive to gluten. Eating it cause a panic attack. As does sugar.   Again, OP, this is probably dietary, not just psychological. The best bet is to go to a naturopath / medical doctor and tell them you want to be tested for a gluten sensitivity. My brother and I went through a dozen doctors before we found one who specialized in gluten intolerance / sensitivity who referred us to the right tests and helped us get on a dietary plan that eliminated gluten.

Since they own it, and the government gives them special allowances to build infrastructure for the public good, they are required to allow access to their competitors.    These CLEC companies often can provide the same service for cheaper, or if they are smart they have built their own network infrastructure and can provide it for much less, much faster, and from a local company.  Ask if they are a ""facilities-based"" or ""reseller"" CLEC.  The reseller type are mostly just marketing companies while the facilities-based ones have actually built their own network and hand off the phone calls or data to the ILEC from their own equipment collocated within the ILEC's facilities.",®

t5_2qh36,anvsdt,1358026860,"&gt;I am often asked if this has a pronunciation and although I don’t know of an agreed term, I have heard: “spaceship operator”, “starship operator”, “angle bum.”↩  ""Apply"". It's even called `ap` for monads. Thinking of it as (impure/modal/generalized) application makes sense for at least five reasons: (where `pure = return`, `apply = &lt;*&gt;`)    - `apply` for `Identity` is `($)`    - `apply (pure id) = id` means ""applying the pure identity function is the identity`    - `apply (pure f) (pure x) = pure (f x)` means ""applying a pure function to a pure value is the same as the pure result of just applying the function to the value"".  - `(&lt;*&gt; pure x) = apply (pure ($ x))` means ""applying to pure value is the same as purely applying to it"".  - `pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)` means ""pure composition of impure functions gives usual composition, but with impure application"".    It's easier to see with an operator:   `(f &lt;.&gt; g) x = f &lt;*&gt; (g &lt;*&gt; x)`",↩

Freeyearwow this is such a selfless thing you’re doing and I have come out from lurking in the hopes of being able to go back into the world I have been escaping to for the last 8 years.  I have met so many wonderful people in game and was beginning to be disheartened as this day came closer and closer. In the past week I have grinded out as much as I could in order to fulfill all those “I’ll get that rare someday” notions before I get locked out of my account.   I have been playing since vanilla and remember all the old school content like it was yesterday. Wow has been my refuge and no matter what stressed me irl I’d be able to kick it in game and go on autopilot to recharge.  I’ve recently been let go from an internship so atm I’m looking for positions while I’m at school. Unfortunately I can no longer justify the subscription fee and so am here to try for the game card. I love the game, plain and simple.   I play a frost mage, frost dk, and holy priest. All my favorite machinima are throwbacks that range from The Illegal Danish, to the Dark Requiem movies like Anh’Qiraj. I will never forget the first time I walked into Onyxia’s lair and accidently pulled not knowing that apparently walking towards the sleeping dragon would make her unhappy (I have learned to study up before fights ever since lol). I’m a rare hunter and each time NPC scan pings I get a mini-heart attack – two of the most promising adrenaline rushes subsequently from the Time- lost proto drake and Aeonaxx (I’m a dedicated farmer ☺). By far the worst 5 man was the Halls of Reflection! Do you remember all the people who dropped from group when they saw that exasperating wallpaper load up? I do.   Reddit, I don’t know what else I can say. I have had a ton of amazing late nights in this world, with some of the most amazing people around our world. I legitimately love this game and would be immeasurably grateful for another year to take in all it has to offer. Even 8 years in, I still haven’t scraped the surface of the world of warcraft. ",☺

They only do 6 shades so you buy two and mix your own (means a completely perfect match, though buying two does suck).   But the best things really are: it's incredibly quick to put on, it covers basically everything (I no longer use concealer at all), it blends incredibly easily, it does not slide off at all compared to everything else I've tried (which ranges from Kevyn Aucoin to Chantecaille to Laura Mercier), and it just looks beautiful!!  I feel like an advert or a rep or something; I'm not!

It really is astounding how many guys just COMPLETELY ignore those universally agreed-upon rules!  Is it because they don't believe chicks really DO like tall, handsome men?  Because, Guys -- We DO!  It's no urban myth.  We honestly like that tall, good-lookin type....  But back to tall, handsome Jason here.  You didn't say in which way things aren't working now -- Do you mean you get fewer responses to messages you send?  Or fewer initial contacts from women?  Or are you getting first but not second dates, now, or what?  I think your profile's fantastic, but if it's not getting the results, I can throw out a few practical tips that might help....  1.  Don't remove the Tangiers story.  Why?  You come up of it sparkly clean and fluffy fresh.  I actually think you should expand on it a bit, since you say it tells a lot about you.  What popped up in my mind was, if you didn't realize this lady was a prostitute, what did you think was going on?  She was just hitting on you, and you weren't interested?  Maybe it makes you look..... aloof?  Nah.  I don't know -- as is or expanded, I don't think it's a big deal.  But since you asked....  2.  I agree with you, that the ""Six Things"" essay is unappealing.  Several others, too..... But still -- you don't want to seem like a bad sport, you know?  I'd say either leave it blank (as then it gets left out all together, I think?), or register your dislike of it, but then still put something down.  Anything.  You can list absurd shit (Oddly Pigmented Polliwogs, Coelacanthes, my Urethra...); or you can go all meta and deep (Couldn't go without questions like this one, etc etc); or you can Stick It to the Man© by not doing six - girls love rough, rebel edginess like that....!  3.  I know -- you're burned out by the time you get there, but I think that ""Message Me If"" section is really key.  For ladies who've read up til that point, and might like to contact you, but are a little shy, give em a hand!  Say something that sounds welcoming, like you WANT to get messages.  You can use the classic new-guy-in-town stuff (""Message me if you know where to get great Ethiopian food/see live jazz/find mime flashmobs/etc around here""); or invite THEIR stories (""Message me if you were ever mistaken for a prostitute while vacationing in Tangiers!"" ...eh, maybe not....)  4.  And finally, I just saw a thread about this, but I totally agree -- WRITE A SECOND TIME, if you don't hear back initially.  I space responding to someone, sometimes, and then they disappear, knocked off the front page by a bunch that there's no chance I'm responding to.  Just make sure there's not the tiniest hint of reproach for not answering before.  Okay..... now I'm done.  Good luck!",©

t5_2qyt6,watermark0n,1358089577,"SRS does have a restrictive commenting policy. Find issue with the offensiveness of a post at all gets you banned. Of course, the stated reason is that SRS is somewhat self-consciously attempting to be a circlejerk; it may seem fascist, but I think most must acknowledge that the discussion would be mostly endless arguments with concern trolls disputing the most obvious of bigotry. It does wind up with an often very low bar for accusations of offensiveness, but, well, it is supposed to be a circlejerk. And it does sometimes wind up highlighting simply astounding bits of racism and sexism being upvoted. And you'd have to simply have no common sense to deny that there's a lot of really astounding bigotry on here; fortunately, reddit loves people with no common sense, seriously, give me the most obviously, uncontroversial position in the world (""baby-rapers are a bad thing for society, and a person committing such a crime should receive some form of punishment"") and I'll give you some contrarian disputing it adn getting upvoted for it. Plus, even with that the reputation is overblown a bit, most often some guy comes on and posts a long list of MRA cliches, gets banned, and then gets furious about this ""logic"" being so casually thrust aside, or doesn't even get that far, just posts a lot of slurs.   Too often I so many on the internet are like adult-sized children, they believe they have an indisputable right to do anything that pleases them. Someone makes a community and, knowing that if it were fully open, it would be flooded with members until its demographics and opinions pretty much conformed to that of on every other part of reddit, they instead seek a safe zone where those of the minority opinion can discuss things. ""They put up a set of rules, and say, hey, if you do this stuff, we're gonna ban you. Go somewhere else."" So, our young, white, upper middle class male hero, fresh off of having finished Atlas Shrugged* stumbles upon this community, senses ""There is something in the world I'm not allowed to do?!"", and decides to deliver up a good 'ole helping of logic™ to set them straight. Wouldn't you know that logic™ consists of the regurgitating cliches you've memorized from elsewhere? Well, then he gets banned. Which is... just what they said they'd do. He's astounded. In a private forum someone has set up, in which they posted some set of rules, and he'd ignored them, they carried through with the penalties for ignoring the rules just exactly as they had promised beforehand. He's incensed. What is the world coming to? They're ""justification"" is merely that they'd get flooded with and homogenized with the rest of reddit if they allowed an open posting policy, which is absolutely true. But that only takes the needs of the community into account! He is an individual, and has the right to do whatever he wants! He and other trolls were sent by God on a mission to enlighten the world with their message, and here is one little cesspool that he cannot touch, merely because all he wants to do is to have a rational discussion about how he suffers under the oppression of it being socially unacceptable for him to say the n word, and how Chinese people and Arabs are like rats (which isn't racism, because it's **true**). And now he cannot do so in a subreddit specifically and self-consciously set up not to allow such things, simply because they dominate the rest of the internet. So, he goes and whines, bitches, and moans on some subreddit where his ilk dominate (anywhere, basically). And little changed in the world that day.   *Perhaps this is even the me of five years ago. When they invent time machines, the first thing I'm going to do is find the 17 year old me and punch him in the face. ",™

BSD allows closed forks, so it would be totally possible to have a closed source Winix or Nixdows or windows 20xx or whatever you decide to call it.

From my experience as an SEO, the following conditions are necessary but not sufficient to trigger:  * Have a Wikipedia page. (Bonus points: Associate your page with a prominent local/industry category such as, ""Hotels Completed in 1996,"" or ""Buildings and structures in Chicago, Illinois.""  Extra bonus points: List your geocoordinates.) * Have a Google+ page, and add images to it. * Have a Panoramio account set up for your URL, and add images to it.  (Bonus points: Geotag them.) * Sounds obvious, but own your respective pages on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook and keep 'em reasonably fresh. * Be proactive about your company's appearance in directories like YellowPages.com, CitySearch.com, Yelp.com, etc. Aim for as much consistency as you can manage (i.e. if '503 6th Street', ok, but revise profiles that say '503 Sixth Street', and use a directory management service like Yext.com or GetListed.org if your time is valuable enough).  The photos are usually sourced from one of either (a) open source networks like Wikipedia, or (b) Google-owned networks like Google+ or Panoramio.  Often they are sourced from both.  The decision to grant a particular Brand an enhanced SERP or not seems to reflect a combination of social authentication factors (i.e. Twitter,  Wikipedia) and local directory citations: if YellowPages and CitySearch both have no record of you existing at 503 6th Street, Google is unlikely to give you the enhanced SERP.

t5_2qh6c,FieldsofBlue,1358161885,"1. Is that really a misconception if lots of people believe it? Heck, that's exactly the sort of thing that the churches I went too with my mother and sister taught when I was a child &amp; young teen. It's precisely this teaching that made me disbelieve in Christianity. The Christianity I've observed since going to church has always been about going to heaven or hell; that's always been the bottom line. Living your life isn't important besides how you live it, and it's only a means to an end when you die and are judged according to the sin list. I know there are lots of varieties/sects and exceptions, I just don't think the hell believers are in the minority.   2. Agreed! I've certainly observed this numerous times here when people ask if X is a sin and people reply with ""everything is a sin, which is why we repent/pray/ask for forgiveness."" I just wish people would answer these questions with that more often, rather then saying ""Of course that's a sin."" At the very least, it's a misleading answer.   3. Similarly to #1, I've been told that I deserve hell almost every single time that I've had a religion discussion with a Christian. I understand that the statement doesn't necessarily mean they hold me in contempt, but it hasn't appeared so scarce to me that it could be considered a misconception. And, again, I do fully understand that there are plenty of exceptions to this trend, I simply haven't seen it yet. Also, it's not really fair to be angry at people when you've told them they're doomed to damnation unless they believe in Jesus Christ &amp; god. From a non-believer's perspective, it would be like me saying you're going to hell for not believing Doctor Who is real. To anyone who doesn't believe in Christianity, you're just taking a book too literally.  Anyways, I know nobody asked for my response, but I just felt like adding a bit too this discussion. ♥",♥

t5_2qm4e,Sir_Thomas_Young,1358166291,"To clarify, the term perspective in physics has nothing to do with cognitive abilities. Rather, it is the change in subjective experience of forces do to different reference frames. If we are excellerating away from Earth at different speeds, we will experience the pull of gravity differently.  Alternately, if one of us is flying AWAY from a meteor, while the other one rushes TOWARD it, we will both be hit. But the relative velocity due to our different perspectives means one of us (the one fleeing) feels less force.   How does this fit in with our photon? As other comments have pointed out, the velocity of light through a vacuum (c) (but not ©), remains constant REGARDLESS OF OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE. Which is a bit mind blowing. It's as if the meteor will hit us BOTH at the same speed regardless of how fast we move. (An important thing to note here is the integrated nature of space and time - acceleration through one of them means deceleration through the other.)  What does this mean? It means that photons are the fastest thing in the universe and, due to Lorentz transformations, DON'T experience time at all. Their v(space)=c and v(time)=0. From the perspective of the photon, it exists as a contiguous ray or wave from the point it was emitted to the point it becomes absorbed. We, who travel slower than c, observe it at distinct points and measure it's speed as c, but always with reference to our frame.  How does this happen? We don't rightly know, except that it is a universal phenomena that underlies all of non-classical physics. ",©

t5_2qstm,Rexev,1358195579,"Here's the first email from the instructor.  Based on this, this course is looking pretty good!   **Welcome!**  Hello everyone! My name is Avi Pai and I am a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®). I am VERY excited to be your tour guide into the world of personal finance! I’ve been a Certified Financial Planner since 2005 and I have been teaching courses in personal finance since 2006. I thought I taught a lot of people before - probably close to 200 students - but nothing close to this course! As I’m typing this, I’m being told that there are over 80,000 of you enrolled! There are more students in this course than people at a sold-out home game for the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Stadium!  I am thrilled and honored to be teaching this and I hope to cover some serious ground. I commend you all in taking a serious step in trying to learn more about finances. Let me tell you a few things up front:  * As the Beatles said: “Money can’t get everything, it’s true.” In other words, money cannot buy happiness! It can only provide some options financially. Those that think that winning the lottery is a dream come true should see how many lottery winners wish they never bought a ticket.  * Money is NOT the root of all evil (as nothing is truly the ROOT of all evil). People can do some evil things for money though! * Both lack of money and too much money bring different problems. Always remember to separate your problems financially and otherwise. And, of course, be thankful for what you have. * I say all this because it’s important to know this course may not solve all of life’s problems and extinguish all your stress. If you feel you’re having issues, consult with a qualified and educated financial planner, tax advisor, attorney (estate, tax, bankruptcy, etc.), therapist, medical practitioner, or any other qualified and licensed professional.  **This course is on the Internet - so use the Internet!**  Unfortunately, I cannot interact with you directly. However, we truly do live in the information age! With all the resources at our fingertips, I would suggest that you become well acquainted with your favorite search engine. I will give you an unpaid and unsolicited endorsement for Google as that’s what I use on a daily basis. Please do beware of the source of the information. It may be outdated or just downright incorrect. I would strongly encourage you to look for certain sites over others. Please see the last part of this announcement for my suggestions when searching the internet. Although I have provided some suggestions below, this is not anything close to an exhaustive list of all the great online resources. Feel free to look around and find a great source of information. But, as I stress below, make sure to verify the information.  I will try to make learning this as fun and interactive as possible, but please note that you shouldn’t try to email me or any of the other course assistants for help. I would personally LOVE to be able to help you, but there are far too many of you to make this humanly possible, so I will not be able to reply.  **Use the discussion forums!**  Communicate freely with your fellow students! If you have a question, it’s highly possible that someone else does too! In fact, you may be doing someone else a favor by asking for yourself. The discussion forums are designed to help you understand the materials better.   The course material is meant to be helpful but also serve as a springboard for discussion. Like I said above, I want you to converse amongst each other to further your learning and learn from one another. Share personal experiences! You may know more about a single topic than someone else and your knowledge may help someone else! Please feel free to speak freely and share any information you feel pertinent.   **Discussion etiquette:**  * I’d like to politely ask that you refrain from introducing very pointed political or religious commentary.  * Please keep conversations productive and do not resort to insulting someone else’s views, intelligence, or otherwise. It’s assumed we’re all adults here! On the other hand, spirited debate on philosophical differences is welcome! * Please do not allude to test questions (even after the test) and don’t spoil any surprises!  **What should I know about this course and/or prerequisites?**  I think it’s important to know that the information provided comes from a U.S. point of view. Although we certainly welcome students from outside of the United States, it’s important to know that information regarding our stock market, Social Security retirement system, Medicare, federal and state tax system, and all laws and regulations may only apply to citizens and residents of the United States. For instance, Canada may have a lot in common with our system but the U.S. does not have a government-sponsored healthcare system for all citizens and I’m not aware of a 401k-like account in Canada. Also, in the United States, many transfers between retirement accounts are not a taxable event but I do not know of a way to perform a tax-free transfer between retirement accounts of two different countries even for the same citizen.  There aren’t any real prerequisites for this course, but the information presented does assume that you are familiar with basic math; some financial concepts may be new to you. As a development team, we have tried to break down things to basic building blocks as best we can. However, it’s possible that we define a term very briefly and re-use it often. If you find yourself lost on a term or concept, I feel confident Google or Investopedia.com’s glossary will help out!  It’s important to note that this course is meant to be general and helpful. Although it’s not “lowest common denominator information, you won’t walk away ready for the Certified Financial Planner exam or to be a money manager on Wall Street.  **What is the course format?**  This course consists of online lessons within distinct topical modules. The lessons contains brief explanatory videos that are accompanied by text, worksheets, and exercises. Please read below about some recommendations for completing the full course.   Each module contains from one to six lessons. The lessons are arranged so they can be accessed individually. The modules on Taxation, Investing, College Planning and Estate Planning are self-contained single lessons. The lessons in the other four modules are intended to work together to cover the major topic.  You can read through Modules 1 and 2, work through the exercises, and then proceed to a topic of your choice. Doing this will give you a good grounding in setting savings goals and understanding your current financial situation as well as covering your interests.   **You can choose one of three ways to go through this course:**  1.	You can start with Module 1 and proceed through all of the modules and lessons sequentially until you reach the end. This will provide you with a very thorough basic background in financial planning.  2.	You can read through Modules 1 &amp; 2, work through the exercises or not, and then proceed to a topic of your choice. Doing this will give you a good grounding in setting savings goals and understanding your current financial situation as well as covering your interests.   3.	You can pick and choose between modules and only view those that interest you. This will give you a basic understanding of what you need to do to plan for your particular goals.   **What about books and materials?**  Of course, there will be some recommended reading. We will be utilizing the Personal Financial Planning Open Courseware created at the University of California - Irvine. This material is self-paced ""online learning"" in the traditional sense. You can access this by going here [http://learn.uci.edu/oo/getDemoPage.php?course=AR0102092&amp;lesson=1&amp;topic=1&amp;page=1]. These materials are also available here [http://learn.uci.edu/oo/getDemoPage.php?course=OC0102093&amp;lesson=1&amp;topic=1&amp;page=1] in Spanish.   As for outside reading, there are hundreds of books in the world about personal finance. Many of them are good, but many of them have heavy biases and are trying to sell you something (or sell more books with sensationalized information). With any book, be leery of the author. Ultimately, most of them are neutral enough that they’ll steer you in an overall positive direction. However, I feel this course’s online materials provide a much better (and unbiased) presentation of the information. ",®

In this article, the author links to the following studies, all of which are credible demonstrations of the risks of bacon and red meat:  Paluszkiewicz P, SmoliÅ""ska K, DÄ™biÅ""ska I, Turski WA. ""Main dietary compounds and pancreatic cancer risk. The quantitative analysis of case-control and cohort studies."" Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Feb;36(1):60-7.

What he is criticizing is not the strength of studies like the ones above. He is criticizing the need that some researchers feel to not be honest when their study simply does not give them a strong conclusion like those,   &gt; there are lots of studies out there that claim to find a link, either for increased risk or a protective effect, between this food or that ingredient and cancer, but very few of them actually provide convincing support for their hypothesis.  and he is criticizing the compulsion that media and quack types feel to grab hold of weaker studies and stick them with sensational headlines to proclaim that *this!* *This right here!* is the answer to the cancer problem instead of recognizing that nutrition is an evolving field of research.  He goes on to say,  &gt;Unfortunately, in almost the mirror image to the nutrition alarmists, one also sees a disturbing temptation on the part of those who represent themselves as scientific to go too far in the other direction and point to Schoenfeld and Ioannidis’ study as a convenient excuse to summarily dismiss nutritional epidemiological findings linking various foods or types of foods with cancer or other disease.  Meaning, yeah, this study shows that some weak research is being overstated, but that the underlying science that supports the conclusions of the strong research showing things like red meat is bad, vegetables are good, is still not in doubt.",™

t5_2qh03,Pussy_Riot,1358209840,"Don't go to kotaku. It's a shit site. Here's what they said:  ""This is NRA: Practice Range. It's a new iOS game released apparently by the fine folks at the National Rifle Association, who have graciously decided to make it both free and available to kids aged 4+ so that anyone, no matter how old they are, can practice using guns to shoot things. There are three modes in the game, which is designed by MEDL Mobile and listed on iTunes as an ""Official NRA Licensed Product."" We've got: Indoor shooting, outdoor shooting, and skeet shooting. In all of them, you get to pick a weapon and use it to shoot moving targets. You can use handguns and shotguns. You can also buy an AK47 assault rifle for just $0.99, which is a very good deal for an AK47 assault rifle. Other weapons, like an MK11 sniper rifle, also cost $0.99 each.  And then there is the best part. As you play NRA: Practice Range, you'll see NRA Fun Facts™ like ""The NRA sanctions or sponsors over 11,000 shooting competitions and 50 shooting championships each year!"" and ""NRA programs train over 750,000 gun owners each year!"" These NRA Fun Facts™ are also free and available to kids ages four and up.  Today is the one-month anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, which groups like the National Rifle Association have been trying to link to violent video games for precisely one month.  The irony of NRA: Practice Range is likely lost on NRA chief Wayne LaPierre, who spoke out last month against video games, calling gaming ""a corrupt shadow industry that sells and sows violence against its own people."" LaPierre pinned the blame for Sandy Hook and shootings like it on games like Mortal Kombat and Bulletstorm.  This isn't the first game the NRA has made. Back in 2006, the friendly group of gun owners released NRA Gun Club, which was hated by just about everyone. NRA: Practice Range is also, quite frankly, totally awful.  The game will surely raise eyebrows, but it technically isn't the kind of garish shooter that the NRA was going after. It's a gun game, but is it a violent video game? Depends on your definition of violence. And whether this is an NRA blunder is up to debate, according to game designer and scholar Ian Bogost, who recently wrote about the rhetoric around video games for The Atlantic.  ""It's another specimen in the NRA's ongoing effort to present gun ownership and use as a part of a practice of sportsmanship and as participation in an existing community of 'responsible gun owners,'"" he told Kotaku. ""Contrary to immediate reaction among some of the game playing and development community, the NRA's presentation of the game as an educational tool fit for kids will read as consistent with their overall project and message among NRA supporters. It also serves a rhetorical function as a PR-baiting tool. For example, when game devs and critics call the game 'terrible,' as some have done, the NRA can simply respond that our community must only want to partake of the violent uses of firearms, and that's why we are unable to appreciate a firing range simulator.  ""The point is not whether or not you agree or disagree with the NRA's stances or its media efforts, this game included. But rather, that the game is consistent with and carefully positioned within that rhetoric. It's not some sort of PR mistake, for them.""  We've reached out to the NRA for comment and clarification.""  Here's the update: http://imgur.com/Cc0aA",™

You should be able to find some of these at local hardware stores if not you can order these online. [Cable Organizer Wire Loom](http://cableorganizer.com/wire-loom/)  For the wires that are difficult to bundle consider using either apple cider vinegar or ara pet-friendly deterrent spray-on product called [Grannick's Bitter Apple®](http://www.grannicks.com) usually found worldwide at most pet stores. It is a citrusy scent that once a cat tastes will generally avoid those areas which have that particular odour.

[Here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CIbDgZJxHjI/TeDq9NYsmzI/AAAAAAAABdc/glirYbMzpRs/s1600/alchemist_symbols.jpg) is an example of some symbols. (To find more, just do a Google image search.) Beyond just the four elements, note that there are multiple metals listed. In this particular example, they are shown in correspondence with planets/gods, hence the astrological symbols association with them.  For example, Copper is shown with the Venus symbol: ♀ Copper can be a bright orange colour, so maybe orange or orange blossom would be good flavour for that.  I would suggest, however, that you take some time to dig a bit about what each symbol means &amp; come up with the flavour correspondences yourself. Whatever makes sense to *you* really is what will work best for you.  You might also consider looking into Ayurveda or Chinese medicine--it's not Western Alchemy, but they have specific flavour correspondences to elements already, e.g. water is salty [like salt water taffy].",♀

It's not that I don't ""think"" there is a god or gods, I also don't know if there is, as well as I also don't have ""any reason"" to believe there is any.  &gt;So I have to wonder how you can say with any surety what my religion requires?

I wanted to learn &amp; know everything about my faith. That changed over time; it change during my studies. I studied &amp; still study everything about it. The transition was extremely rough, but that's another story.   &gt;I have known God all my conscious life (no exageration).   OK. So what or how did you test for this to identify which spirit, god, or deity is was? Did it identify itself to you? Did you hear it or see it?

You actually lack the evidence to make such an assessment.   &gt;.Next, they aren't my definitions, but my choice of those offered by Merriam Webster Dictionary,  The definition you gave for ""know"" was incorrect. I use a Merriam Webster collegiate dictionary.  &gt;First what does this have to do with my statement?   To better understand the assertion you've made.   &gt;Second, the scripture Job 37:18 says ""strong as a molten looking glass."" As, meaning like. Molten glass is orange and blue (depending on the sand and other rock particals in it), and liquid. Not very strong  No. The fragment of ""as strong as a molten looking glass"" describes a finished product, regardless if you disagree. That verse is discussed widely due to what it implies.   Different Bibles also concur. Feel free to observe the examples I gave or even explore the many, many Bibles as you wish with the link I've provided.

I thought what would work a lot towards such a decision for CLG is that Link lives in the house with them while Jiji wanted to stay alone with his gf. That he agreed to move in for S3 was a surprise to me but it shows that he really cares about the team. Also that he thought about giving Link the position anyway... What a great man ;_;  ♥ Jiji  The majority of the team wasn't really content with how Jiji plays in tournaments. In my opinion the whole ""OMFG JIJI NEVER ROAMS, NEVER WINS MID, GG"" comments were always a little exaggerated. He's a great player for sure. There's certainly some truth in that, though, but we'll see whether Link is really the better choice (not saying he couldn't be, both are great).  I'm looking forward to see how the changes work for CLG and hope Jiji will still have his moments of glory as sub as he's just a great and really funny fellow. On top of that, it's kinda cool to know Jiji will be streaming more. I love his weird guy rainbow sheep loving kind of character :D ",♥

It does not reside on the player`s computer or the game server, and does not examine the players' devices or perpetually look for the latest hacks. FairFight uses GameBlocks' proprietary GameChanger™ (Patent Pending) rule engine and database structures to evaluate players' gameplay actions and Make it a FairFight™ for everyone. Players' actions are tested against multiple statistical markers to identify cheating as it occurs. GameBlocks believes that ""cheaters"" are customers too, and that banning players is detrimental to your game. FairFight's graduated penalty system (warning/restriction/suspension) has been shown to effectively suppress and deter ""cheaters"" by imposing prompt and appropriate penalties automatically, while simultaneously notifying them.      **Forum post from player:  [HERE](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?90628-Here-is-some-info-on-WarZ-New-Anti-Cheat-FairFight-in-simple-words&amp;p=1417764)**      **Forum post from Kewk about it [HERE](http://forums.playwarz.com/showthread.php?92055-Regarding-FairFight-and-reporting-players&amp;highlight=FairFight)**      C/P:    Regarding FairFight and reporting players Hey guys,   There seems to be some confusion about the process involved in banning players that have been reported using FairFight. Let me make this process a bit more clear.   When a player is reported for hacking that report is put into a database. Once in the database a human must then read the report and review the case. If any suspicious activity has been recorded the player will be monitored more closely until we can prove with certainty, by a human, that the player has been hacking/cheating and then a human will ban that player.   A player can be reported a million times but this will not automatically ban the player.   We encourage all of you to submit reports of hackers, so that we are able to take action. However, please do not abuse the system. You only need to report a player one time and spamming the same player could lead to action being taken against the spammer.   For those unsure about what FairFight is:  In game if you type ""FairFight PlayerName Reason for report"" it will report that player for the reason you have specified.   ",™

You can't really do that, so you have to rely mostly on your voice; tonality and banter will be very important for you, so I suggest reading up on it.  You will have to decide what is most effective, as I am unsure: 20% Tonality, 80% Content or what?  For Tonality:  Make sure to have a strong voice that people can hear. Above *everything*, that's your rule number one. To be sure, that is rule number one for most people, regardless of their condition.  I don't know of any resources for improving speech other than mimicking men who speak well. You may want to make recordings of monologues by typical heart-throbs and good speakers—Johnny Depp, Brad Bitt, or whomever you choose. You can tell I don't know many good speakers. lol I like Tom Hardy's Bane simply because of the force of his personality. If you chose to focus a bit on this, asking around for some books might be good.  For Content:  Practice talking with girls a lot. Ask around if anyone knows any good books that discuss banter. Juggler (Wayne Elise) is a Pickup guy who is an incredible conversationalist. Maybe read books on storytelling? I'm not sure.  But conversation is only part of it. Connecting with a girl is very important, but you have to move her sexually somehow. Sex appeal is a very mental thing, so find parts of you that can be your sex appeal.  I can picture a man who connects extremely well with (intelligent) women, and that person is so charismatic and brave in all parts of his life that he has amazing sex appeal.

If I use my water quenched bullets (significantly harder) that I normally use in .357 loads in my .38 loads, it leaves significant leading.   The brands of bullets you're using might just be the correct hardness for the case pressure you're loading to. Bullets that are too hard that don't have enough pressure behind them do not deform the back of the bullet enough to make a proper seal with the barrel. This causes gas to shoot past the bullet, deforming the sides and leaving lead in the barrel. Bullets that are too soft with too much pressure behind them get deformed too much in the rear and leave lead in the barrel.  ""too soft of a bullet (e.g. BHN &lt; 8) can be stripped if pushed too fast, while a bullet that's too hard (e.g. BHN 22) can fail to obturate, and lead the trailing edge of the lands.

The US government didn't undertake these actions, Ms. Lofgren. They were undertaken by Democrats. Specific Democrats.  Here are the *specific Democrats* who indicted Aaron Swartz to death:  [Carmen Ortiz was appointed by Barack Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Ortiz), leader of the Democrat Party, to which you belong.  She is, as you know, the first Democrat Wise Latina™ to ever head the US Attorney's office in Democrat Party-controlled Massachusetts.  Aaron almost single-handedly killed The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) ... advanced in the Senate by Democrat Harry Reid, who took $4 million in donations from the Motion Picture Association of America (run by Democrat Chris Dodd) to advance SOPA legislation in the Senate.  The bill was co-sponsored by Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, head of the Democrat National Committee and a good friend of you, Zoe Lofgren.  They wanted Aaron dead for fucking up their plans. *And now he's dead.*  Carmen Ortiz is a public official, who works for the taxpayers of the United States of America.  [Her office telephone number is public information](http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/contact.html). It is: **(617) 748-3100**  Give her a call and let her know how you feel. *Punch back ... twice as hard.*  Better yet, her office is located at 1 Courthouse Way, Suite 9200, Boston, MA.

Additionally, most waterslides are part of larger setups that include 3-4 waterslides of similar length. So in essence, a lifeguard watching a waterslide must patrol up to 800 metres of slide. That’s more than most police officers have to deal with.  Now imagine that everyone says to themselves, “Fuck the lifeguards. We’re rational and intelligent people, and we know how to stay safe. We can go down fucking waterslides by ourselves.” They grab him by the genitals and toss him off the platform, snapping his spine in two and cracking his skull like a poorly made bowling pin.  (Just for context, let’s say this is all happening at Waterworld™ in Racine, Wisconsin. My cousin Lenny worked there one summer and said that it made him lose his faith in humanity. Then again Lenny’s kind of a head case so I don’t know if he should talk. One time he got super drunk and thought it would be funny to see how fast his car could go in reverse. He drove straight into an elm tree which fell on top of his neighbor’s—who happens to be Kobe Bryant—house. Kobe was mostly cool about it, but his wife got really pissed and Lenny had to shell out $500 to get some immigrant to come fix it—his words, not mine.)  Now that the people control the waterslide, they delegate two task forces: 1-Alpha, in charge of general maintenance and 2-Alpha, who take care of more technical issues. But this is a classic example of the Prisoner’s Dilemma: 1-Alpha will always insist that something is technical and outside their realm of knowledge, while 2-Alpha says that everything is simple and beneath them. To solve this problem, they form a third task force, 2-Beta, which is headed by Christopher Walken, who is visiting Waterworld with his two children.  As you might expect, Walken shakes things up. He hires an assassin to take out the leaders of 1- and 2-Alpha, and then instates his own stooges as their leaders. The people, concerned about the death of their liberties, hold a council meeting to try to find a peaceful solution. But it’s broken up by armed guards, and a lot of people are trampled to death or shot.  I wish I could explain it better but I’m not a professor, and quite honestly I don’t think I’ll ever be one because I think they’re gross. One of my high school friends is a professor now and all he ever does is pick his butthole and write absurdist literature. Someday I will go visit him but I need to save up money.

t5_2s7tt,uselessstolencomment,1358306737,"Think of it like a waterslide:  Waterslides are 100-200 metres long and twist and turn a lot. Additionally, most waterslides are part of larger setups that include 3-4 waterslides of similar length. So in essence, a lifeguard watching a waterslide must patrol up to 800 metres of slide. That’s more than most police officers have to deal with.  Now imagine that everyone says to themselves, “Fuck the lifeguards. We’re rational and intelligent people, and we know how to stay safe. We can go down fucking waterslides by ourselves.” They grab him by the genitals and toss him off the platform, snapping his spine in two and cracking his skull like a poorly made bowling pin.  (Just for context, let’s say this is all happening at Waterworld™ in Racine, Wisconsin. My cousin Lenny worked there one summer and said that it made him lose his faith in humanity. Then again Lenny’s kind of a head case so I don’t know if he should talk. One time he got super drunk and thought it would be funny to see how fast his car could go in reverse. He drove straight into an elm tree which fell on top of his neighbor’s—who happens to be Kobe Bryant—house. Kobe was mostly cool about it, but his wife got really pissed and Lenny had to shell out $500 to get some immigrant to come fix it—his words, not mine.)  Now that the people control the waterslide, they delegate two task forces: 1-Alpha, in charge of general maintenance and 2-Alpha, who take care of more technical issues. But this is a classic example of the Prisoner’s Dilemma: 1-Alpha will always insist that something is technical and outside their realm of knowledge, while 2-Alpha says that everything is simple and beneath them. To solve this problem, they form a third task force, 2-Beta, which is headed by Christopher Walken, who is visiting Waterworld with his two children.  As you might expect, Walken shakes things up. He hires an assassin to take out the leaders of 1- and 2-Alpha, and then instates his own stooges as their leaders. The people, concerned about the death of their liberties, hold a council meeting to try to find a peaceful solution. But it’s broken up by armed guards, and a lot of people are trampled to death or shot.  I wish I could explain it better but I’m not a professor, and quite honestly I don’t think I’ll ever be one because I think they’re gross. One of my high school friends is a professor now and all he ever does is pick his butthole and write absurdist literature. Someday I will go visit him but I need to save up money. I lost most of my savings in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and need to earn it back ASAP. Where would you suggest that I find work? I tried Dunkin’ Donuts but I don’t want to support them because they recognize gay rights.  Hope this helps. ",™

t5_2qnwb,deffie,1358311216,"1. Before diagnosis, I drank .. *a lot*. After starting Adderall, I found my “want” for boozing seriously diminish. Looking back, I honestly believe that drinking pre-medication was how I coped with feeling like I wasn’t “normal”. I still drink booze and coffee like a champion and have not had any bad experiences. I did shy away from caffeine for the first few months because I was still adjusting. Just watch out while taking your meds hungover:   dehydration, Adderall and detoxing from a long night isn’t fun. Always, always listen to your body.   2. Treatment has been like putting on a pair of glasses on for the first time. You go however many years getting by, knowing something “might” be different than the norm, but dealing with it. You go to your eye doctor and he/she puts your new lenses on your face and BAM- you can see. You never knew how much you were actually missing out on until you saw the world “normally”.  It has changed my life for the better in every aspect.    3. Initially, once a month with my university physician. Once we figured out the appropriate dose, just every three months for rx refills.   4. My live-in boyfriend didn’t believe in ADHD. I started my meds and quit after two weeks (I later learned that your body needs time to adjust to its new medication, you HAVE to give it time). We were at an airport and I was jittery, knocking my drink over and being a complete spaz. He snapped “DID YOU TAKE YOUR ADDERALL!?” “NO!” “WHY?!” “… I DON’T KNOW. I thought you were judging me.” “Please. Start taking it.” This really opened the line of conversation between us (and legitimized the disorder in his mind)—he’s been very supportive ever since.  I didn’t tell really anyone about my diagnosis, I was just concentrating on myself. I did loose a noticeable amount of weight and a lot of people were concerned so that sucked.   5. My anxiety since starting college (the first time) was through the roof—I visited the ER a few times because I was convinced I was having strokes/couldn’t feel my face/felt like body parts weren’t a “part” of me – I later learned these were me suffering anxiety attacks. It didn’t help that my doctor at the time didn’t recognize this and thought I had Multiple Sclerosis. That’s when shit hit the fan, college became too much and I dropped out for two years. I started again and immediately started feeling terrible. I originally went to my current physician for anxiety and depression. After speaking with him for two hours, he brought up that I might have ADHD. I was stunned. After that, all of the dots started connecting and it became quite apparent I actually had it. I haven’t had an anxiety attack in three years. **Treatment of my ADHD literally gave me my life back.**  Note: I apologize for my extremely poor grammar.

t5_2qh2p,SockofBadKarma,1358313112,"Okay. I've now seen multiple comments here that are simply inaccurate.  1. The serpent first had legs, and for its treachery it lost those legs and was forced to eat the dust of the Earth. More than enough of an argument to say ""Hey, it can't speak any more because God removed that ability when he forced snakes to eat dirt!"" An argument based on flawed premises? Obviously, but easily ""explainable"" without referencing biological evolution.  2. Satan *WAS NOT* the serpent. This crap is thrown around far more often than it should be. The Satan of the Tanakh is simply a prosecuting attorney in God's court; he's supposed to provide counterarguments (for some odd reason). He is not evil, nor is he God's nemesis. The Satan of the New Testament was upgraded to some Mecha-Monster-Super-Evil-Dude®, partially to fulfill vague prophecies, partially to capitalize on the new trend of monotheism (which, judging by the works of many modern historians, was NOT what ancient Judaism was; the Jews were a sectarian cult centered around just one god of their pantheon - YHWH), and partially because God needed a good evil dude to thwart. This is essentially also what happened to ""Hell"" and ""Heaven""; they were all Flanderized to the point of unrecognizability in order to fit in line with the Christ cult's teachings. And to get back to the original point, the serpent was just that: some sassy serpent with a smart mouth who wanted to mess with Eve. It wasn't *either* form of Satan, nor is there any indication anywhere in Genesis that this should be a valid retcon. Satan as the serpent is basically early Christian fan editing, spurred by political interests (i.e. usurping the Jewish tradition with rewrites) and a distorted view brought about by the mad ramblings in Revelation.  3. Just to reiterate, people who argue that evolution isn't real are likely to be biblical literalists. So God's curse on the serpent, to them, is a perfectly (internally) logical explanation for why snakes can no longer speak, and it in no way infringes upon their delusion that evolution is a massive secular conspiracy. In fact, God's magical declarations changing the very physiology of Adam, Eve, the serpent, and even Earth itself (depending on how one wants to interpret the stuff about Adam's descendents toiling to grow food in unyielding soil) are the exact definition of divine intervention/special creationism. Again, the core premises are flawed, but if those premises were accepted (which is the case for these people), then this philosoraptor meme is entirely irrelevant to their ontology. ___________________________ tl;dr Stop flagrantly misrepresenting Bible stories if you're going to argue against them. It's completely fine to not read the book if you're also going to not talk about the book, but if you *are* going to talk about the book, get the basic facts straight. I'd look pretty silly if I went to a book discussion on *Twilight* and started saying that Edward is actually a Merman in disguise and Bella has laser vision. And you (by you, I don't just mean the OP) look pretty silly saying that the serpent's loss of speech is a biblical argument against creationism and that Satan is the serpent. ___________________________ Better tl;dr They don't talk because of Godmagic, just like everything else in Genesis. You've demonstrated nothing of value with your little quip.",®

t5_2r275,Redadja,1358341411,"Just go outside and talk to people. Seriously. Honestly.  I'm in a similar situation to you. I quit my job (retail) that I hated to go back to my studies (I.T). After the vacation feeling wore off I started getting *desperately* lonely, my job sucked but I was around hundreds of other people, eight hours a day for nearly eight years. Being alone with my textbooks was a big change.  At first I thought **""If only I could finish my studies, I could get a job so I can see other people again and be happy""**. That was probably the most serious and expensive mistake I have made in my entire life.  I had this rigid plan of action and thought I had to stick to a time-table of making new friends. I got more depressed the longer I was alone. I couldn't concentrate on my work and started taking longer and longer breaks to make myself feel better. Very soon I was not doing even one minute of studying per day. This lasted for six months and cost me around £5000 in household bills and probably £7500 of, after tax, potential I.T. earnings (around $20,000 total).  Over Christmas I saw my family again and had a great time. I had been avoiding them for months because my ambitious career plans had gone to shit and I felt like a loser. Thank goodness for that whole ""unconditional-love"" thing, eh? Instantly, I felt a thousand times better, able to concentrate again and have done more work in the last three weeks than I had since quitting my job in June.  **My advice to you**  * Become best friends with your Aunt. Seriously. I got talking with my Nan recently and she has had the most amazing life. Family is really the most powerful resource anyone can have. You lose touch with friends but family, the ones who were there when you were born and who share up to 50% identical DNA tend to stick around. As a bonus, interacting with someone positively everyday will improve your mood, concentration and social skills. Soon you will be able to do things you never even dreamed of. I went into a cage full of cheetahs with my older sister's support (but that's a whole other story).  * Go outside immediately to a place where people are and start up idle conversations. Seriously, finish this paragraph and go, do not wait until later today/tomorrow for the *'Right Time'*. It doesn't exist. You will put it off one day at a time for the rest of your life. There is a myth in our society that only weirdos would interact with strangers. It is this myth that causes *everyone to avoid even making eye contact with other people while on public transport.* Now that is weird. We're all humans but modern society expects us to be robots, never showing emotion or interacting with others. Once you start interacting with people they forget these artificial unwritten rules and return to their humanity. Try interacting with other people for just ONE DAY and I guarantee it will alter your perceptions as it did mine. Go to the supermarket cereal aisle and ask a customer there ""which one do you think tastes the best?"" honestly listen to their opinion (everyone wants to tell their story, it is the reason I'm typing all this).  * Read [""How to Win Friends and Influence People""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie. [Free PDF](http://erudition.mohit.tripod.com/_Influence_People.pdf). [Amazon](http://goo.gl/H4W47). Don't be put off by the title, it changed my life. **TL;DR** - How do you get people to like you? Be a good person. How do you get people to listen to you? Listen to them.  * Be Happy. *Positive Mental Outlook™* and all that, but it does work. Unless you are currently on fire or being eaten by a Tiger it is really not that bad. Focus on all the good things in your life and use them as tools to help you get what you want. Think of bad things as 'room for improvement'. Being gloomy saps your energy (I know this better than most) and takes away your strength to change things. Anything can be changed if you work hard enough at it.",™

t5_2r0cn,Elliptical_Tangent,1358347230,"She violated your trust in a spectacularly outrageous fashion.  Personally, I don't know how you ever find it in yourself to trust her again, seeing as how she was with you for 7 years, and then 2 months after the wedding - still in the honeymoon phase - decides to cheat on you.  You thought you knew her, you thought it was a good relationship, you married her, and she immediately turns around and violates her vows.  Very hard to justify, and harder to forget.  You're doing the right thing to save the marriage.  In counseling, be sure to bring up that things are better but you can't stop thinking about it.  Make a point of talking about how you can't stop thinking about it every session until it's no longer true.  The counselor will have advice for building the trust up again, if it can be built.  **Ignore the rest, it's just my personal opinion, and I'm not proud of it**  My personal advice is to leave.  You've married someone who doesn't want to be married to you is the only possible way I can read your situation.  The two of you have a lot of history, but if she really thought you were the one for her, there's Zero Percent™ possibility of this happening.  She married you despite misgivings she's had for a long time (in all likelihood), then gave into temptation immediately afterwards.  This is not a relationship that's going to go the distance, and if she could cheat on you 2 months after you got married, she can cheat on you anytime.  She promises she'll never do it again?  Like the vow to love you until death do us part that resulted in infidelity 2 months later?  How do you ever forget that?  Out there, right now, is the right woman for you.  She's looking for a guy just like you, so has no interest in being with anyone else.  She's trying to find you, but you're spending this time trying to find a way to sail a boat with a rhino-sized hole in it off the rocks of infidelity.  Why not take this time to find the right woman rather than trying to find a way to accept the actions of the wrong one?  And if you say, well my wife needs someone, then set her free to find him, because he's out there right now too.  I wish you only the best of luck.  My heart genuinely goes out to you.",™

t5_2t5sa,TheFunDontStop,1358349833,"I don't understand why you're being so black and white about this. ""We don't know everything about the mind/brain relationship"" is a far cry from ""we know **absolutely nothing** about the mind/brain relationship and cannot ever make any heuristic guesses or assumptions about it"". The idea that ""the mind is the brain, therefore children are more intelligent then adults because brain development lowers intelligence"" is any kind of valid is frankly absurd, and smacks of stereotypical redditor ""so Rational^(®)""-ness. At this point in our scientific knowledge, I doubt there's anything about the function of the brain that we can say with 100% certainty, but that doesn't mean we know nothing.  Here's my argument, more expanded. A fetus clearly doesn't have the same mental capacity as an adult, right? And neither does a newborn? Would you say a two-year-old has the same ability for analytical thought as a thirty-five-year-old? What about when they're four? It probably can't be generalized between, say, someone who's 18 and someone who's 20, or someone who's 6 and someone who's 8, but it's impossible to deny that there's a general development on a large scale from conception to adulthood. Then, since the mind is obviously linked to the brain in a significant way (even though we don't know all the details of that relationship), I don't see why you would be so adamant to deny the idea that ""intelligence"" or ""mental capacity"" or whatever we want to call it develops gradually along with the physical brain through childhood and adolescence.

t5_2qxih,ADG12311990,1358364089,"For those of you at Work:  Welcome back to our newest blog of our Companions 101 series. If you missed our previous blogs, I am Courtney Woods, Community Production Specialist, and I will be your guide as we learn more about the Companions of The Old Republic™! This series is meant to supplement our Companions Holonet Page and provide insights, background information, and tips for the featured Companion. We will be rotating between Imperial and Republic Companions. Since we featured Vette last week, we will be switching back over to the Republic to focus on the Trooper’s first companion, Aric Jorgan, as requested by your comments in our previous Companions 101 threads. You can post your suggestions for Companions to be featured in our next blog in this official forum thread.  Havoc Squad, move out!  Please Note: This blog contains spoilers for the Republic Trooper class story.  **Meeting Aric Jorgan**  Efficient, loyal, and a perfectionist, Aric Jorgan is the ideal Republic soldier – and he knows it. Raised to be an officer, Aric is confident in his skills and doesn’t waste his time with niceties or politics. His credentials include four years in the academy and seven years in the field. Most notably, Jorgan was a part of the illustrious Dead Eyes, the finest sniper squad in the Republic. Eventually he was offered a promotion and a post on Ord Mantell. Aric views his assignment on Ord Mantell as just another stepping stone in his career. He wants to fight Imperials, not Separatists. When the Trooper meets Jorgan, he is fast on his way to becoming Captain. Jorgan is coordinating the efforts of Havoc Squad and the Republic’s Ord Mantell Infantry Command to search for a highly dangerous bomb.  *“I'll make this completely clear, rookie - when you're in the field, what I say goes. Period.”*  Jorgan sees the Trooper as a rookie – one with raw talent, but still inexperienced in the field. He doesn’t want any success they have to go to their head and make them overconfident. His highest priority is the success of the mission and the safety of his fellow soldiers. He isn’t going to let some “hot shot rookie” endanger this. Jorgan joins Havoc Squad under less than ideal circumstances. I asked Charles Boyd, the writer behind the Trooper storyline, to clarify Jorgan’s motivations for staying with the Trooper:  *“Jorgan’s initial motivation in Havoc Squad is revenge.Working with the Trooper is his best shot at taking down the traitors who betrayed the Republic and (seemingly) ruined his career. But with time, Jorgan realizes that he prefers doing things the Havoc Squad way. Taking the fight to the Empire personally, rather than dealing with the politics of advancement and the detachment of directing missions from a stuffy command center.”*  **Understanding Aric Jorgan**  While Jorgan’s demanding personality makes him dependable on the battlefield, his sternness can become a pain to deal with away from the frontlines. He is a difficult man to get to know and since his demotion on Ord Mantell, Aric has become increasingly disgruntled. This Cathar values actions more than words, so if you want to break down his barriers and gain his respect you will need to prove with your actions that you are worthy of being the commander of Havoc Squad. This means getting the job done without reckless risks, not getting caught up in bureaucratic politics, and having the utmost loyalty to the Republic. Aric is extremely loyal to the Republic. While it is known that the Empire and the Mandalorians have wronged the Cathar in the past, I asked Charles if something happened to Aric personally to cause such devotion to the Republic:  *“Jorgan never suffered personally at the hands of the Sith before enlisting, but his homeworld of Rendili hosted many millions of refugees who had. Seeing the kind of suffering his own ancestors had endured in generations past, Jorgan felt he had a duty to fight back against anyone who would inflict such pain on innocent civilians.”*  This intense feeling of duty Jorgan feels leaves no room for failure and he expects the same from those around him. He also has no time for excuses and needless sacrifice. You won’t be able to gain his admiration easily, but if you can infiltrate his barriers, you will find that Aric Jorgan is someone you definitely want on your side.  **Breaking Protocol…**  *“But for all the rules and regulations telling me otherwise, you’re the one thing I’ll never give up.”*  Having a romantic relationship with your superior officer isn’t exactly something a Republic soldier would want on their record. Luckily for those who wish to romance Aric Jorgan, he isn’t a man to stick by the book. As long as you make it clear he isn’t crossing any lines and that you also have feelings for him, it is possible to have a relationship with Aric. However, he does fluster easily in romantic situations. I asked Charles if he had any advice for the Troopers out there trying to claim this Cathar’s heart:  *“Jorgan looks for a partner he can respect: someone who’s strong, decisive, and practical, like himself. That said, relationships really aren’t Jorgan’s strong suit; there probably isn’t anyone who would describe him as a “people person” in general. He has a particularly hard time when it comes to sharing the kinds of close personal feelings that develop in a romance. But anyone patient enough to work their way past his initially abrasive exterior will find a man who’s fiercely loyal, dedicated, and surprisingly affectionate.”*  There’s sure to be some bumps and awkwardness along the way, but if you stay by Jorgan’s side you will have a loyal mate for life. A good way to move things along quickly is to remember that Jorgan’s likes and interests, so be sure to give him weapons and military gear from time to time.  **Life on the BT-7 Thunderclap**  Aric and the Trooper may have been the first members on the newly formed Havoc Squad, but the crew is growing quickly. As we have mentioned before, Jorgan is a remarkable soldier, but his gruff personality can brush people the wrong way off the field. So what does Jorgan think of the rest of the crew? Charles gives some details on Jorgan’s opinion on the other members of Havoc Squad:  *“Jorgan sees the rest of Havoc Squad more as colleagues than close friends.They’re together to do a job, not to become buddies. That’s not to say he doesn’t have opinions on the others, of course—far from it. He just tends to assess them based on work effectiveness more than their personalities:*  *• Elara Dorne’s strict adherence to rules and regulations definitely goes against Jorgan’s more pragmatic approach to his work, but he can’t help but respect her discipline and effectiveness in her role as team medic. They clash constantly, but Jorgan knows he can rely on Elara when things are at their worst, even if he’d probably never admit it out loud.*  *• If Jorgan has a favorite member of the team aside from the Trooper, it’s probably M1-4X. The Droid follows orders reliably and never complains or makes excuses when things don’t go as planned. Jorgan isn’t blind to the fact that 4X is willing (and even excited) to be completely ruthless when it comes to fighting the Empire, but he figures the Droid can be kept in line well enough to be trustworthy.*  *• Tanno Vik is easily Jorgan’s greatest irritation from day-to-day. Jorgan sees Vik as an undisciplined, unreliable wild card. If he had the choice, he’d probably kick Vik out of Havoc Squad, out of the military, and out of Republic space in general. Since he can’t do that, he settles for keeping Vik as busy as possible, hoping he won’t have time to cause any serious trouble.*  *• Jorgan really doesn’t know what to make of Yuun. The Gand is inarguably effective at his job and clearly a loyal and dutiful soldier, but his methods are so bizarre that Jorgan still has a hard time truly accepting that Yuun can be relied upon.”*  I didn't include the photos of Aric’s customizations because those are easy to find online.

t5_2s8bl,palehorse864,1358401262,"Actually, U.S. Copyright doesn't quite work that way.  The copyright holder maintains the copyright even if someone does parody or make its terms well known.  You're probably thinking about Trademark wall, which is a bit different, and far sillier in some instances.  Trademarks can be genericized through common use. Kleenex had to defend themselves as Kleenex became common parlance for all facial tissues.  The same thing happened with Xerox at some point I believe.  Adobe Photoshop had one of the more amusing ones recently where they insisted every journalist write their trademark correctly.  Correct: The image was enhanced with Adobe® Photoshop® Elements software.  Incorrect: The image was photoshopped.  Incorrect: The image was Photoshopped.  Incorrect: The image was Adobe® Photoshopped.   [I pulled the above from their website](http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html)  The issue they had is that everyone had begun using ""photoshop"" as a slang verb for any modification of an image, and that threatened it becoming generic.  This doesn't always lead to cease and desist orders or suits or pulldowns. It is often handled by an ad and education campaign which shows the government that this company is working to keep their trademark specific.  It looks silly to the public, as it probably is, when they insist everyone use a certain terminology, but it's the least obstructive way to handle it I believe.   All this doesn't really count in the case of Friendship is Witchcraft, unless of course you're from the Dole corporation and wish to keep Apples from becoming generic.

The number you would have to sell to be charged with manufacturing without a license is unclear, because the ATF has never specified (to my knowledge). But if they are meant for you, you should be okay, and if you sell one a year from now because you decide you're tired of it you should also be okay as long as you follow the appropriate laws (stamping a serial number, etc).  The reasons I mention sheet metal AK flats and ""80%"" AR lower receivers is because they're fairly inexpensive, there's a large body of information about making them, and with the right tools they aren't extraordinarily difficult to complete (remember though, nobody can make it for you). Of course, the usual rules apply. Restricted persons are still not allowed to have them; the weapon must be configured in a way that complies with your local laws; be careful what parts kit you get, because some might contain full auto parts that could get you in serious trouble.  Reason I know what I know is I'm in California, and while I haven't done any builds this way myself, it's a popular thing to do here because of our laws.

t5_2qh2p,Shadw21,1358427420,"If you're thinking of the LaVey Satanists, or any group that have based themselves off of them, you'd be wrong. Want to understand them do the same things you do with christians, read their bible. I can assure you that the Satanic bible is quite entertaining. Their ""Black Mass"" is mainly theatrical and meant to be thought provoking/shock factor to those not in the know/christians. Their rituals are done mainly to be symbolic or as a way to connect to some part of their psyche, i.e. facing their demons/inner self. The closest they believe in God or Satan is perhaps some force of nature, but more likely a product of one's mind/beliefs, especially if brought up christian, that once realized for what it is, can be used to better themselves as it is as they've discovered/realized, a part of them.   This is like a mental exercise, you summon some demon/spirit that you've made up as some part of yourself and tell it/yourself what you want it/you to do, usually something you'd do anyway, it's just a way of boosting your confidence, or if you want, you tell it to go mess up that one asshole's life. Sure you know nothing is likely to come of it, but it makes you feel better anyways, and even more if some bad does happen to the asshole.  Then there's the hollywood satanists as I call them, who actually go out and kill animals for their 'rituals', which are usually something they've seen in a hollywood film and are usually christian teens trying to rebel/be 'evil' and actually want to 'connect' with demons because they believe them to be real.  And if you want to sum up the LaVey Satanist, just remember their 9th Satanic Statement: ""Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!""  Hmm, eh fuck it, here's the Church of Satan's main rules/commandments/testaments/etc: http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Theory.html   The Nine Satanic Statements from The Satanic Bible, ©1969 by Anton Szandor LaVey  1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!  2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!  3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!  4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!  5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!  6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!  7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!  8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!  9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!  The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1967  1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  3. When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  9. Do not harm little children.  10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.   The Nine Satanic Sins by Anton Szandor LaVey ©1987  1. Stupidity—The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It’s too bad that stupidity isn’t painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid.  2. Pretentiousness—Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn’t applying the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone’s made to feel like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not.  3. Solipsism—Can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, responses and sensibilities onto someone who is probably far less attuned than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy and respect that you naturally give them. They won’t. Instead, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of “Do unto others as they do unto you.” It’s work for most of us and requires constant vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a Machiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point.  4. Self-deceit—It’s in the “Nine Satanic Statements” but deserves to be repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it’s fun, and with awareness. But then, it’s not self-deceit!  5. Herd Conformity—That’s obvious from a Satanic stance. It’s all right to conform to a person’s wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of the many.  6. Lack of Perspective—Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now, every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swayed by herd constraints—know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world.  7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies—Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwashing people into accepting something new and different, when in reality it’s something that was once widely accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the creator and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society.  8. Counterproductive Pride—That first word is important. Pride is great up to the point you begin to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The rule of Satanism is: if it works for you, great. When it stops working for you, when you’ve painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say, I’m sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow, then do it.  9. Lack of Aesthetics—This is the physical application of the Balance Factor. Aesthetics is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is obvious that no one can collect any money off classical standards of beauty and form most of the time so they are discouraged in a consumer society, but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essential Satanic tool and must be applied for greatest magical effectiveness. It’s not what’s supposed to be pleasing—it’s what is. Aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of one’s own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied.   tl;dr:LaVey Satanists aren't crazy, understand basic human nature, decide to capitalize on it when they wish to, and are essentially agnostics/athiests who like to have fun at the expense of christian's fears of 'evil', which is simply 'live' backwards.",©

t5_2qh1i,z0mbiegrl,1358441412,"**Repost**   When I was 15 years old, I started attending a rather prestigious christian school. Yeah, yeah, uniforms and the whole bit. I'd grown up very sheltered, thus I wasn't really used to any kind of male attention, which I got, having developed early, in great quantities. Usually, I was either embarrased, or convinced that the guy(s) were playing some kind of joke on me. I didn't believe that I was really at all attractive. Then one day I found a note in my locker. It was a plain white index card, folded over and sealed with a little foil heart sticker. Inside, it simply said ""I think you're beautiful."" in careful print. That one got to me. It was very, very different from what I was used to... Basically leering, dirty comments, or propositions. That was sweet, innocent, and touching. I wondered who sent it, but didn't really have any way of finding out. So I stuck it in one of my notebooks and began to daydream about who might be my secret admirer. Was it the cute boy who gave me a pencil in my homeroom? Maybe my lab partner, who I found utterly adorable, even though he was a few years older than I was.   I was a ditzy, moony eyed teenage girl, dreaming of puppy love and maybe my first kiss. I took the note out whenever I was sad or upset and it always made me smile, but weeks had passed and I had no idea at all who had left it, nor had I gotten another one. I began to worry that maybe it wasn't really meant for me at all. Maybe someone had just put it in the wrong locker by mistake.   I was feeling down on myself and a little silly when I opened my locker one morning and - behold! - another note. Same little white index card, folded over and sealed with the same little foil heart. Trembling with excitement and anticipation, I carefully peeled one lobe of the heart up and read the following words: ""You are so lovely."" Like any dopey kid, I held the note to my chest, sighing, with a dumb grin on my face. 2 notes? It was no accident! Someone really liked ME. WOW! I made a dumb little scrap book thing and tucked the notes inside. I also began trying again in earnest to discern the identity of my secret admirer, but with only two unsigned notes as clues, I didn't get very far. I knew that whomever left the notes had to go to my school, that was obvious... But I didn't know much else. Maybe my admirer wasn't a guy at all. Damn. I didn't like mysteries I couldn't solve.   During this time, I had been building a friendship with a classmate, we'll call him Mark. Mark was a sophmore (I was a senior) but we had AP Latin together. We shared a free period as well, and sometimes hung out in the library, as we were both avid readers. Mark wasn't exactly my type, if a 15 year old can be said to have one, but he was sweet and we had many common interests. As we spent more time together, I started thinking that the notes were from him. Then one day, he confessed to ""liking"" me, and I had my answer! Or so I thought.  Mark told me how he felt over stale fundraising donuts eaten on the back wall behind the gym. I laughed, getting powdered sugar all over my stupid vest. ""Why the big charade?"" I asked, ""Why didn't you just tell me to begin with instead of leaving me those mysterious notes?"" Mark's face fell. ""What notes? I didn't send you any notes, Z0mbiegrl."" The mystery continues... but now I had a coconspirator. (Forgive my naivette. I was 15 and didn't realize how cruel it was to use someone who had just confessed to liking me, but that I wasn't really all that keen on to help me figure out who my secret admirer was, all the while hoping it was someone I really DID like...)   Another week, another note. ""I think about you always."". Awwww. Mark was starting to exhibit some signs of jealousy, which I brushed off. After all, we didn't know who the mystery notesender was. It could be snort Riley! (The token loaner/weird kid). Time went on, and I started losing focus in class. My grades didn't slip or anything, I made up for it, but as a normally attentive student, there was a clear shift in my attention. I went from listening intently to a talk on greek mythology to being called on and gasp! not knowing the anwser because I was too busy staring off into the distance and imagining my secret admirer as some sort of Tuxedo Mask-like figure, who would someday reveal himself and give me a rose and a dashing smile.   The next note said ""You smell like love itself."" Huh. I didn't know how to take that. I smelled like a combination of L'Oreal Kids Cherry shampoo and Cotton Candy Body Fantasies™. But, if that was what love smelled like, ok! The next note said ""I want to touch you."" Ok. That's a little creepy, but maybe in a kind of sweet way, right? Mark was freaked out and said I should go to the authorities, or at least the Head Mistress. I was dead set against that. I might scare my admirer away, if not get him/her in trouble. I didn't want to do that. So I tucked the note away with the others and waited for the next one.   I spent the night at a friend's house at some point. Typical teenage stuff. We watched stupid movies, gossiped about everything, ate junk food, and played with makeup. It was a great time, though by then I had begun to realize that I fit in better with the boys (Especially the video game/tabletop playing kind) than I ever would with the girls. When I left the following morning, something caught my eye - and stopped my heart. On my friend's mailbox, shimmering innocently in the 10:00 AM light, was a foil heart. Ok, now I was officially freaked out. I ran back inside and told my friend and her mother. Both of them seemed to think I was on something or overreacting. It was, after all, February. Heart stickers were everywhere. That one might've even been there for a while and I just hadn't noticed it. I dropped it, but inside I was still afraid.   Monday morning... another note. ""I want to taste you."" OK, this wasn't cool anymore. Not at all. But I didn't know what to do. I talked about it to Mark, who convinced me to approach the school's very own Safety Officer... Who proceeded to laugh at me. ""Kid, if I went after every hormone addled guy with a crush who didn't have the balls to admit it, I'd be here forever!"" Yeah. Ok.   I stole one of my father's pocket knives and began carrying it around with me ""for protection"". (Yeah, like a dull 2"" blade is going to stop ANYONE.) I stopped going to my usual after school activities and hurred for my bus as soon as the bell rang. I always took the seat closest to the door in class, so I could see if anyone looked in, or looked suspicious as they passed by. And I found more heart stickers. It felt like they were everywhere I looked. I started having panic attacks when I saw them. On the window of my mother's car. On the table I sat at at lunch. On the door of the girls' room after I left (When it hadn't been there before).   Mark wanted me to go to the ""real cops"", but I couldn't make myself do it, not after the way Safety Guy had treated me. I didn't want to be laughed at again. It's a major issue for me, not to be taken seriously. So I did nothing. I suffered in silence. Until one day I came home and got the mail. Just like always... only this time, mixed in with the catalogs and bills was a plain white envelope sealed with one of those goddamned evil foil hearts. Inside it were pictures. Horrible pictures. Pictures of a grown man in various states of undress, doing things to himself. And a note. ""I bet your blood tastes like chocolate.""   I started screaming, which got my mother's attention. She called the police, who came out to the house and took a report. Luckily, I recognized the man in the photos, and they were more than enough evidence to arrest the slimeball. He was the school janitor.  Edit: **Yes, I was a senior at 15. I skipped a few grades.** ",™

What’s the difference? A passive adapter is the most basic type of adapter that can purchased. A passive DisplayPort adapter merely allows the GPU to communicate with a “language” that can be understood by the attached monitor, which has a differing connector.  As an example, using a passive adapter to connect a DVI monitor to a GPU’s DisplayPort connection will essentially cause that DisplayPort output to communicate with the “language” of DVI. As far as the GPU is concerned, it does not have a DisplayPort monitor connected, and therefore cannot leverage the benefits that DisplayPort enables (e.g. AMD Eyefinity technology).  In contrast, active adapters will actively translate the DVI signal coming from the monitor into a native DisplayPort signal for the GPU (and vice versa). A native DisplayPort signal is required for AMD Eyefinity because DisplayPort signals can be synchronized by the GPU to keep all of your monitors moving in concert.  This DisplayPort signal can also be synchronized with DVI and HDMI signals, but only two of these signals may be utilized on an AMD Radeon™ GPU. This is why AMD Eyefinity technology requires a native DisplayPort signal for the third (or higher) monitor.   ",™

t5_2qkeh,neilplatform1,1358445709,"http://www.bpmlegal.com/tmgloss.html#t  &gt;Tarnishing / Tarnishment - use of a mark in a way which would bring disrepute to the mark. Tarnishment is a form of trademark dilution. For example, Mattel has brought many cases against strippers using the name ""Barbie Doll"" on the grounds that associating their ""Barbie"" mark with that industry tarnishes their famous mark.   http://www.microfilmmaker.com/tipstrick/Issue26/LegOnSt4.html&gt;Tarnishment  &gt;Unlicensed use of famous trademarks can get filmmakers into trouble when the trademark is depicted in a vulgar or disparaging context. In such an instance, the trademark owners can sue for tarnishment. To be tarnished, a trademark must be both famous and cast in an unflattering or unseemly light. One such case arose when the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders® successfully sued the makers of the adult film “Debbie Does Dallas” for using the cheerleader’s trademarked uniforms in the context of a pornographic movie. &gt; &gt;However, not every negative reference to a trademarked good must be cleared by the good’s manufacturer. Trademark law must yield to the First Amendment, and thus using trademarks to convey information, news, or for comparative advertising, is usually permitted. For example, the makers of Caterpillar® brand bulldozers sued Disney when their machines appeared in the film “George of the Jungle 2” and were described as “deleterious dozers” and “maniacal machinery.” The court sided with Disney, and the case settled. The point here for independent filmmakers to remember is not just that Disney won, but that they got sued in the first place. &gt;",®

I love it how they assume that all power will be removed from  you and placed into the hands of some traffic overlord. How about if you got in the car and you could set start and end points and... wait for it... diversions on the route so you could go exactly where you damn well please? Crazy idea, I know.  I think the ownership model is fast becoming outdated for a lot of areas - media consumption being one - and hopefully attitudes will begin to shift once the advantages become ever more clear.   Hopefully if we package it as a fleet of personal taxis, 'mycabs®' if you will, then that'll be close enough to a service that people already understand that it will make the transition a little more smooth.",®

t5_2ryd5,CHollman82,1358464544,"&gt;Pfft. But the idea that what created those things is also necessarily subject to them is rational?  They are not created... they are not objects, they are the necessary byproducts of identification. The foundation of formal logic is the identity property, that something is itself and nothing else, A = A and A != B.  If you throw out logic (as you are attempting to do here) then anything is anything, A = B, A = Chicken, A = Γ°♀⌡!... anything, all rules are gone, anything is fair game... this gets us nowhere, we might as well grunt at each other like cavemen. Communication breaks down if we ignore the law of identity, which is the foundation for formal logic.  Earlier you said that God could make a boulder so heavy that he could not lift it... and then he would lift it.  That's equivalent to saying that black is white, up is down, loud is red, soft is high, angry is moose, the black cat flies at midnight...  It's gibberish, nonsense.

It's not wingdings.  Also, we can observe chickens. We can even eat them.  But you can't eat God. He's just not spaghetti :(. Perhaps God made no method by which to rationally explain his attributes specifically to avoid being potentially eaten. Something to think about. So is ""anything is anything."" Are we talking about general relativity now? Next you'll be telling me the big bang didn't actually happen it just looks like it did. Snore.  Also I'm not throwing out logic, I just refuse to see the necessity of applying it where it isnt irrelevant.  &gt;If you insist on making nonsensical arguments then we cannot effectively communicate.

t5_2vetx,xthecharacter,1358469091,"&gt; Not 100% sure what you mean by this but you do know that ~50% of domestic abuse cases have the woman as the attacker yeah?  Sure, but men on average are stronger than women on average, so I think men have greater potential to harm women than vice-versa, and domestic abuse is only part of the picture.  &gt; Again I disagree. I don't think it's socially acceptable for either gender to do things that are considered creepy. The mere fact they're considered creepy indicates they're not socially acceptable.  Your disagreement is debatable, but just because something is ""creepy"" doesn't mean that 1) society as a whole views it as creepy and 2) that society condemns it. They *shouldn't* be socially acceptable, but they may be. I think the lyrics to tons of massively popular pop songs are creepy, but society still accepts them.  Check page 18 of: http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf  And http://www.slc.edu/offices-services/security/assault/statistics.html.  You're right, none of these explicitly say that 20% of all women are raped. I remember reading this in a more recent study, but I can't seem to find it! I'll keep my eyes peeled and respond again if I do. Either way, the rates are way too high.  &gt; And when a woman tells a guy, ""you're gorgeous"", her thoughts are 100% pure?  Not my point, but I see yours.  &gt; Women do the exact same thing and quite frankly the assumption they don't is sexist. Women are just as much sexual creatures as men are. We're all humans and we all enjoy sex. All statements like yours do is perpetuate the myth that women aren't allowed to like sex, and shit like this...  I don't think that, culturally, women prey on men in a sexual way in the same way that men prey on women in a sexual way. You're welcome to disagree. Men/women are both sexual creatures, but we have different drives and attitudes towards that sexuality. IMO, women more often enjoy/want stable sexual relationships more than men, and men more often enjoy/want having lots of sex with different people more than women. (To me this makes biological sense, because women are more physically tied to caring for and raising children (since they carry them in their bodies) and men are more physically tied to the act of having sex, for the sake of genetic variation...this could be inaccurate though, and is not something I'm committed to believing. But I do think that the male/female cocktails of hormones contribute to some kind of on-average difference of this sort.) Of course individual people won't necessarily match this generalization, and I'm not at all saying that women aren't allowed to like sex. They are allowed to not like sex, though, and they are definitely allowed to not like unwanted sexual advances.   This understanding is anecdotal; it's just something I've experienced. Maybe your experiences differ. Thanks for sharing your perspective.  &gt; ...Just sounds extremely patronising and kinda pathetic.  Wasn't trying to be patronizing. Sorry bout that. Why is it pathetic, though?  &gt; You strike me as the stereotypical ""Nice Guy™"" type.  Whoops? Look, I have just seen guys do fucked up things to girls who dress sexily because, well, they enjoy dressing sexily. I have seen them get a lot of undeserved negative attention, and it bothers me. I have even seen this happen to girls who dress totally reasonably, just because they're seen as attractive. I'm not trying to say that you or anyone else in particular is doing something wrong. I just think it's kind to err on the side of caution, because I feel bad for girls who are in this situation. I'm not saying to sabotage your own self in the process. I certainly don't.  \*edited\* for clarity.",™

Everything about it feels like a website from the 90s. I cannot suggest anything that could save this design.  If you were still working on the website (which I'm assuming you aren't since it was made for a client some time ago), my suggestion would be to start from scratch. Look at some web design/development-based blogs and websites and try to get a feel for modern web design concepts and aesthetics.

Give them drugs which would block those negative feelings, and then they should be fine™  But that doesnt solve the REAL problem. Your brain still perceives those negative feelings from the environment, yet you cannot act on them because they become blocked in the mind.

Secondly, I was going to save this one for review 40 and do a back-to-back with the PC7, but today was a very good day for me so I decided to celebrate with a more *non-pedestrian* bottle. I was accepted into law school and will be going back to university! As a 30-something year old man-child, I'm quite terrified of going back to school, but hopefully I'll fit right in because I'm down with the cool kids and I know all the internet slang. I'll probably post a lot less here so I can concentrate on my studies, but the most likely scenario is that I'll still be on here all day and end up getting kicked out of uni... Anyway, enough of this nonsense, onto the review!  **Bruichladdich Octomore 5.1, 59.5% ABV**  * Nose: Bacon fat and sweet peat smoke. Honey glazed double smoked ham and pig fat dripping on hot charcoal. Marshmallows toasting over a bonfire. Poached pear with thick syrup. Slightly floral and mouth watering...  * Taste: Oily, viscous and tingly. Salted caramel and peanut brittle. Jerky with salted cashews and a pint of porter. Jamón ibérico with blue cheese. Drinking this is like eating a hearty meal.  * Finish: Earthy peat and sweet tobacco smoke. Nutmeg,  pepper, clove and aniseed. Long, meaty, rich and moreish.  Peated at 169ppm but not really a peat bomb... the peat is there but it's mostly hidden behind the meaty and smoky sweetness. This is an incredibly rich and delicious dram, but not as good as the Supernova which is still the reigning peat champion. Nonetheless, this is Real Scotch™  Sláinte, and excelsior!  &gt;**93/100**  Review #35, thanks for reading. ",™

t5_2s30g,A_for_Anonymous,1358515156,"Please remove your tl;dr, it does no justice to your case and makes you look abusive.  This is a serious case: even if I lived in trigger-happy murka (enjoying the Freedom™ of lethal weapons everywhere), the second some moron brings a weapon to my house in case I attack him he's banned forever from my life. For this alone, I'd be giving her an ultimatum: the coward or me — she'd have to choose. (Also, real men don't need weapons to solve problems.)  Then there's the issue of trust. A relationship is based on trust and yours doesn't have that, since your girlfriend is keeping secrets from you and seems to prefer a guy that obviously can't be trusted. And if what you've said is true, not only she's cheating emotionally (and possibly sexually, but emotional affairs are far worse IMO), but she's using you (maybe you both) to get the best from both of you. You're her bitch — good for sex and probably housing and money, while preferring that other guy's company and being completely insensitive to how you feel about the whole issue. She clearly prefers talking to that other guy; what are you doing with her?  If I were you, I'd kick her out and delete her from your life, telling her to fuck her stupid coward of a friend and his guns and to never, ever dare to contact me again in any way. Such a situation would easily damage my view of the relationship beyond repair. Have some dignity and decency as a human being: don't be anybody's doormat.",™

t5_2s6ky,greenl1ght,1358525487,"She's Japanese, I'm Swedish.  We had been following each other on Twitter (nothing special, just those random follows you get from following hashtags). I'm something of a weeaboo, and was spending the summer in a rented apartment in Tokyo, tweeting about my random experiences. She said I should come down to visit her city and she's show me around, and I promised I would. Well, down to 4 weekends left, I figured I ought to fulfill my promise.   Our tweets had been in English, but it turned out she only really spoke Japanese. My japanese is... rudimentary... at best, but we managed to communicate. She showed me around for a few days, and I flew back. Well back in Tokyo, I realized how the fun I had probably extended beyond the regular joys of travel, and when she had a daytrip to tokyo for a work seminar, I asked if we could meet for coffee before her flight back. Saying goodbye at the train station, I surprised both of us with a peck on her forehead, and needless to say next weekend I flew back down to visit again, if only for a few days before returning to Europe.  That was about a year and a half ago. Luckily, my work online and hence 100% flexible about location, so I've been able to visit her for several months at a time as far as tourist visas allow. My japanese has improved leaps and bounds and there's nothing we haven't or can't talk about, albeit sometimes with some effort (which i've promised myself I'll never shirk).   Our next step is to convince her parents that I'm not a devil trying to steal her away from them to foreign lands, and then we can consider marriage, at which point it's simple to get a visa for me to stay with her forever ♥  Long Distance hasn't been as hard on us as I expected, as we're both kind of used to being alone.

t5_2qk5q,Will_Power,1358540306,"&gt;Michaels didn't SAY global warming is nothing to worry about, he implied it by ""canceling"" the ""apocalypse"".  Wait.  So you think there will be a climate ""apocalypse""?  &gt;You not seeing the goalposts is not my moving them.  Please.  Just please.  You first define ""denier"" as someone who rejects warming over the last century or who rejects CO2 as a GHG.  When you find no one that meets that criteria, you then change it to mean someone who says there hasn't been warming over the last decade.  When you realize that that definition includes Jim Hansen, you then change it to mean someone who denies Really Bad Things™ will happen.  If you can't see how you move goal posts, then I don't think I should waste any more time on you.  &gt;See, now that you include his full quote, which provides more information it changes the meaning from ""climate change isn't real"" to ""climate change is complex but still happening"". Without the second clause adding the two different nuances, the meaning is different.  Absolutely not.  The inclusion of his explanation of causality doesn't detract from his very clear statement.

t5_2sokd,dakta,1358557439,"&gt; how do I know if Anonymous is actually behind something or not?  You're missing the point. Anonymous is not an organization, it is a movement. There are no leaders. There is no Anonymous™ telling people what to do. Everyone is anonymous, and nobody is. There are semi-organized meeting places, like the anon-ops IRC channel(s), and various Twitter feeds, but there is nothing official. The whole point is that there is nothing official, nothing central, no single entity organizing or originating ideas.  &gt; How do you know when it's the genuine group speaking out against something?  You can't, and that's the entire point. There is no ""genuine group"". There are some individuals who spend more time involved, who have more experience, who tend to originate ideas and organize things simply by virtue of knowing how to contact other users who have influence and contact other users, but that doesn't make them leaders. There are also white-, gray-, and black-hat hackers who participate in some anonymous actions. They generally keep pretty well hidden, for obvious reasons. However, they are not a unified mass.  Like I said, there is no Anonymous™. I am Anonymous just as much as you are Anonymous. Everyone is Anonymous, and nobody is. I could hop on #anonops, #telecomix, reddit, the chanboards, Twitter, and some ToR platforms right now, this very minute, and attempt to initiate an Anonymous action. Whether it goes anywhere, whether anyone listens to me, depends on whether my message reaches the right people (chance) and whether they support it or not. Only the most popular proposals get shared around enough to initiate substantial, mainstream-media–coverage–worthy responses. If I did that, though, I'd probably get the attention of a few dedicated people, who would then collaborate with me and anyone else to improve the message and then spread it around.  I really have no other way to explain it.",™

Plungers set their own personal goals of how deep to go and how long they want to stay in the water.    If you prefer to keep your feet on dry land rather than jumping into freezing water, you can still be a part of all the fun. Fundraise a minimum of $50, and you can attend the event as a ""Too Chicken to Plunge"" participant. You will join all the other ""chickens"" in the coop while you cheer on the plungers and stay warm in your commemorative T-shirt.   We love teams! Bring out your co-workers, family or friends and have fun plunging together. Teams can be any amount of people you wish!  The Polar Plunge® is a unique opportunity for individuals, families, organizations and businesses to support Special Olympics athletes by plunging into the Pacific Ocean.   All proceeds will benefit the athletes of San Diego County. By taking the Plunge, you will be helping Special Olympics Southern California reach out and provide training and sports programs for children and adults with intellectual disabilities in San Diego County.

t5_2qj5t,Wade-Pool,1358579579,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted so much, I always thought this was fairly common knowledge.   The ""toxic above body temperature"" line is bastardised from the fact that acrylic cannot be sterilised using an autoclave. The high temperatures used for proper sterilisation (120-140 °C) will melt the acrylic - simple.  ----  From [Triabalectic](http://community.tribalectic.com/articles/body-jewelry-materials):  &gt;Acrylic is probably the most well-known plastic, and there is a lot of acrylic body jewelry or accessories available. It’s inexpensive, versatile, lightweight and comes in a variety of colors. **The problem with acrylic is that it’s not autoclavable, which is the only truly safe way to sterilize body jewelry of any kind. It also degrades if it comes in contact with alcohol, so keeping a piece of acrylic jewelry clean is a challenge.** It also shatters under pressure, so things like biting down on your tongue barbell can be a real problem if you’ve got an acrylic ball on the end. Acrylic jewelry can suffocate a piercing that needs to breathe, and the end result can be redness, soreness, seeping and a bad odor. Although widely available, acrylic really is not recommended for piercings. **If you must wear it, it should only be worn short-term and only in a well-healed piercing. **  ----  From [APP's ""Choosing a piercer""](http://www.safepiercing.org/publications/brochures/choosing-a-piercer/):  &gt;When choosing what to put in a piercing, especially a fresh one, remember that jewelry quality can make a big difference in the health of the piercing. Jewelry should be polished to a mirror finish. It should be brilliant and reflective; jewelry that is dull, grey in color, or has nicks, scratches, or polishing compound on its surface should not be used. Jewelry for initial piercings should be made of material that will not react with the body: implant grade stainless steel and titanium; gold (14K or higher); or platinum. In some cases, inert plastics like Tygon® or PTFE (Teflon®) are also acceptable. Sterling silver is not appropriate for healing, and **acrylic should not be used for initial piercings**. Earring studs should never be used for anything other than earlobes.  From [APP's ""Healed Jewelry""](http://www.safepiercing.org/publications/brochures/healed-jewelry/):  &gt;Choose your jewelry to suit your lifestyle as well as your budget and aesthetic preferences:  &gt;Many alternative materials [plastics and organics] are fragile compared to metal, so jewelry with pointy or narrow areas or in thin gauges may be easily broken  &gt;They may not be safe to wear during sports or sleep, and should be removed for bathing and swimming  &gt;Adornments that are extremely heavy will seldom be appropriate for everyday wear  &gt;Etched, twisted, or matte finish items have the potential to cause irritation  ----  And lastly, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing_materials#Acrylic.2C_plexiglas):  &gt;Polymers can be light, with resistance to the body's chemical reactions and safe against most allergies. However, many polymers are absorbent and have a porous surface, which makes it necessary to often take the jewelry out and thoroughly clean or replace it to avoid infection or sensitization from residues.  &gt;Acrylic, sold as Plexiglas or any of a variety of names, is a transparent plastic, in piercing mostly used for plugs and tapers.  &gt;It is not a good material for damaged or new piercings and can not be heat sterilized by autoclave as it can melt or discolor. It is also a fragile material and can easily crack, craze or shard if dropped. Jewelry made of acrylic has a tendency to collect body fluids and skin parts in tiny pores and fissures. The Association of Professional Piercers suggests that it may only be used for temporary wear in healed piercings.  &gt;Acrylic can be a chemical irritant or allergen, resulting in Acrylic monomer dermatitis from the decomposition of methyl methacrylate.  ----  **TL;DR: Acrylic is just as safe as natural/organic materials in healed piercings; keep them clean and you're fine.** Issues can arise if you happen to be allergic to the material or if you let them become disgusting. Imagine you wear same pair of socks for as long as you wear your jewelry without cleaning them - does that thought make you feel uncomfortable? THEN WASH YOUR FUCKING PLUGS.   Edit: some words",®

t5_2qj8f,boblabon,1358613064,"There are two points they are trying to make here, that these salmon are somehow bad for your health, and they will damage the wild salmon populations if they escape their containment. Both of these points are pretty ridiculous.    The second point is the easiest to debunk. These salmon (a.k.a frankenfish) are sterile. So even if one did somehow escape it's inland farm, make her (all the GM salmon are female) way to the ocean, find a wild salmon population similar to herself, avoid any commercial fishing operations,  find enough food to eat (most farmed fish are trained to eat pellets and can't adapt to finding new food sources), and get to a salmon's spawn location, it would just swim around until it died. Notice how many IF's there are for one to even have a chance of mating even if these fish aren't completely sterile.    As for the first point, it does take some speculation since the results of the studies haven't been published yet. But most of the food we eat today (wheat, corn, potatoes, rice, bananas, beef, chicken, etc) are genetically modified. The only difference now is instead of farmers selectively breeding for certain traits in the fields over decades, we have people in lab coats doing the same thing in a fraction of the time. Also what health risks are they afraid of? Cancer? Salmonella? Feeling Down? A Dingy Aura? The only thing they are saying is ""These salmon are bad for you because... Science?"". Personally, I'd like to know the hows and whats of something before I worry. (i.e. tanning beds can induce melanoma because of increased UV radiation)  Some other stupid points:  * we won't be able to tell them apart from ""real"" salmon. Yes you will, not only will everything say Genetically Modified on it, most will have AquAdvantage® on the tag. And they are just salmon, bred to grow a bit faster with less food. It's not like they cut up parts of salmon they like and sewed it back together. * ""based on studies paid for by the company that created the GMO creature!"" Well no shit. Of course they're paying for the studies. If they want the public to think they're safe, they will pay scientists to study them and prove it. It's not like they are buying scientists like the tobacco companies did in the 50's since there are several federal regulations against that. * ""the US government will consider public opinion"" Sure they will, just like when we invaded Uganda to find that Kony guy (/s).  Yes U.S. citizens do have the right to petition the government, but I can guarantee the U.S. government gives negative fucks about what P in Finland or Crazy Clown in Brazil has to say about them.

t5_2t5sa,twr3x,1358630854,"Some things, I've always thought. I played with Barbies and action figures as a child because there weren't enough girl action figures and I wanted fair representation. Other things, not so much. I used to believe in the friend zone, I used to be a special snowflake and clamor for white people to approve of me for being sufficiently white-acting instead of just thinking of me as a person, I used to think women only liked assholes and that I was single and lonely because of them and not because of myself.  Life changed me. There were a few experiences that really shaped who I am as far as social issues are concerned. For some of them, it was making a friend. I was religious and homophobic when I started high school, and then I made gay friends and realized how stupid I was being, which set me on the path toward supporting gay rights. I didn't understand trans* issues until I made trans* friends. For others, there just finally reached a point where it was explained to me the right way. I didn't believe in rape culture until someone pointed out the ways in which it exists and showed me news stories about its results. Some, it was a compound of small moments, like all the ones it took for me to finally admit that I'm treated differently because I'm black and not because I just give off some kind of ""treat me poorly"" aura. And others still were the result of single moments.  One night in college, my fraternity had a grab-a-date, and I brought a girl who I was into more than she was into me. I drove, but I drank too much out at the bar to drive back home from the brother's house where we pregamed. Eventually, we were the only people in the living room. She called a friend to pick her up. We made out a little bit on the couch. The brother whose house it was--the president of the fraternity at the time--walked through to the kitchen and saw this going on.  When she left, my brother came back down the stairs and asked me to step outside for a smoke. He said, ""You have to be careful how you act."" I asked what he meant and he said it was pretty clear that the girl wasn't really feeling me and that us making out was the result of a sense of obligation or pressure or fear at the fact that we were alone and she had no real out. He said I needed to think of sex not as an end goal, but as something that may result from a good connection. That it's not worth any of these things happening if one of the people involved is not totally into it.  I hadn't thought of it that way before. It wasn't like I thought of women as objects or (consciously) thought of sex as existing to satisfy me. But I did think, ""Well, if I convince her to fool around, I'll make sure she enjoys it."" Typing that out makes me fucking disgusted at the kid I was before that night on the porch on Queen St. But that's what I thought. We're raised in this society to see sex as something that men want and women must be convinced to let happen, and that if you throw her a bone and get her off while she's allowing this thing, you're a good guy.  That September night when I was nineteen, my fraternity brother made me realize how shitty I had been in the past. How gross and manipulative I had been. In hindsight, I'm glad I was a Nice Guy™ of such woman-repelling fortitude that I had only had sex three times with two women up until that point, because I might have caused someone a lifetime of pain had my brother not set me straight.  It may sound ironic, but what led me to feminism was joining a fraternity.",™

Matlab’s Stateﬂow tool was used to design and generate code for the fault protection subsystem. State-ﬂow was also used to generate fault protection code for Deep Impact, which studied the results of an artiﬁcial impactor striking comet Tempel 1 in 2005.   So not only did the use autocode. They used it in the fault protection subsystem. Probably one of the most critical subsystems you have.

t5_2stj0,dracy69,1358635851,"ok a few questions.  First, do the plugs for the receiver have a small tab on them? Is it possible to plug the wires going into the rx (receiver) backwards? Make sure all of the wires are in the same orientation. If they are then check what ports you plugged them into, the rx will have at least 3. 1 2 and 3, or steering, throttle, then battery. If you have a 3 ch rx then it will be steering, throttle, aux, then battery. Make sure they are where they are supposed to be.  Second, what kind of ESC? The stock one? you could try recalibrating the throttle [Page 2:](http://traxxas.com/sites/default/files/3018R_KC1307-R00_XL5_INST.pdf)  1. Disconnect one of the motor wires between the XL-5 and the motor. This is a precaution to prevent runaway when the speed control is turned on for the first time (before it is programmed). The motor does not run during the programming sequence. If the motor wires are soldered you may leave them connected, but make sure to enter the programming mode directly (step 4) to avoid a runaway.  2. Connect a fully charged battery pack to the XL-5.  3. Turn on the transmitter (with the throttle at neutral as described above).  4. Press and hold the EZ-Set® button (A). The LED will first turn green and then red. Once the LED turns red, immediately release the EZ-Set button. The red LED will turn off after three seconds.  5. Next, the LED will blink RED ONCE. Pull the throttle trigger to the full throttle position and hold it there (B).  6. After three seconds, the LED will blink RED TWICE. Push the throttle trigger to the full reverse/brake position and hold it there (C).  7. When the LED blinks GREEN ONCE, programming is complete. The LED will then shine green or red (depending on Low-Voltage Detection setting) indicating the XL-5 is on and at neutral (D).  8. To turn the XL-5 off, press the EZ-Set button until the green LED turns off.  If you did this and this still doesn't work, then I have to ask, is your battery fully charged? A working steering servo but no throttle is a typical sign of the low voltage cut off. Seems dumb but I have to ask. If you use NiMH then turn off Low Voltage Detection.  Also, double check your motor wires. If you went through the steps above you may not have plugged the bullet connectors on all the way. If they are in the incorrect order the truck would have done something like drive backwards.  Last, take a good top down picture of your electronics so I can see what's going on.

He used to have extreme separation anxiety from me when we crated him during the day, and he tore up his bed and the crate pan, so we replaced it and sprayed it with Bitter Apple, and he has learned not to chew on it. But also thorough exercise can help curb behaviour a LOT. I bike with my pitbull, and he loves it. We go for a good fifteen minutes, then a resting and water break for a few minutes, then go for another fifteen. So, basically, destructive behaviour can be caused from seperation anxiety, boredom, and/or not enough excersise. ",®

t5_2r25p,Ametrica,1358687666,"Recently an Australian from Perth decided to measure his Subway sandwich to see if it measured 12 inches (~305 mm) or not.  It turned out, it only measured 11 in (280 mm) per the picture in the article.  Subway Australia claimed in a response that ""Footlong"" is merely creative license and does not designate measurement"".  With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'SUBWAY FOOTLONG' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway® Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length. The length of the bread baked in the restaurant cannot be assured each time as the proofing process may vary slightly each time in the restaurant.  What I also found peculiar was that an Australian teenager would actually process an inch only tape measure.  I would have expected at least a dual tape.     In addition to this why would an Australian teenager be using abandoned imperial units?  Could it be his motive had less to do with exposing Subway's undersized sandwich and more to do with giving international exposure to the metric system not being used in Australia?     Years ago I said Subway screwed themselves with fixed bread lengths.  As cost rose, they could never downsize and would have to raise prices when their competitors could offer lower prices even if they do so by having shorter sandwiches.  I did notice that Subway was able to do some downsizing by shrinking the width, but how narrow can you go?  If Subway is to survive, they will have to bite the bullet and back off from their traditional inch sizes.     I've never ever asked for a sandwich at Subway in inches.  I've always asked for small or large, most often the large size.     Maybe someone from Australia can shed light onto why this man from Perth is carrying around an inch tape measure and not metric or dual.    ",®

t5_2qhcz,LesMisIsRelevant,1358691487,"Well then, let me take over this woozy perspective with some Science™, _bitches_. OP, try a little variation on a nifty little thing called _cognitive reappraisal_.   Science bases what I'm about to describe on three things: one, our brain has a tendency to make sure visualization is prioritized above and overrides our reason, and second, a brain is almost completely incapable of separating vivid fantasy from reality. Third, writing something down has a more lasting neutralizing effect on your emotions than just thinking it.  That kept in mind, let's move on.  You say you hold grudges, right? Well, the following technique has been observed to relieve year-long held grudges more effectively than years of therapy.   That's right, I'm offering you an easier, quicker, more believable and more effective treatment than any of what is stated in the above post. Read right on to find out what it is.  Follow these quick and easy steps to get your very own peace of mind:  1. Think of a person that has wronged you. 2. Write them a letter, preferably handwritten, in which you detail exactly what you wish you could say to them and sign it, leaving absolutely nothing filtered or censored. Remember, this is your fantasy.  3. Write back a letter to yourself, in their name, in which they tell you precisely what you want to hear.

After you've finished this letter, sign it as well, again in their name. 4. Read back this second letter every night before you go to bed over the course of a week. By the end of the week, you'll notice that, even upon meeting them in person, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing.

For me the difference is undeniable.  For some little difference is noticed, however for those who try it I have found few go back to ice regularly.

Bowles VINE™ VOICE  Format:Paperback  This is a book that takes you into the life of young Michael Fraser, who after committing robbery and murder at the tender age of 15 finds himself in an adult maximum security prison to serve out the term of his sentence. He is taken under the wing of the resident Moslems who run the place, and all is well for a number of years. He converts to Islam, but only for convenience sake, correctly recognizing that ingratiating himself with the group will afford him protection within the prison walls. But there is one cardinal rule that leader Mustafa insist that all of the brothers follow; that you are strong, and do not engage in any sexual anomalies. Michael is fine with this initially...but years go by and hormones kick in....and Michael spots Dee Dee, a preop transsexual who is the closest thing to a woman that prison has to offer. Eventually Michael begins to see Dee Dee as just that, and falls in love.....but love has a price. Dee Dee's price is the death of Mustafa--he wants Michael to kill him to avenge the death of a friend of Dee Dee's--and Michael sees this as an opportunity to keep he and Dee Dee's love affair a secret from the brothers. But Dee Dee has his own agenda...  Upon his release, Michael is finally able to be with women for the first time. But he finds himself continuing to desire men, and is in a constant state of denial. The double life that he then begins to lead has tragic results for Michael and his loved ones.  I've read the other reviews, and I agree that the editing, if done at all, was certainly substandard. If this were a work of fiction, I might take issue with even more of the novel. However, the fact that this is based on a true story, done by a brother who clearly has something to say, is compelling. It gives readers a no-holds-barred look into the prison system, and what goes on within. The novel takes you into the mind of a young man who is clearly struggling with his sexual identity...and the results of his unwillingness to face reality. The sex scenes within the book between the men is real, and raw...I saw a couple of kid reviews for this book and wondered where their parents are, as clearly this novel is rated R. 3 stars only for the editing issues...but the story itself is at least a 4. With a better publishing house, I see this as an author with quality novels in his future.  DYB",™

Don't read if your eyeballs might burn.**  &gt;Unfairly being assumed to be a pedophile; &gt;Unfairly assumed to be a potential rapist;  I'll just toss in that as a gay guy, it may depend on one's particular area but many of us have to deal with a lot of this sort of thing from both men and women.  Some types of guys, usually uneducated ones who've had a very small existence, are intensely paranoid that I and other gays are going to touch them or their children inappropriately or attempt to rape them.  The kicker is that even putting the typically frumpy &amp; blah looks aside, this is usually also coming from the type of person whom I would never in a million years want to be intimate/sexual with in any way based on personality alone, let alone even entertaining the concept of forced sex/rape in general.  And pedophilia????  Really???!! This isn't the 1950s anymore, moral witch-hunts &amp; inquisitions laced with McCarthyesque kangaroo court accusations have fallen out of fashion, or are you still living in that era in your mind?  &gt;Unjust gender based social expectations  I'll also add that on many subsets of the scene, as a rule gay men have to deal with an added layer of crazy sexual politics, gender-role-shoehorning, judgement and stereotyping based on the top/bottom, butch/femme,  dom/sub dichotomy model, both from those on the hetero and homo ends of the spectrum as well as males and females who fit within the entire LGBTQ demographic.  We also have to tolerate annoyingly patronizing token-gay-friend-type behavior from folks all over the gender spectrum and being paraded around like a specimen in a jar or like a dog on a leash as testament to the trope that one can't possibly be prejudiced because they have a gay-friend-accessory™.   Relatedly yet tangentially: I was at a party, just hanging out, having casual conversation, enjoying a few drinks and surfing from group to group.  The subject gets onto relationships.  The subject comes up that I happen to be gay.  I'm not closeted but I don't make a big deal out of it either.  These three twentysomething girls hop on me squeeling something to the effect of ""OOOOOOH THIS IS SOOOOO COOOOL, WE HAVE A GAY FRIEND NOW...."" and they start gushing this crap about taking me shopping with them to compare clothes, makeup,  and gawking at boys and stuff.... I cut them off with the dirtiest look possible and promptly left that particular niche in the party. Despite their best intentions, I was insulted at being a cartoon character stereotype in these girls' minds.  I have no problem with my less-stereotypically masculine LGBTQ brothers/sisters but understand that I'm a guy who works the land, repairs his own equipment, harvests his own food &amp; firewood, builds things, has an appreciation for pragmatic application of architecture &amp; landscape design and I am demi-sexual as well as introverted.  Regardless of the femme streak in my personality, I'm not particularly interested in any activities having to do with what could be considered stereotypical female culture tropes and I especially have absolutely no use for the world of fashion, cruising for guys or going to shopping malls. None of those things are in my identity lexicon and it's myopic to assume that they should be.  /rant  **tl;dr: NO, grow a fucking attention span.**  **Edit:** *typos, punctuation, nitpicky details.*",™

Other products I've tried:  * Jen's Green Tea Shea Cleanser - not bad!  * Creamy Matcha Cleanser - not as easy to spread, was okay  * Gentle Cleansing Gel - very basic and affordable  * Banana Healing Serum - felt nice, didn't heal my irritated chest skin much though, and I dislike banana scented things  * Encapsulated Glacier Water - I like my juniper hydrosol better, but nice if you want something very basic to hydrate  * Cafe Antiox - hard to get a single drop out of the fliptop bottle, but too thick for a dropper, was okay  * Decadent Oat Enriched Cream - I actually liked the ""pungent"" scent, and it was really nice, but the price was really high ($7.65/0.25oz~!) but I'm thinking of buying it again  * Classic Azule w/Emu Oil Cream - Been using it only for about 5 days.  It's okay but a bit tricky to mix in with an HA.  I liked the oat cream better, but this is WAY cheaper.  * Some Kind of Glow detox - seems to be helping with chest redness  and bumps, too early to tell so I withhold judgment  * Cocofen with basil tonic - My initial reaction was, ""Oh no!  I smell like a party hor dourve!""  But I'm wondering if this is what's helping with my chest irritation and not the detox serum...  * Cloudberry antiox gel - I dunno, didn't notice anything exciting  * Coconut revival cream - OH NO! I didn't know coconut cream can cause breakouts.  It took me a week to clear up. :( Now I just use it on my shoulders.  * Hyaluronic acids - I love all of them, and they last forever!  Blue Mallow and Myrrh are my favorites, the green tea one is very thick in comparison.  * Avocado oil - ♥  * Pineapple wine exfoliating gel - Initially alarmed because it was bubblegum pink and smelled kind of bubblegummy too.  It gets the job done though and seems nice enough.  No miracles.  * 5% Mandelic Acid - I like this.  I'll keep using it.  **TL;DR - I think I have a problem.**",♥

t5_2va9w,VolcanicBakemeat,1358791159,"Evolution happens by speciation, wherein different populations of a species accumulate different traits until they are too different from the rest of the species to breed and produce viable offspring.  As you know, all organisms share ancestry with all other organisms if you go back far enough. Any two species will share a Most Recent Common Ancestor, this is the last individual organism in history which contributed genes to BOTH species you're tracking. On the tree I posted, the MRCA for humans and all monkeys and apes is to be found at the branch where *Simiiformes* branches into *Catarrhini* and *Platyrrhini* - though since there are some monkeys in *Catarrhini* you might wish to consider the final branch as the Human-Monkey MRCA.  Obviously, the MRCA is a species which existed millenia ago and no longer exists **✝**, so I can't describe it to you - but scientists can and have used fossil, genetic and archaeological evidence along with a healthy dose of logic to come up with some pretty good estimates which you can read about in Richard Dawkins' book *The Ancestors Tale*, which focuses on moving backwards from *Homo sapiens* to the dawn of life in a series of MRCA steps.  **✝**Okay, feasibly, some 'ancestor' creatures can be left relatively unchanged across millions of years if there is no selective pressure on them to change, as with crocodiles and coelocanths. Evolutionarily, you could visualise new species ""budding off"" of their branch of the tree rather than the tree splitting in two. This is not, however, the case with primates.  **Too sciency, didn't read:**  **In simple terms, apes didn't ""come from"" monkeys or vice versa; both apes and monkeys came from an ancient creature that was neither but gave rise to both.**",✝

By the end of the week, you'll notice that, even upon meeting them in person, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing.

The concept has always bothered me long before I could put my finger on it. It's a semi-common joke about straight guys being jealous of the attention gay men get from women (it's certainly been used as a plot in romcoms more than once). More I thought about it the more I felt pity for the gay man shoehorned into the role, getting massive amounts of attention and stereotypes from the gender he's least interested in.  I swear every girl I knew in college absolutely *had* to prove she was hip and urbane by frequenting one of the only gay bars in a very conservative college town in Texas. It felt... wrong?

t5_2qh2p,kestrelthehistorian,1358798779,"It was founded on Enlightenment ideas.  Voltaire, Montesquieu, etc.  It was most assuredly not founded on religious ideas.    The first thing you should do is ask your teacher what these references are.  There are only two that I can think of off the top of my head and neither prove much of anything.    Once you have that evidence, gather other evidence.  Where does the Constitution mention religion?  What are other documents that might shed some light on this subject.  Once all of that has been acquired, start evaluating the evidence as a whole.  Are there references to the supernatural in the Constitution?  Very few, but sure.  Yet, when taken into context with all of the evidence (spoiler alert) you will find that those references are incidental and that the Constitution itself, in addition to other documentation, actively seeks to disengage government from religion.    When you go further and examine the lives of the more influential of the Founding Generation you will see a strong vein of secularism.    Also, keep in mind that these people were operating in a time previous to the theory of evolution and modern cosmology.  While Christianity seemed far-fetched to many of them, SOMETHING had to have created the world and the argument from design was a powerful concept, if only in the deistic, non-interventionist sense.  For someone like Jefferson ""Creator"" did not necessarily mean the god of the Christians.  In fact it is very likely he did not mean that.    Regardless, even were there evidence supporting the idea that the Founding Generation wanted a Christian Country™ based on Christian Values™ it is irrelevant.  We have since read the First Amendment to mean that there is the separation of church and state.  What they wanted in that first generation is interesting to study, but not really (in my opinion, and I am obviously not a strict-constructionist or believe in the original intent doctrine) relevant to how we use the Constitution today.    If you really want to trip your teacher up (politely), move the debate from religion to original intent and if we should be bound by that concept.  They likely have a ton of ready arguments fed to them by David Barton for the religiosity of the Founders, but not as much for the original intent argument.    Also, fuck David Barton.  ",™

OP, try a little variation on a nifty little thing called cognitive reappraisal.   Science bases what I'm about to describe on three things: one, our brain has a tendency to make sure visualization is prioritized above and overrides our reason, and second, a brain is almost completely incapable of separating vivid fantasy from reality. Third, writing something down has a more lasting neutralizing effect on your emotions than just thinking it.  That kept in mind, let's move on.  You say you hold grudges, right? Well, the following technique has been observed to relieve year-long held grudges more effectively than years of therapy.   That's right, I'm offering you an easier, quicker, more believable and more effective treatment than any of what is stated in the above post. Read right on to find out what it is.  Follow these quick and easy steps to get your very own peace of mind:  Think of a person that has wronged you. Write them a letter, preferably handwritten, in which you detail exactly what you wish you could say to them and sign it, leaving absolutely nothing filtered or censored. Remember, this is your fantasy. Write back a letter to yourself, in their name, in which they tell you precisely what you want to hear. Be it an apology, an explanation, appreciation -- everything you feel you'd need in reality to stop feeling resentment towards them. After you've finished this letter, sign it as well, again in their name. Read back this second letter every night before you go to bed over the course of a week. By the end of the week, you'll notice that, even upon meeting them in person, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing. You will be able to treat them as if they've righted their wrong, because even though perhaps you don't cognitively believe it, you do feel that emotional satisfaction and relief. Now then, did you know that many placebos work even when the patient knows he's being deceived? This is one of those placebos. Hilariously, I can explain in full detail that you're tricking your mind, and it'll work all the better because of it.  Relevant studies I can share upon request. (Or, you could read The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane.) And don't mind me using infomercial-type communication; I'm just having a jolly good time.  N.B.: Science™: it works, bitches!  ",™

t5_2t160,PerspicaciousPedant,1358821818,"&gt; I've heard the bushmaster described as a varmint gun...  Well, there are at least two things that might be going on here.  First, is that someone might have a slightly larger definition of ""varmint"" than I do.  Foxes? Coyotes? Feral Dogs? Wolves? All of those could be classified as ""varmints,"" and would be more humanely put down by a .223 Remington than a .22Long.  Alternately, some people just use overkill.  [Edit:  Another possibility?  They may call it that to offer a clearly legitimate purpose other than the charged, frankly propagandist, term ""assault weapon""]  &gt; why we're arming soldiers with varmint guns  Well, we kind of are, and kind of aren't.  For one thing, just because the ammo is the same doesn't mean the gun is the same.  For example, you're familiar with the [Tommy Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun), right?  That uses the same exact round as the [1911 Colt Semiautomatic Pistol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol), but they're *clearly* not the same weapon.  So while it may be said that they're using a varmint round, when you can literally fire off somewhere upwards of 6 rounds in a single second, that makes a bit of a difference.  Next, take into account that as a caliber of choice to drive off feral dogs, coyotes, and wolves.  Human beings are not much tougher than your average wolf, and it could be argued that we are less so.  As a result, given the 1500+ J of energy being transfered, even with a ""bulletproof"" vest, somebody who gets hit with even *one* of those rounds is not going to be having their best day ever.  Will their body armor allow them to survive? Probably.  Will they be able to shrug it off like they do in the movies?  Not so much.  A .223 to the shoulder *can* kill (brachial artery), and even if it doesn't, can easily result in the loss of that arm.  Third, the smaller round that has comparable efficacy at neutralizing threats allows for more ammunition to be carried per soldier.   When a soldier is only really capable of towing around 60-80 pounds of gear maximum, (warning: made up numbers forthcoming) would it be better that they carry 200 rounds capable of neutralizing an enemy, or 150?  If Bad Stuff™ happens, as it often does in combat situations, US and NATO Militaries decided that it would be better to have something like 33% more rounds, each with a 15% lower probability of stopping the enemy than the other way around.  &gt; one-handing shotguns and shooting targets  I'm not certain I can comment on that.  At least, not in an educated fashion.   I could *speculate* that they may have been smaller bore shotguns ([higher gague number](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-90b9pG-SyBI/Ts_VcPv7S0I/AAAAAAAAAGU/dOr3Ol97M2g/s1600/bore_size_shotgun_gauge.gif)), resulting in less energy being discharged.  I could also speculate that the larger bore may result in less ""kick"" for a given amount of energy.  I might speculate that the accuracy of a shotgun is not truly comparable given that shot (lots of pellets) expand, resulting in hits being scored despite unconrolable aim.   ...but all that is just that, speculation.  I simply don't know enough about the weapons in question, nor shotguns in general.  &gt; Finally, thanks. I try real hard to be reasonably informed about stuff, but theres a lot of stuff to learn, so it's always nice when people will actually take the time to try and help. I also find it's good for facilitating discourse  You're quite welcome, and thank *you!*   I love sharing what knowledge I have.  It seems to me that a lot of the people who are trying to significantly change how firearms are dealt with in the US do so not simply in ignorance of what they mean to regulate, but precisely *because* of the ignorance.  Kind of like how you know it's foolish to turn hard to starboard to avoid a collision on your port quarter (in certain circumstances).",™

For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? ~2 Corinthians 6:14 (NIV ©1984)  She may not understand why this rule exists (though her pastor can likely BS enough of a reason to convince her over anything you can say), but the rule is in the Bible and it must be followed even if she didn't have a reason.  THIS is why she's angry. I'm willing to bet on it. Even if she ends up deciding she loves him too much to let him go, her parents and/or church and/or friends will probably force her to. He's suddenly behind an immovable wall, and there's nothing she can do about it.  As far as what you can do about the situation...I'm not sure there is anything, other than convincing her to discard her beliefs, the attempt of which will probably cause more problems than it will solve at this point.  I won't recommend a course of action for you, as that would require me to know a lot more about you and her than you should ever reveal to internet people, but I hope at least knowing what she is thinking will help you decide for yourself what to do.",©

t5_2qh2s,Bagelson,1358854894,"I'll assume you're looking to create a game for your group, rather than to *publish* your RPG. I'll also assume you're going to use an existing rule set. Additionally, I'll assume that you have an original setting in mind, and not just ""I want to play Dresden Files the Game"".  **What's your concept?**   Sit down and define what exactly is the defining concept of your setting. What makes it stand out from Generic Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Urban Fantasy Setting #305? Distil it into short snippets and write them down. ""I want a setting...""  * ""...where magic is the manipulation of colour components of light."" * ""...where magic is fuelled and defined by various metals."" * ""...that's basically Space Race: The Game in 2150."" * ""...where super heroes rule the world.""  At this point you may want to look over existing games. There are many great games with many great settings out there, and it can be easier to just adapt something existing than to create your stuff from scratch.  **What's the theme?**   What kind of feeling do you want the setting to instil in the players? Do you want your setting to be dark and gritty, or pulpy and fantastic? Should players feel that fighting should only be a last resort, and a matter of life and death; or should bursting through the windows of the Evil Kings™ throne room to take on his guards 3 vs 1 be a perfectly viable option?  Take Steampunk for instance. It can be described as an oppressive world, where the sun is dimmed by eternal smog and ruthless constables stalk the streets to forcefully conscript layabouts. It can be described as a fantastic world where noble adventurers race airships to the Orient, fighting air-pirates along the way and solving the murder of the Indian Governor's nephew for fun. It can be anything in between.  **What does the *concept* result in?**   (Keep the theme in mind here.) You can start from the other direction as well; what resulted in the *concept*? Is colour-magic just a part of the world that has been used forever, like a natural law; is metal-magic the result of a God-Emperor reshaping the world according to his whims; do the nations have to escape Earth because resources are about to run out or because alien invaders are about to arrive?  What is the effect of all this? Do people attribute the existence of magic to some divine power and naturally elevate magicians to a ruling class, supposedly inspired by divine will? Are nations collapsing from internal pressures and riots as the doom of the world approaches, or do they band together and the PCs have to combat isolated subversive elements?  **Then the rest?**   With all this in mind, pick out a system that works with your setting. Both the concept and the theme should have mechanical support. A setting where fighting is deadly should have a system different from a setting where heroic swashbuckling is the norm.  Then start fleshing out details. What are the nations, how do their respective histories relate and what are their current relationships? Who are the movers and shakers of this world? Focus on the areas that will matter to the PCs. Nobody cares about the intricacies of the rise to power of Queen Malin of Zenobia, if the entire campaign is going to be set in the capital city of Amarr.  Once you have a level of detail you're comfortable with for the players, keep fleshing out the rest of the setting to your heart's content. Either because you want ideas for additional campaigns, or just because you think it's fun.",™

t5_22i0,archibald_tuttle,1358857502,"&gt;Das wort hat seinen Internet Subkultur Punk längst verloren spätestens seit ""Internet Gurus"" wie Sascha Lobo darüber vorträge hielten.  Zeitungen sind darauf angewiesen, dass sie eine Sprache sprechen die ihre Leser verstehen. Also ist es nicht sehr sinnvoll dass sie einen Begriff für ""heftiger Aufruhr im Netz"" verwenden, den noch keiner kennt. Letztendlich hat die deutsche Presse hier ein neues Phänomen entdeckt (Menschen empören sich schnell und heftig im Netz), da war es vermutlich sehr gelegen dass da noch ein passender Begriff daherkam: Englisch, weil das Netz ja irgendwie auch Englisch ist und dann noch Fäkalsprache, weil die Qualität der Beiträge in einem S. als eher niedrig eingeschätzt wurde. Shitstorm ist meinem Empfinden der Begriff, wenn sich irgendjemand im Netz über irgend einen Scheiß furchtbar aufregt, ein Protest dagegen ist das was der Printleser™ macht wenn bei ihm nebenan Bäume gefällt werden sollen.  Auch wenn ich kein ausgesprochener Lobo-Fan bin: Damals, als er zum Ziel eines S. im ureigentlichen Sinn wurde (Trollerei pur) hat er sich nach außen ruhig verhalten und am Ende sogar noch davon profitiert.

Left eye and Right eye. Practice   Rule #1 with a pistol..get one that is comfortable to use. Whether or not it has safeties doesn't matter with training and putting rounds down range.   I love the 1911 for the simple design. Generally it has 2 ""safeties""..thumb and grip. The trigger doesn't work without depressing the grip safety..and the thumb safety is intuitive in my opinion.   For some people,the 1911 platform ""feels"" better because it's almost like an extension of your hand. Those same people may not like the Block® guns because they don't ""point"" right.   Not every 1911 has to be the government 5"" barrel. They make 1911 style pistols as small as the Glock 26/27. Even smaller with something like the SIG P238. Great handling gun too, I own one. SIG cost me more than my 5"" government 1911 made by RIA..but I don't mind carrying either one.

t5_2qh6c,PaedragGaidin,1358866296,"&gt; The fundamentalist started ranting about Muslims taking over, prayer being illegal in schools, and evolution.  That right there, unfortunately, is a sign that you won't be able to reason with this person. He, like too many Christians in America these days, subscribes to a persecution complex that tells him that Real Christianity™ (read: a small subset of Fundamentalism, largely confined to America, that regards all other churches as ""not Christian enough"") is under siege by a vast left-wing conspiracy of atheists, feminists, gays, abortionists, and/or radical Muslims, which seeks to stomp Real Christianity™ into the ground, brainwash Real Christian™ children into secular humanist hedonist God-hating gays, ban the Bible and prayer, close churches, and/or impose shariah law. He has likely never wanted for food, clothing, shelter, education, or medical care, and has likely never experienced real persecution (you know, like [this](http://ikjnews.com/?p=175), or [this](http://www.christiantoday.com/article/muslims.attack.christians.in.egypt/31496.htm)).   In my experience, it's generally pointless to continue arguing with these people; they'll continue believing that evolution is a Satanic lie and that the Democrats are preparing America for an Islamic takeover in spite of anything you might say.   Miracles *do* happen. It doesn't mean every event we can't explain is a miracle. I also suspect that in this case, the most likely explanation is that the lady was never having a stroke, merely the symptoms of one, which can be caused by a variety of things.

No but seriously this is the root of the problem right here. It's all about your state wants to be the #1 state for education, and your high school wants to be the #1 high school in the state, etc. Which on the one hand is kind of commendable, but you get caught in that loop. You need to have the best schools, and then to retain your best status, and our only metric for measuring a school's worth is test scores. So instead of actually teaching kids it's test scores, test scores, test scores.  When I was in high school I actually got to see the school district's plan for PSSA scores from my junior year through to 2020, and what percentage of students they wanted reaching what levels. And the rate of ascension in the percentages was really radical and, given historic numbers, unlikely. I asked my guidance counselor why the numbers jumped like that and she said it was because the schools who perform better get more money, so the school district was looking to maximize funding.   And this right here is the other big issue. *Why the fuck* would you give **more** money to the school that does **good**? A school which performs poorly is not necessarily broke, but it is more likely that schools with lesser budgets will not be up to the standard of those like my old high school (which, btw, was named one of the top 1k public high schools in the US last year, so maybe they're hitting their goals after all). By robbing these schools of funding you're engendering a system of preserving the status quo. If you reverse it, so the school which does poorly receives more funding, they may be able to hire better teachers or get some actual god-damned textbooks. Or even just preserve basic infrastructure.",™

Edit: Also, since I am Monsanto, this is from our corporate website.  ""Can a farmer be sued when a small amount of GM crop seed blows into a neighbor’s fields? Do you sue this farmer? Does he or she have to prove he or she is innocent?  It has never been, nor will it be, Monsanto policy to exercise its patent rights where trace amounts of our patented traits are present in farmers’ fields as a result of inadvertent means. We have no motivation to conduct business in this manner, nor have we ever attempted to conduct business in this manner -- and we surely would not prevail in the courts if we did.  If a suspected instance of a farmer violating our technology agreements or patent rights is reported to us, we do not automatically assume a farmer has intentionally acted in an unethical or criminal manner. The burden of proof is not on the farmer. Instead, the burden of proof is on Monsanto to investigate the legitimacy of these claims and to resolve the issue as quickly and fairly as possible, which usually does not lead to litigation.  It is patently false that Monsanto sues farmers for the accidental presence of our technology in their crops. This misperception likely began with Percy Schmeiser, who was brought to court in Canada by Monsanto for illegally saving Roundup Ready® canola seed. Mr. Schmeiser claims to this day the presence of Monsanto technology in his fields was accidental, even though three separate court decisions, including one by the Canadian Supreme Court, concluded his claims were false. A review of the evidence presented in court makes it very clear Mr. Schmeiser’s claims are not credible.

t5_2qpp6,glabius,1358901485,"Okay. Let me first start my reply off with the fact that you are explicitly asking me to do ALL of your research for you when your research on the contrary is a webmd post? Please.   Secondly, their is SUBSTANTIAL archaeological evidence that hunter-gathers were WAY healthier than their agricultural counterparts. They had better bones, muscles, teeth, height, etc. etc. etc. A simple google search will show you this. THIS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS FACT IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  Ironic that you say ""Most of these claims wouldn't stand up to scrutiny of a first year undergrad anthropology student, let alone experts in the field."" Because although I am not an anthropology student, my undergrad course in anthropology has already gone over the interesting differences between hunter-gather and agricultural health. (hint: the hunter-gathers are better)   Thirdly, these facts are highly disputed by ""experts"" because it completely goes against the philosophy we have talked about for years. Oh shit, processed food is terrible for you? Thats a lot of money lost to food corporations, and as a result a lot of lost money for the pharmaceutical companies who prescribe cholesterol/blood pressure/other medicines that are a result of poor diet.  ""There is no intentionality in evolution, and all species alive today faced millions of years of simply being able to turn biological sources into energy. We can usually measure that through calories. We can also measure biological nutritional needs by looking at diseases that come through deficiencies. Trying to hand-wave claims about what's ""ideal"" or ""optimum"" tend to lack falsifiability and evidence in general.""  This statement has nothing to back it up, literally has no substance to the claim, and is actually quite wrong. Certain animals have evolved to eat certain things. Fact1: Modern humans as a species begins around ~250,000 years ago. How many years have been spent as agricultural? ~10,000, and even then, many people not in the centers of large population were exposed to this agricultural. What the fuck do you think humans are more evolved for, a diet that they ate for 240,000 years? (not including the years of humanoid species that came before homo sapiens) Or a diet that has increasingly become more and more unnatural over time.   The statement above does not necessarily mean that the diet that we are recommended is bad, HOWEVER with the realization that most of what we eat currently WAS NEVER EATEN FOR 95% OF THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SPECIES. In fact I would venture to say that most of what we eat now was not even available 100 years ago.    since you can't do your own research:   sources: http://nature.berkeley.edu/miltonlab/pdfs/backbasics.pdf  http://nature.berkeley.edu/miltonlab/pdfs/diet_primate_evolution.pdf  http://ncp.sagepub.com/content/25/6/594.full.pdf+html  http://www.direct-ms.org/pdf/EvolutionPaleolithic/Eaton%20Paleo%20Nutri%20Review%20EJCN.pdf  good quote because you seem possibly too dumb to read any of these i'll point out some things  ""Two other features of reconstituted Paleolithic nutrition little in accord with contemporary nutritional theory are its content of ®ber and protein, both much above current recommendations. Regarding these nutrients, it must be re-emphasized that Stone Agers subsisted almost exclu- sively on game and wild plant foods; there were no domesticated animals (for dairy foods) and signi®cant use of cereal grains began only about 15 000 y agoÐlate in evolutionary terms. Given the nutritional properties of game (high in protein relative to energy) and uncultivated plants (high in ®ber relative to energy), a preagricultural diet would necessarily have had high protein, high ®ber, or both. If the average plant:animal subsistence ratio was 65:35, a 30% protein, 100 g ®ber diet emerges. This near inescapable result seems strange to us today because we are used to diets containing large amounts of `empty' calories, such as sugar, highly re®ned ¯our, and nonessential fat. It is actually diets of this sort which are novel""   Here's another part that basically refutes most modern ideas. People say eating dietary cholesterol is bad and will cause a myriad of problems but here  ""Saturated fatty acids are calculated to have provided about 6% of the average total energy intake for Paleolithic humans (Eaton, 1992). Their cholesterol intake is estimated at 480 mg/d, unavoidable when game makes up a third of the nutrition base, and their overall fat intake is projected at 20±25% total energy Table 1), intermediate between the frequently lauded traditional (c. 1960) Japanese (11%) and Mediterranean (37%) patterns (Willett, 1994).""  How come paleolithic humans didn't die from high cholesteral...................................................................  ""Despite high dietary cholesterol intake, foragers studied in this century have manifested very `low' serum cholesterol levels, averaging around 3.2 mmol/L (125 mg/dL) (Eaton et al, 1988),""  Exactly. There are many other points that show that the USDA standards (put foward by the government, which I guess you have full trust in when 60% of our population is overweight LOL)  heres some more  http://pubget.com/paper/14708953/Cardiovascular_disease_resulting_from_a_diet_and_lifestyle_at_odds_with_our_Paleolithic_genome__how_to_become_a_21st_century_hunter_gatherer    If you want more information google it yourself, but I won't blame you if you choose to be ignorant because it is much easier to accept the ideas that we already believe than to change our opinions.

They are already in animal tests here in the U.S.  ---  *From their most recent newsletter (Jan 8, 2013):*    **Vasalgel Test Results in Rabbits**  All the rabbits in the first study now have Vasalgel long-acting vas deferens male contraceptive. The preliminary results are in: Four months so far, and no living sperm! It's just what we hoped for: There are some fragments (tails, etc.) in some of the samples, indicating that pressure is being let off, but none of the sperm are making it through alive. This polymer really is a remarkable substance!   The rabbits will have it in for two more months; at that point some of them will be extensively examined for safety and microscopic effects, and others will continue on for a full year. We're optimistic enough that we're planning the rest of the formal animal and laboratory studies needed before use in humans, the last step before meeting with FDA and other regulatory authorities about starting the first clinical trial (the aim is to start this year). Keep your fingers crossed!    **Get ready: Crowdfunding This Spring**  Lots of people have asked how to contribute towards making Vasalgel happen. Many people have mentioned Kickstarter - and we think crowdfunding is a good idea. In fact, we'll be counting on crowdfunding to fund the clinical trial! If you are getting this newsletter, you will be hearing as soon as it happens.   We'd love to use Kickstarter (the biggest crowdfunding platform), but it doesn't accept medical technology projects. However, the second-biggest crowdfunding site, IndieGoGo, will do medical projects and looks pretty good. It's easy to use, because you can sign in with a Facebook account and you can contribute with a credit card or PayPal.   Vasalgel is being developed as a ""social venture"" company - a hybrid form in which the aim is to be self-supporting (so it doesn't have to always be begging for money), but nobody will be making a killing. Since it's going to cost several million dollars, we'll be looking for program-related investments from foundations and low-interest loans from investors who would like to make a difference, but we'll be relying mostly on crowdfunding (here we come, IndieGoGo!). In the end, Vasalgel making it to market is going to be mostly about men (and women) and how much they want it, take action, and spread the word.    TAKE ACTION: Get signed up and ready to go on [IndieGoGo](http://www.indiegogo.com).  Follow Progress on Facebook  Now that the rabbit results are looking so promising and we're on a roll, we'll be sending out progress updates once a month or so. But would you like to hear the news right as it happens? Join Vasalgel on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Vasalgel).    Sincerely, The Vasalgel™ team",™

t5_2qh62,redditor_ent,1358917283,"No offense taken and I appreciate your response. However, I never claimed to have any understanding of how operating systems work or even how computers work. In fact, at one point I even said that I'm a frequent visitor of [/r/explainlikeimfive](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) witch was basically me acknowledging my own stupidity. Most importantly, I never meant to be derogative. I'm actually interested in Ubuntu and in no way am I trying to put it down. My understanding is-- or was, that Ubuntu was faster and lighter than XP. Witch is why I came here wondering why it wasn't running as fast as XP was.   The computer I have is actually running a copy of XP I put on it. Before that it was Vista; although, I did get it secondhand from a family member. Did I try running Windows Vista or 7 on it? No, like I said earlier I thought Ubuntu was capable of running on weak hardware. On that note; I also said in a previous post that I realize my hardware is horrible and don't expect much from it. I don't blame the OS, really, I was just under the impression it would run better than XP even on my ""outdated"" hardware.   My computer says I have 0.99GiBs or RAM? My processor is an Intel® Pentium(R) Dual CPU E2160 @ 1.80GHz × 2 . Does it have the right drivers? I have no idea to be honest; however, seeing as I got that information from System Monitor I'd say it's reading it. Does it meet the requirements? Honestly? I have no clue, I'm not much of a computer wiz as you frankly pointed out. Why don't you tell me, instead of criticize me? Not trying to be offensive, I mean I'm all for constructive criticism and stuff, but you could have possibly did it with a little less attitude.  I have no clue what there hardware is exactly, but I'm certain it was from a similar time period as my system and around the same quality.   Appropriate research? I just installed Ubuntu and it's not like I know my way around it. Also I'm not very bright so it's a lot easier for me to go to a place like this and have kind redditors direct me in what I could do or even give me certain resources and information. And if I don't know what to research (witch I really don't) how can you even tell me to put a little more effort into diagnosing the issue? Honestly, you could be a little more helpful and a little less rude.    ",®

t5_2qh1i,parkerposy,1358976872,"semi motivational poetry?  for me it has to be. really puts my place in this existence in perspective  **Desiderata**  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.  Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.   You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.   © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

I lost my job about 3 weeks ago at a salt factory in Texas, I had worked there for 10 years. I live in Canada so I was happy that I did not have to commute anymore but still I had no money. So now I am here in a group house in Canada. The people in the house are pretty nice for the most part but one person in particular is becoming a problem. There is this one girl about my age (30) and she keeps pressuring me to move out. She thinks that I will not be able to pay my bills because I have no job. She keeps threatening saying she will tell the house owner. Anyways as I was walking out of the house one day I tripped on a rock... And I scraped my knee...

The Visa Infinite and Platinum Travel Visa are similar. The only difference between the two of them is that the Visa Infinite provides free medical insurance on travel paid for with the Infinite.  The travel cards and Gold Elite card differ mainly in the reward system and car insurance options.  The Gold Elite is straight cashback at 1%.  The travel cards get points per dollar spent, the points can only be spent on travel. It's a convoluted system but it works out to 1.5% (or 4.5% for purchases made through Expedia). If you plan to buy flights / hotels / car rentals, the Visa Infinite is better.  Both classes of card have car rental insurance included. The Gold Elite includes roadside assistance insurance as well. If you own your own car and don't want to pay for a CAA membership, the Gold Elite is better. If you just want to avoid paying car rental insurance, go with the Visa Infinite.  ",®

t5_2s4m9,Anticonvulsant,1359003605,"I don't know, SRS . . . In a society which embraces true eaglelibrarianism, the obvious solution would be to place the parents' names in some sort of random number generator machine — we could call it the Custodiator 3000 or something like that — and have full custody assigned to the machine's choice. This would eliminate the impact which Feminist Organized Criminal Racket Inc. ™ has on the man-hating judges who are well known to preside over all child custody hearings.  Now some might say, ""But, what about the best interests of the children?"" They'll point out that many parents aren't interested in fighting for custody, that some parents are simply unfit to be awarded custody, and that randomized assignment of rights over children's lives would generally be a fucking disaster. I must remind them that the welfare of children clearly doesn't matter as much as equalizing statistics which were made up by some random Redditor.

When the earl of Last decides he needs an heir, he plucks his bastard son, Janus, from the slums of the city of Murne—much to the dismay of Miranda, Janus's constant companion. Determined to find Janus and kill the earl of Last, she dresses as a boy and finds her way into the household of the dissolute Baron Vornatti, an enemy of Last. Trained in all the skills of a decadent and treacherous court by the lecherous baron and his servant Gilly—and possessed by Black-Winged Ani, a bloodthirsty goddess of love and vengeance—Miranda becomes Maledicte. This complex protagonist becomes both a pawn and a power in a darkly original world of doubted gods and declining civilization. Robins is a fantasist with a future.

t5_2qi67,carrboneous,1359027204,"The Shulchan Aruch's [exact words](http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%98_%D7%94) are (all emphasis mine, obviously):  &gt; *There are those* who say that you have to make the tzitzis the same colour as the garment and *those who are very particular* do that.  The Rema follows up with: &gt; Ashkenazim have the custom to only use white tzitzis, even on coloured garments, *and you should not change from that*.  The Mishna Berura explains (apparently following the Beis Yosef) that the reason is because of ""zeh kaili v'anvahu"", ie it is a question of beautifying the mitzvah. He adds that some say it is based on the general principle of having the corner and the strings of the same material.  He also adds that it is nonetheless appropriate (or a good thing) to have either white corners or a white tallis katan, so as to satisfy all opinions (and also because of a reference in Daniel to Hashem as wearing clothes as white as snow, if I'm following. I'm not sure what the connection is though. Maybe just that that is a smart way of dressing...).  He also mentions that ""our"" tallitot having a stripe (? lip?) like techeilet is fine, because this follows the ""ikkar"" (main part? I don't think he means majority, but the primary identification. But I'm not sure) of the garment.  So even according to the Shulchan Aruch, there's no problem with wearing white strings on an entirely red garment. He would say it's a Good Thing™ to match them (and generally when halachic works qualify specific types of people who should or do take on a certain custom, the ""casual reader"" is excluded). (The Beis Yosef says this is because of *hidur mitzva*, which suggests to me that even those who hold it is a requirement -- I'm going to go out on a limb and assume the Rambam is among them -- might agree that if you did wear white-on-colour, you would still have fulfilled the *minimum* requirements, and would not be batel the aseh. But I'm not convinced that that is a legitimate inference. There could definitely be other ways to look at it).  The Rema only disagrees inasmuch as he holds that it is *not* a Good Thing™ to wear another colour but white (and holds that it is permissible to wear red strings on a red garment, but in fact *better* to wear white strings on a garment of any colour).  The Mishna Berura and others say that one should wear a white tallis so as to fulfill the best way according to both of these opinions (and so the preponderance of white tallitot follows the preference for white strings, and not the other way around), but nobody says that it is problematic to wear white strings on a coloured garment (which is a relief to me personally, because I have an army green tallis katan with white strings).  Even if you are being strict about fulfilling both opinions (white strings on white tallis), only the *ikkar* (however that is defined) must be white, not the entire garment.  Edit: I just realised that the Shulchan Aruch does not specify that white is always ok, and in fact would seem to imply that any colour tzitzis on any colour garment would be acceptable. Obviously, this isn't the ideal according to anyone, but it is interesting to note nonetheless. As far as I can tell (from this halocha alone. Please will someone correct me if I'm wrong), you could get away with blue tzitzis on a red tallis if you wanted/had to.  (As it stands: SA holds colour-on-colour is *ideal*, but doesn't require any particular colours. The Rema holds that white-on-anything is ideal (presumably colour-on-colour is next best). Later authorities suggest that white-on-white is therefore ideal according to everyone (but do not require it or forbid alternative combinations).",™

t5_2w2yu,OrangeKuchen,1359032138,"First, keep checking your mail.  I got this overnight:  *Digital River would like to express our sincere apologies for the problems that you had ordering NAMCO BANDAI's Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch™ - Wizard's Edition. Because of an error in our ordering system, the available inventory of Wizard's Edition was oversold by mistake. The good news is because you were among the very first customers to place an order when inventory was available, we still have an opportunity to fulfill your original order. Before we are able to ship your order, we just need to you to contact our customer service department at 952-392-2057 to update your payment method. When you call, please have your order number (#) available.*  I preordered in June last year.  Second, I work in a business that relies heavily on overseas manufacturing.  It could be logistically impossible to make more without a huge loss, one that NamcoBandai maybe just isn't willing to take.  For example, with all the stuff in the Wizard's edition they're obviously using multiple manufacturers.  Let's say they had 40,000 preorders.  They contacted the factories they had lined up to make drippy, and the spell book, and the wizard's coin, and the music CD, and the art cards.  (some of those may come from the same manufacturer, but Drippy and the Coin likely came from different places).  They get a quote an write up a contract for 40,000 units, and the factories give them a priced based on that number, knowing in advance how much business they're going to get.  If they were to now go back and say ""We need 2000 more of each"" there could be big issues with that.  Small runs cost exponentially more than large runs.  I think the biggest problem would be with the Drippy plush.  Fabric related manufacturers don't keep fabric on hand in all colors, they will custom dye a batch.  Sometimes the dying is outsourced to another factory, who might have minimum order quantities (yardage, not units) for them to even accept an order, it doesn't matter who's placing the order.  They may have already booked work with other clients and they can't stop production on their new large orders to make afew thousand more plushies on short notice.  If they did take a reorder, it'd be at a MUCH higher price than the initial order.  And then there's the biggest reason.  Chinese New Year.  Pretty much all manufacturing shuts down in China for the month of February due to Chinese New Year.  Each factory might not be closed that entire time, but because there are rolling shutdowns of related sources it basically knocks out the month of February for production in China.  Everyone who manufactures in China knows it's coming and factories typically book up with no room for new orders in December/January.  It's hard to even get in during March because everyone is playing catchup.  Anyways, not excusing NB/DR's treatment of this fiasco, just trying to share some insight into the manufacturing of a collection like this.",™

t5_2qh1i,z0mbiegrl,1359038944,"**Reposted, but appropriate**   When I was 15 years old, I started attending a rather prestigious christian school. Yeah, yeah, uniforms and the whole bit. I'd grown up very sheltered, thus I wasn't really used to any kind of male attention, which I got, having developed early, in great quantities. Usually, I was either embarrased, or convinced that the guy(s) were playing some kind of joke on me. I didn't believe that I was really at all attractive. Then one day I found a note in my locker. It was a plain white index card, folded over and sealed with a little foil heart sticker. Inside, it simply said ""I think you're beautiful."" in careful print. That one got to me. It was very, very different from what I was used to... Basically leering, dirty comments, or propositions. That was sweet, innocent, and touching. I wondered who sent it, but didn't really have any way of finding out. So I stuck it in one of my notebooks and began to daydream about who might be my secret admirer. Was it the cute boy who gave me a pencil in my homeroom? Maybe my lab partner, who I found utterly adorable, even though he was a few years older than I was.   I was a ditzy, moony eyed teenage girl, dreaming of puppy love and maybe my first kiss. I took the note out whenever I was sad or upset and it always made me smile, but weeks had passed and I had no idea at all who had left it, nor had I gotten another one. I began to worry that maybe it wasn't really meant for me at all. Maybe someone had just put it in the wrong locker by mistake.   I was feeling down on myself and a little silly when I opened my locker one morning and - behold! - another note. Same little white index card, folded over and sealed with the same little foil heart. Trembling with excitement and anticipation, I carefully peeled one lobe of the heart up and read the following words: ""You are so lovely."" Like any dopey kid, I held the note to my chest, sighing, with a dumb grin on my face. 2 notes? It was no accident! Someone really liked ME. WOW! I made a dumb little scrap book thing and tucked the notes inside. I also began trying again in earnest to discern the identity of my secret admirer, but with only two unsigned notes as clues, I didn't get very far. I knew that whomever left the notes had to go to my school, that was obvious... But I didn't know much else. Maybe my admirer wasn't a guy at all. Damn. I didn't like mysteries I couldn't solve.   During this time, I had been building a friendship with a classmate, we'll call him Mark. Mark was a sophmore (I was a senior) but we had AP Latin together. We shared a free period as well, and sometimes hung out in the library, as we were both avid readers. Mark wasn't exactly my type, if a 15 year old can be said to have one, but he was sweet and we had many common interests. As we spent more time together, I started thinking that the notes were from him. Then one day, he confessed to ""liking"" me, and I had my answer! Or so I thought.  Mark told me how he felt over stale fundraising donuts eaten on the back wall behind the gym. I laughed, getting powdered sugar all over my stupid vest. ""Why the big charade?"" I asked, ""Why didn't you just tell me to begin with instead of leaving me those mysterious notes?"" Mark's face fell. ""What notes? I didn't send you any notes, Z0mbiegrl."" The mystery continues... but now I had a coconspirator. (Forgive my naivette. I was 15 and didn't realize how cruel it was to use someone who had just confessed to liking me, but that I wasn't really all that keen on to help me figure out who my secret admirer was, all the while hoping it was someone I really DID like...)   Another week, another note. ""I think about you always."". Awwww. Mark was starting to exhibit some signs of jealousy, which I brushed off. After all, we didn't know who the mystery notesender was. It could be snort Riley! (The token loaner/weird kid). Time went on, and I started losing focus in class. My grades didn't slip or anything, I made up for it, but as a normally attentive student, there was a clear shift in my attention. I went from listening intently to a talk on greek mythology to being called on and gasp! not knowing the anwser because I was too busy staring off into the distance and imagining my secret admirer as some sort of Tuxedo Mask-like figure, who would someday reveal himself and give me a rose and a dashing smile.   The next note said ""You smell like love itself."" Huh. I didn't know how to take that. I smelled like a combination of L'Oreal Kids Cherry shampoo and Cotton Candy Body Fantasies™. But, if that was what love smelled like, ok! The next note said ""I want to touch you."" Ok. That's a little creepy, but maybe in a kind of sweet way, right? Mark was freaked out and said I should go to the authorities, or at least the Head Mistress. I was dead set against that. I might scare my admirer away, if not get him/her in trouble. I didn't want to do that. So I tucked the note away with the others and waited for the next one.   I spent the night at a friend's house at some point. Typical teenage stuff. We watched stupid movies, gossiped about everything, ate junk food, and played with makeup. It was a great time, though by then I had begun to realize that I fit in better with the boys (Especially the video game/tabletop playing kind) than I ever would with the girls. When I left the following morning, something caught my eye - and stopped my heart. On my friend's mailbox, shimmering innocently in the 10:00 AM light, was a foil heart. Ok, now I was officially freaked out. I ran back inside and told my friend and her mother. Both of them seemed to think I was on something or overreacting. It was, after all, February. Heart stickers were everywhere. That one might've even been there for a while and I just hadn't noticed it. I dropped it, but inside I was still afraid.   Monday morning... another note. ""I want to taste you."" OK, this wasn't cool anymore. Not at all. But I didn't know what to do. I talked about it to Mark, who convinced me to approach the school's very own Safety Officer... Who proceeded to laugh at me. ""Kid, if I went after every hormone addled guy with a crush who didn't have the balls to admit it, I'd be here forever!"" Yeah. Ok.   I stole one of my father's pocket knives and began carrying it around with me ""for protection"". (Yeah, like a dull 2"" blade is going to stop ANYONE.) I stopped going to my usual after school activities and hurred for my bus as soon as the bell rang. I always took the seat closest to the door in class, so I could see if anyone looked in, or looked suspicious as they passed by. And I found more heart stickers. It felt like they were everywhere I looked. I started having panic attacks when I saw them. On the window of my mother's car. On the table I sat at at lunch. On the door of the girls' room after I left (When it hadn't been there before).   Mark wanted me to go to the ""real cops"", but I couldn't make myself do it, not after the way Safety Guy had treated me. I didn't want to be laughed at again. It's a major issue for me, not to be taken seriously. So I did nothing. I suffered in silence. Until one day I came home and got the mail. Just like always... only this time, mixed in with the catalogs and bills was a plain white envelope sealed with one of those goddamned evil foil hearts. Inside it were pictures. Horrible pictures. Pictures of a grown man in various states of undress, doing things to himself. And a note. ""I bet your blood tastes like chocolate.""   I started screaming, which got my mother's attention. She called the police, who came out to the house and took a report. Luckily, I recognized the man in the photos, and they were more than enough evidence to arrest the slimeball. He was the school janitor.  **Yes, I was a senior at 15. I skipped a few grades.** ",™

While double-blind is considered the gold standard for trials where new treatments or drugs or therapies are introduced, a serious researcher could, and does, dream of conducting studies otherwise. In fact, the primary reason for double-blind is to remove bias. In all honesty, double-blind is not a general standard for experimentation and in nearly all cases, not needed. It's only if the introduction of bias could have a very serious negative impact on subjects.  Given that, are you trying to describe [triple-blind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment#Triple-blind_trials)? Also, in a number of cases, giving a ""treatment"" and telling people it's a placebo would be unethical. One of the major reasons for these types of studies is to find out not just if something works, but also to find the side-effects. If you lie to someone and say ""here's a placebo"" and give them a new drug -- you have introduced a bias. People may feel comfortable with ""not getting treatment"" and might not tell you some key medical history.  ",™

You may unsubscribe if you no longer wish to receive our emails.   Website |  About TAC  |  Contact  |  Calendar  | Join TAC  |  Blog  |   Donate  |  Like us on Facebook  |  Twitter Dear XXXXX,  I was shocked when I heard how Texas A&amp;M ""honored"" MLK with a speech by actor and political activist Danny Glover.  Instead of honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King and promoting true equality, these are the messages Texas A&amp;M promoted for Martin Luther King Day 2013: The 2nd Amendment was for killing Native Americans and slaves. America is still a racist society. Occupy Wall Street was creative and praiseworthy. The Constitution is obsolete. A&amp;amp;M will continue racial preferences in hiring and admissions. Martin Luther King would be fighting global warming today. Texas A&amp;M administrators reaffirmed their commitment to the far-left agenda by funding Danny Glover to speak on campus for the sixth annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Breakfast.  If Dr. Loftin and his administrators want to live up to their claim that Texas A&amp;M is a 'marketplace of ideas' and achieve true diversity, it is time for funding balance and viewpoint neutrality on campus.  The university harms students when only one worldview is funded, promoted, and communicated by the administration.  Click here to sign the petition against liberal bias at Texas A&amp;M if you are tired of your money being spent on speakers, programs, and events that are almost exclusively liberal.  Please also forward this email to as many Aggies as you can.  Perhaps the most shocking part of the MLK Breakfast was when Glover said ""the Second Amendment comes from the right to protect themselves from slave revolts, and from uprisings by Native Americans.""  That's not the accurate historical perspective one would expect at a tier-one research university.  Click below to watch the remarks from Danny Glover, who Texas A&amp;M President Bowen Loftin said would be ""imparting great wisdom to us.""  Danny Glover at TexasA&amp;M MLK Breakfast, 2nd Amendment    At a press conference in Austin yesterday, Texas A&amp;amp;M University System Chancellor John Sharp commented on Glover's speech:  ""I haven't met the Aggie yet that agrees with Mr. Glover.  But I've met every Aggie that agrees that he should be able to have the right, uniquely American, to say anything he wants to say about any subject.""  The Aggie Conservatives agree with Chancellor Sharp's statement.  Every student and every student organization should have their 1st Amendment rights retained on campus, including the rights to host invited speakers or speak freely on campus.  But that doesn't mean that Texas A&amp;M administrators should use student fee money, tuition, donations, and tax dollars to fund only liberal speakers, as they have a track record of doing.  The total cost of the Danny Glover MLK Breakfast exceeded $40,000, including the $27,000 speaking fee for Mr. Glover.  Funding for the event came from over a dozen university departments: Aggie Athletic Department: $1,000 Association of Former Students: $3,000 Office of President Bowen Loftin: $2,000 Office of Provost Karan Watson: $750 Africana Studies Program: $1,000 Office of Undergraduate Studies: $750 And the list goes on... The Texas A&amp;M administration's history of preferencing the political left goes back much further than last week.  Two years ago, Texas A&amp;M spent over $10,000 of your student fees to bring a radical, violent, unrepentant communist and terrorist to speak on campus: Angela Davis. In addition, many Texas A&amp;M departments sponsored the event, including $2,000 from the Office of the President, $1,000 from the Athletics Department, and over $6,000 from other university departments.  Over $25,000 was spent last year to bring anti-American activist Harry Belefonte to campus. Sponsors of this event included the Office of the President, the Athletic Department, and many others.  Before this fall, conservative and Christian student organizations were not eligible for student organization funding through Student Activities.  Fortunately, the Aggie Conservatives settled a lawsuit with the Texas A&amp;amp;M administration in November to correct this previous funding bias.  The Department of Multicultural Services funnels just under $1,000,000 of mandatory student fees each year to liberal programs, speakers, and student organizations, including $1,000 to Danny Glover's speech.  It's time for the Department of Multicultural Services to promote true multicultural  programming, including that which celebrates traditional family values, traditional American culture, and Texas's rich history.  The Department of Residence Life, along with the Residence Hall Association, is liberal in orientation, promoting the acceptance and approval of homosexuality, including holding programs such as ""Guess Who's Gay"" and ""Sex in the Dark.""  Resident Life contributed $500 to Glover's speech.  The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered (GLBT) Center spends over $60,000 in mandatory student service fee money each year in order to promote a perverse, one-sided sexual worldview.  The GLBT Center uses your student fee money to host speakers such as the ""openly bi, openly progressive, openly feminist"" activist Zoe Nicholson and to hold programs such as the pornographic ""Fun and Safe Sex Seminar,"" at which students were taught different ways to have anal and oral sex (complete with student demonstrations).   Meanwhile, conservatives receive no student fee money, and those who believe in true love, chastity, and marriage are ridiculed and harassed.  In 2011, university departments teamed up with the GLBT to host GLBT journalist and activist Neil Miller.  The $6,000 event was sponsored by the Office of the President, Residence Life, several academic departments, and many other administrative departments.  Four prominent professors at A&amp;amp;M, including the keynote speaker of the 2008 freshman convocation, signed an online petition in support of Bill Ayers, the unrepentant far-left Weather Underground terrorist and associate of Obama.  According to Federal Election Commission data, 85% of A&amp;amp;M employees who donated to a presidential campaign in 2008 contributed to a Democratic candidate.    While 46% of undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;amp;M identify as ""conservative,"" only 26% of Texas A&amp;amp;M graduate students identify as ""conservative.""  That's not the conservative majority that you might have thought existed on campus.  A recent study by the National Association of Scholars (NAS) found that the Texas A&amp;amp;M History Department gave ""strong emphasis to race, class, and gender social history, an emphasis so strong that it diminished the attention given to other subjects in American history (such as military, diplomatic, religious, intellectual history). The result is that the institution frequently offered students a less-than-comprehensive picture of U.S. history.""  The NAS reported that ""Texas A&amp;amp;M has reached a dangerous tipping point in how students will be taught American history.""  The History Department contributed to Danny Glover, Harry Belafonte, and Angela Davis; however, they refused to help fund a conservative speaker last year.    Dr. Loftin is set on achieving predetermined race demographics at Texas A&amp;amp;M, as he mentioned during the intro to Glover's speech.  Instead of looking at each individual and evaluating his or her unique merits, the university administration wants to implement additional racial preferencing programs until the student body and faculty match the administration's desired racial demographic spreadsheet.    The trend to the left at Texas A&amp;amp;M is disastrous:  Many of the administrators and faculty are liberal. Their worldview shapes what they teach and do. Thus many of the courses, textbooks, handouts, assignments, class lectures, campus speakers, university programs, initiatives, and policies, etc. lean to the left. Thus the university heavily funds liberal institutions, student groups, programs, and initiatives on campus while their conservative counterparts get little to nothing, if they exist at all. Texas A&amp;amp;M University spends millions of dollars each year in mandatory student fees, taxpayer dollars, and private donations to continually represent left-wing views.  A&amp;amp;M should have diversity of thought in its faculty, viewpoint neutral funding of speakers and events, and politically balanced course offerings.  It is high time for A&amp;amp;M to stop pushing a political agenda.  The Texas A&amp;amp;M administration is much more liberal than you ever guessed or imagined. And the political climate will only get worse unless you and I stand up for fairness and true diversity!  XXXXX, please join me in signing the petition against liberal bias at Texas A&amp;amp;M.

QUESTION:  Why does ArmaLite object to other companies calling their rifles “AR-10.”   ANSWER:  First, we object because they aren’t AR-10®s.  The AR-10 is a special rifle manufactured by ArmaLite.  Second, the model term “AR-10® is a registered ArmaLite trademark and may be used only on ArmaLite rifles or rifles made under license.  ArmaLite spent a lot of money producing the AR-10 when no one else would.  We have spent a lot of time building the name and reputation of this rifle and trademark law requires us to prevent others from infringing on the trademark.   In addition, assuring that our model designation is properly used only with our rifle reduces the likelihood of owners of  problematic lower-grade semiautomatic 308  rifles from referring to their problems as “AR-10 problems”.

t5_2sqqn,The_Maester,1359068111,"In anticipation of the upcoming Revolution DLC Map Pack for Call of Duty®: Black Ops II, sat down with Combat Designer Anthony Flame and Lead Artist Murad Ainuddin from Treyarch Studios to discuss the bonus Peacekeeper SMG.  Weapon Choice  There’s a lot of excitement around the Peacekeeper SMG, as it’s the first time Call of Duty has ever offered a bonus weapon with DLC. Why did you go with an SMG?  Anthony:  First we began thinking, what will get the most people excited – what is something that people haven’t seen before? The conversation quickly gravitated to the fact that our two most popular weapon classes are SMGs and assault rifles, so we thought it would be cool to create a hybrid of those. Having a weapon in DLC is new, having this type of weapon is new and it speaks to the choices that players make – we loved the idea.  Design Inspiration  The Peacekeeper is an original design by Treyarch. What inspiration did the art team take for the weapon’s look?  Murad:  Based on Anthony’s direction of creating a hybrid assault rife and SMG, we designed the Peacekeeper to have a compact rifle look. We also wanted to give a base white finish to provide a stark contrast from all the other weapons in Black Ops II, but also in Call of Duty history. We chose a lot of synthetic polymers and lightweight materials to make up the surface look to represent that near-future “hotness.” We want players to feel like this is a familiar weapon, but one they’ve never seen before.  We typically start out with some side profiles, not worrying about detail – getting the big ideas down first. After the profile is approved, that's when we internally start breaking up components inside the silhouette.  Balancing  How does balance factor into the Peacekeeper to ensure that it falls in line in terms of stats with other weapons?  Anthony:  The Peacekeeper is a Submachine Gun-Assault Rifle Hybrid. It has the lightweight design of an SMG, but with better range and accuracy at the cost of close quarters firepower. It's a great weapon for objective modes like Hardpoint, where you need to quickly get into position and cover objectives from a safe distance.  Backstory  Is there any kind of backstory to the Peacekeeper? How does it fit into the lore you’ve created for Black Ops II?  Murad:  The idea is, this is the weapon that is issued to special ops forces of the future to deal with counter-terrorist threats and for VIP protection. It reaches out far, yet compact enough for concealment, and easy to carry and operate in vehicles.  Diamond Camo  For our Diamond Camo fanatics, how will the Peacekeeper affect SMG Challenge progress?  Anthony:  The Peacekeeper does not affect diamond progression for the 6 core submachine guns - they will function exactly as before. If you earn Diamond Camo on the core 6 SMG's, when you earn gold for the Peacekeeper you will then get Diamond for it as well.   Impressions  Any last words from the team in regard to its use?  Anthony:  We're very excited for the opportunity to give players a DLC weapon for the first time in a Call of Duty game. This has allowed us to evaluate how the fans are playing the game, and offer new content that improves the online experience. For the Peacekeeper, we wanted to give players a high mobility weapon that wasn't just meant for close quarters, which will open up more medium and long range firefights. Internally, the team has been having a blast with the Peacekeeper on the new maps. We look forward to the community getting their hands on the Peacekeeper, and seeing how this affects the meta game of Pick 10 selection.  That concludes the interview. We'd like to thank Anthony Flame, Murad Ainuddin, Will Huang, Mark Manto and the rest of the design and development team at Treyarch for their work on the Peacekeeper and taking the time to walk us through its creation.",®

t5_2sm9e,monximus,1359070250,"&gt;Also, what about baby mama drama?  Lifetime movies:  **Bling Ring** &gt;Inspired by a true story, The Bling Ring centers around Zack (Austin Butler, Switched at Birth), a shy, awkward middle-class boy searching to be accepted by his high school classmates. When he meets Natalie (Yin Chang, Gossip Girl), a seemingly nice girl but in actuality a bit more nefarious than one would think, the promise of popularity and friendship soon becomes a reality when they begin 'shopping' in the closets of the rich and famous. Empowered by the thrill of not getting caught and under the impression the stolen goods will make them popular, Zack, Natalie and a few other friends begin breaking into the homes of a number of major celebrities, robbing them of millions of dollars in clothes, shoes and jewelry. As their crimes begin to attract the attention of the media, the group succeeds in becoming the envy of their peers. Meanwhile, Zack's mother, Iris (**Jennifer Grey, Dirty Dancing**), happy to see that her son has finally made friends, is blissfully unaware of his crime spree until it begins to attract the wrong kind of attention.  **Capture of the Green River Killer** &gt;For nearly 20 years, the Green River Killer haunted Washington State with a series of shocking murders. Told through the eyes of a young runaway, the Lifetime Movie Network miniseries THE CAPTURE OF THE GREEN RIVER KILLER details how fate, bad luck and unwise choices led to Helen Hel Remus (Amy Davidson, 8 Simple Rules) encounter with the notorious serial killer. Leading the hunt for the murderer is Sheriff David Reichert (Tom Cavanagh, Ed), who becomes so entangled in the case that he's willing to risk his family and career to find justice for the slain girls. Surprisingly, it's a meeting with convicted serial killer Ted Bundy (James Marsters, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) that may help Reichert finally find his man, but bringing him to justice will be anything but easy.  **Client List** &gt;**Jennifer Love Hewitt** stars in her sexiest role ever as Samantha Horton, a former Texas Homecoming Queen who always relied on her beauty and charm to navigate life, something her beautician mother Cassie (Golden Globe award winner **Cybill Shepherd**) taught her. But when the Horton family finds itself facing financial ruin, Samantha must take a job at a local massage parlor, only to discover it's a front for a high-end call girl operation - one so lucrative, she can't afford to turn it down. But when the parlor is raided, Samantha must either cooperate with police and give up her clients' identities, or lose everything she tried so hard to save. Also starring Golden Globe (R) award winner Cybill Shepherd, The Client List is an unforgettable descent into sex, seduction and a scandal that would change the lives of one small Texas town forever.   **Craigslist Killer** &gt;Seemingly flawless medical student Philip Markoff leads a double life and starts to descend into a twisted world of gambling, crime, battery and eventually murder, all while meeting his victims through Craigslist.   **Drew Peterson: Untouchable** &gt;Based on a true story, this film follows the fascinating tale of police officer Drew Peterson's (played by **Rob Lowe**) fall from grace after the mysterious disappearance of his fourth wife.    **Girl Fight** &gt;Based on a true story, Girl Fight, starring Emmy-winning actress **Anne Heche** and James Tupper (Men In Trees), tells the harrowing tale of Haley, a studious and responsible young woman who desperately wanted to be part of her school's ""in"" crowd. After some of Haley's new ""friends"" discover negative remarks she made about them on social media sites, the girls take revenge by viciously beating Haley, then boasting about the event online. Instead of showing remorse, the girls post a shocking video of the beating on the Internet, sending Haley's life into a downward spiral, with profound damage made to her self-esteem and social well-being.  **Maneater** &gt;Beautiful, fashionable and fun, Clarissa Alpert is a shallow socialite whose speed dial is a veritable Rolodex of Hollywood power players. Staring her 32nd birthday directly in the eyes - though she will admit only to being 28 - the spoiled daddy’s girl is in a panic because she is still single. Clarissa, though, always gets what she wants - even if he’s Aaron Mason (Philip Winchester), the hottest new producer in town. With the help of her family and friends, Clarissa sets into motion an elaborate plan to lasso the dashing filmmaker who will, she hopes, be the man to put a ring on her finger.  **Natalee Holloway** &gt;During a 2005 high school class trip to Aruba, a carefree night out with friends turns tragic when teenager Natalee Holloway fails to show up for her return flight home to Alabama. When Natalee disappears without a trace, her celebratory island vacation becomes a harrowing nightmare for her family. And with no clue as to her whereabouts, her mother, Beth Twitty (Tracy Pollan), is launched into a frustrating search that spans more than four years. Along with her husband George (Grant Show) and her best friend Carol (Catherine Dent), Beth struggles to uncover the truth. As a trio of suspects are arrested and then released because of a lack of evidence, Beth's quest for justice provides the backdrop for a cautionary tale about the dangers of international travel. Based on the book by Beth Holloway-Twitty.  **Who is Clark Rockefeller**  &gt;The Rockefeller tale begins with German con artist Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter (McCormack) coming to the U.S. in 1979 as a foreign exchange student. He used a series of aliases, impersonating a talk show host and a Pentagon adviser, among others. Gerhartsreiter soon became a fixture in Boston high society for more than a decade after he claimed to be Clark Rockefeller, an heir to the famous dynasty. The deception was described as ""the longest con in FBI history."" He eventually married Sandra Boss, a millionaire with a Harvard MBA and a partner at the prestigious business consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. After losing custody of their daughter during the divorce, Rockefeller kidnapped the girl during a supervised visit in July 2008. The abduction and Rockefeller's apprehension after the safe retrieval of his daughter drew nationwide attention and led to the discovery of his real identity. At a trial this spring, Gerhartsreiter was sentenced to four to five years in prison for the kidnapping.   **Wisegal** &gt;Loyal to the Family. Devoted to her own. **Alyssa Milano** stars as Patty Montanari, a tough Brooklyn widow and mother who takes a job working for a local crime family and soon becomes romantically involved with a married mob captain (Jason Gedrick of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES). But as Patty rises in the organization’s ranks, she finds herself sinking deeper into an underworld of paranoia, betrayal and murder. Caught between the Feds, the Family and the man she loves, can she pull the trigger on the decision that may cost her everything?

t5_2s7tt,uselessstolencomment,1359084065,"Think of it like a waterslide:  Waterslides are 100-200 metres long and twist and turn a lot. Additionally, most waterslides are part of larger setups that include 3-4 waterslides of similar length. So in essence, a lifeguard watching a waterslide must patrol up to 800 metres of slide. That’s more than most police officers have to deal with.  Now imagine that everyone says to themselves, “Fuck the lifeguards. We’re rational and intelligent people, and we know how to stay safe. We can go down fucking waterslides by ourselves.” They grab him by the genitals and toss him off the platform, snapping his spine in two and cracking his skull like a poorly made bowling pin.  (Just for context, let’s say this is all happening at Waterworld™ in Racine, Wisconsin. My cousin Lenny worked there one summer and said that it made him lose his faith in humanity. Then again Lenny’s kind of a head case so I don’t know if he should talk. One time he got super drunk and thought it would be funny to see how fast his car could go in reverse. He drove straight into an elm tree which fell on top of his neighbor’s—who happens to be Kobe Bryant—house. Kobe was mostly cool about it, but his wife got really pissed and Lenny had to shell out $500 to get some immigrant to come fix it—his words, not mine.)  Now that the people control the waterslide, they delegate two task forces: 1-Alpha, in charge of general maintenance and 2-Alpha, who take care of more technical issues. But this is a classic example of the Prisoner’s Dilemma: 1-Alpha will always insist that something is technical and outside their realm of knowledge, while 2-Alpha says that everything is simple and beneath them. To solve this problem, they form a third task force, 2-Beta, which is headed by Christopher Walken, who is visiting Waterworld with his two children.  As you might expect, Walken shakes things up. He hires an assassin to take out the leaders of 1- and 2-Alpha, and then instates his own stooges as their leaders. The people, concerned about the death of their liberties, hold a council meeting to try to find a peaceful solution. But it’s broken up by armed guards, and a lot of people are trampled to death or shot.  I wish I could explain it better but I’m not a professor, and quite honestly I don’t think I’ll ever be one because I think they’re gross. One of my high school friends is a professor now and all he ever does is pick his butthole and write absurdist literature. Someday I will go visit him but I need to save up money. I lost most of my savings in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and need to earn it back ASAP. Where would you suggest that I find work? I tried Dunkin’ Donuts but I don’t want to support them because they recognize gay rights.  Hope this helps. ",™

You can connect to Blue Link using your smartphone with the downloadable new Blue Link Mobile App, a web application or the in-car system. With the simple push of a button you can receive all the benefits this innovative technology offers.  More http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/car-news/102649/hyundai-announces-blue-link-pricing.jsp  &gt; Assurance is Blue Link's least-expensive package at just $79 a year or $198 for a three-year subscription. The subscription price includes immediate assistance in case of an accident, and an SOS button that calls emergency operators or roadside assistance. Vehicle owners can also access a monthly report of vehicle systems through Blue Link's website.  So basically, you get the roadside assistance for $80/year which is pretty much spot-on as it's been.   &gt; Next up is the Essentials package, available annually for $179, or $448 for a three-year subscription. Essentials includes everything in Assurance, plus remote door locking and unlocking through a toll-free phone number or mobile phone app, voice text messaging, a maintenance alert system letting drivers know when services are due and ""Location Sharing"" which gives drivers the ability to share the vehicle's location to friends and family through selected social networking sites. The package also includes ""Valet Alert,"" which warns customers if a valet drives beyond a prescribed area ? a feature that surely would've helped Ferris Bueller.  That requires data connection.  &gt; Blue Link's most expensive package, Guidance, is named for its navigation service. Starting at $279 annually or $699 for three years, Guidance includes everything in the other two packages plus turn-by-turn navigation including point-of-interest searches and even a function that locates nearby gas stations with the lowest fuel prices.  One more research finding http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/06/hyundai-blue-link-satellite-system-does-more-at-half-the-price-of-onstar/  -- tl;dr, its pretty much half the price of OnStar.  If none of you have ever used OnStar, I can see why you think it's a waste.  But OnStar is more than just a data connection. It's an on-demand service that you press a button and talk to someone in the US, 24/7, who is able to push directions and info to your car by just asking him/her.   From what I'm reading on Hyundai's website, you can connect the system to your mobile device for a connection. I'm sure you will have access to a few things, but you're really paying for the navigation (that stuff is actually costly for map licensing) and human services and data. Everything else is accessible.  ",®

t5_2snuc,MaybeNotANumber,1359093805,"&gt;I don't agree that your conclusion, E↔P↔D, shows that it is impossible for E to be otherwise.  It isn't merely that relation which shows it, I explained that given there only exists one actual world(B-2),  given god as necessary and seeing as P corresponds to D, then every truth P corresponds to the actual world D.  &gt;For instance, he could exist in every possible world but have different knowledge in each world.  That directly contradicts E↔P↔D seeing as D is the actual world, P can't differ from D it's an equivalence. In other words, since **God's knowledge E** corresponds to **D the actual world**, and also corresponds to **P every truth**, then every truth is equivalent to the truth in the actual world(P↔D). God is necessary, so in every possible world this condition stands that any truth must be equivalent to the actual world truth. The actual world is only one world(B-2), we can easily now conclude there is no possible world but that one which can be truth. This makes the actual world necessary because no other possible world can be true.  &gt;(Indeed, he must have different knowledge in each world to account for the propositions which have different truth-values in certain worlds.)  We've already discussed that part, his knowledge corresponds to the actual world. Any possible world which isn't the actual world will obviously clash with god's knowledge, this can't happen.  Unless you are willing to retract that you agree with the premise that god's knowledge corresponds to actuality, then what you proposed there*(God having different knowledge in different possible worlds)* is impossible.",↔

If you wanted to start a business selling waffles, this is what you would buy. This monster can churn out 8 waffles in a mere 30 seconds. It's capable of adjusting baking time and texture of *each individual square* of each waffle. It can also recognize whether you're making belgian or potato waffles and adjust itself accordingly with it's patented Truwaffle© technology. While you're waiting for your waffles to be done, which will feel longer than a microwave minute, in this case a waffle half minute, the Wafflelaffle 9000 plays one of a variety of jingles and chimes that'd make the classiest elevator music sound like a children's rhyme. You know you're getting what you paid for when a compartment on the lid opens up and a pop-out LCD screen reveals itself, ready to dish out recipe suggestions and topping recommendations. There's a Wifi-capable version where you can sign up for Netflix and Hulu Plus, but that's just ridiculous if you ask me. Be wary of any guests you have over who are Apple or iPhone aficionados, as they will confuse your new waffle iron for an iPhone 6 because of it's sleek, glossy finish and sexy curves, 100% they will try to make a phone call on it unless you somehow convince them it's not an iPhone but the Wafflelaffle 9000. Personally, I have 3 more payments on mine but it's paying for itself with the strict waffle diet I've got myself on.

It's ridiculous how you know you could be doing so much better if you had just a tiny financial cushion, and you wake up every morning exhausted and schlepp yourself to school and you see so many other kids that are so much younger than you and they're all jolly and talking about what they're going to do for vacation and blah blah.

t5_2r6rj,GoodTimesDadIsland,1359102392,"Na.  ''Scene,'' in this context, generally refers to the ''independent rock music scene'' that existed in the early 2000s.  Like most music scenes, the OG scenesters all started going to college, growing up and evolving their tastes; They split up into two main groups:   Group 1 evolved into what some today might call ''the hipster.'' The look/music became too mainstream and they had to move on to cooler things.   Group 2 strayed from this indie/artsy direction and started moving towards more of a ''Jersey Shore'' direction, favoring the club to the garage and electro to metalcore but still carrying over core staples from their scene days like the haircuts and white belts. (Also see: *Skrillex*)   This great schism occurred somewhere around 2003, shortly after groups like *Thursday* and *Coheed and Cambria* released their second albums. Most of the bands from this time were gaining too large of followings, signing to larger labels and playing the local *House of Blues* by this point, a big no-no for our proto-hipsters.  Anyways, the group of gentlemen in this video are simply a result of all of this; It went from boys wearing girl's pants at VFW halls (literally, they didn't make skinny jeans for men back then) to Target™ brand skinny jeans for men and Dubstep.   **tl;dr:** This isn't ''scene music,'' just some ex-scenesters going through a zany identity crisis.",™
t5_2snuc,gregregregreg,1359103128,"&gt;Any possible world which isn't the actual world will obviously clash with god's knowledge  As I said, if another world were to be actual, God would know the truths of that world and not ours.  &gt;Unless you are willing to retract that you agree with the premise that god's knowledge corresponds to actuality, then what you proposed there(God having different knowledge in different possible worlds) is impossible.  Another world being actual would entail that different knowledge corresponds to actuality, so it's not impossible for God to have different knowledge in some other possible world.  ___  The argument regarding D and P is peculiar, because there is no difference whatever between the definitions of D and P, which I'll restate here:  * D -- every truthful proposition in actuality  * P -- every truthful proposition  'Every truthful proposition' has the exact same meaning as 'every truthful proposition in actuality', and no argument is even required to establish this. Since D and P have the same definition, we can simplify your conclusion to E↔P. You then say,  &gt;God is necessary, so in every possible world this condition stands that any truth must be equivalent to the actual world truth.  No, it only follows that every truth *is* equivalent to the truths of the actual world—they don't *have* to be. You're sneaking in terms like 'must', and it invalidates the argument because you hadn't previously mentioned anything about what the truths 'must' be. You were merely discussing what the truths *are*, not what they have to be. Here is the leap you made:  &gt;every truth **is** equivalent to the truth in the actual world  &gt;in every possible world this condition stands that any truth **must be** equivalent to the actual world truth.  There is a significant distinction to be made here. It's one thing to say I went to sleep early last night, and another to say I *had* to go to sleep early. The former describes only actuality, and the latter uses a modal term to explain what was necessarily the case.  So you have not bridged the gap from *is* to *must be*.  &gt;This makes the actual world necessary because no other possible world can be true.  From your argument the most you could say is that no other possible world *is* true. You have not deduced that it is impossible for another world to be true.",↔

t5_2r9po,Iogic,1359119370,"I'd recommend a greatsword &amp; rifle for the most part. Greatsword for going toe-to-toe with enemies, and a rifle for the situations where that won't do (usually champions).  You'll do your most damage by using signets for all skills (at least up until level 60 or so) and investing your first 10 trait points in the Arms line, because then you can get Deep Strikes, which gives you +40 precision for every unused signet you have.   So with five signets, plus the +100 precision from the traits, you'll have +300 precision overall at just level 30 and you'll have a very high critical chance. With your greatsword's Hundred Blades skill you've got a massive damage output.   Now, I say up to around level 60 - around that time (or before) you'll notice that mobs are doing a lot of condition damage to you and Signet of Stamina's cooldown is just too long.   At that point, I'd say re-do your traits so you can get Quick Breathing from the Tactics line, and get yourself a warhorn (sword/mace/axe is entirely up to you). This gives you two skills that not only remove a condition each, but convert them into a boon, and they're both on 16 second cooldowns. Not only that, but it does the exact same to other players around you. Now you've gone from Just Another Greatsword Warrior™ to being everyone's bestest friend!   Many warrior builds are built around Shouts, and that's for one reason only - Healing Shouts. It's a great source of heals (not just for you, but those around you too) and if you get into a rhythm you can use For Great Justice, Signet of Rage and Warhorn 4 to give yourself permanent Might, Fury and Swiftness.",™

The ship is so big, that you cannot leave it to jump into another ship, Once you're in that ship, you cannot leave it.  It cannot dock(Garage), and therefor cannot be 'safe' from being killed  To obtain a Titan (the type of ship) you need ALOT of ingame currency... 100billion to have it fitted with gear correctly.  To gain 100,000,000,000.00 ISK would take one person far to long to aquire, this is why Titans are only really used by Alliances/Corporation (Guilds) and the money is obtained by the group to use for their advantage.  The advantage of having a Titan is 2 primary reasons.  1) Jump Bridge: This allows anyone nearby the titan to jump from one place to another, doing this gives the element of surprise to your enemy  2) Doomsday: Just like the name this thing is crazy, it is the single most effective damage in the game dealing ALOT of damage to a single target..   ---------  Some other things to know about Titans  You need like 8 Titan Doomsdays to kill another Titan  Before the Doomsdaynerf™ the damage used to be AoE (Area of Effect) By the click of a button, the Titan Pilot could kill any ships below Battleship who was in the area (listing the sizes below)  Titan  Mothership  Carrier  Dreadnaught  Battleship  Battlecruiser  Cruiser  Destroyer  Frigate  Titans are temporarily kept safe by being in a POS (Player owned Structure) this gives a forcefield around the Titan which also gives a warning when it's getting shot  I'm missing alot of other neat stuff but I havn't played in about a year so I'm not up to date",™

I've always been wary of returning to pre-Vatican II worship, for several reasons:  1. It sort of obviates the whole reason for Vatican II's liturgical reform, which was to bring the Church out of its stagnant Renaissance-era worship. Contrary to what some people say, Trent was not intended to be the only ecumenical council of the Church for 400 years.   2. A lot of is blatant pandering to our right-wing traditionalists. John Paul II tried to dialogue with them, and eventually he realized that there's no point in dialoguing with people who will never compromise, who think Vatican II was an illegitimate council riddled with heretical modernism. Benedict, God love him, has tried again and again to reconcile with the likes of the SSPX, and I think his instructions on the Latin Mass were a big part of that. They will never be satisfied until the Church repudiates Vatican II (which is *never* going to happen) and while I hope and pray they return to the Church, we've met them more than halfway, and they give nothing in return.   3. In effect, it helps reinforce a division which has been growing in the Church since the 1990s, between the self-appointed RealCatholics™ and the rest of us. I'm sure Benedict XVI did not really anticipate this but, well, that's a story for another day.   And hey, don't be sorry! :) It's in the past. Catholics and Protestants both treated one another terribly, and we all bear the scars of this. Our job is to move forward from this. ",™

I got this overnight:  &gt;*Digital River would like to express our sincere apologies for the problems that you had ordering NAMCO BANDAI's Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch™ - Wizard's Edition. Because of an error in our ordering system, the available inventory of Wizard's Edition was oversold by mistake. The good news is because you were among the very first customers to place an order when inventory was available, we still have an opportunity to fulfill your original order. Before we are able to ship your order, we just need to you to contact our customer service department at 952-392-2057 to update your payment method. When you call, please have your order number (#) available.*  &gt;I preordered in June last year.  &gt;Second, I work in a business that relies heavily on overseas manufacturing. It could be logistically impossible to make more without a huge loss, one that NamcoBandai maybe just isn't willing to take. For example, with all the stuff in the Wizard's edition they're obviously using multiple manufacturers. Let's say they had 40,000 preorders. They contacted the factories they had lined up to make drippy, and the spell book, and the wizard's coin, and the music CD, and the art cards. (some of those may come from the same manufacturer, but Drippy and the Coin likely came from different places). They get a quote an write up a contract for 40,000 units, and the factories give them a priced based on that number, knowing in advance how much business they're going to get.  &gt;If they were to now go back and say ""We need 2000 more of each"" there could be big issues with that. Small runs cost exponentially more than large runs. I think the biggest problem would be with the Drippy plush. Fabric related manufacturers don't keep fabric on hand in all colors, they will custom dye a batch. Sometimes the dying is outsourced to another factory, who might have minimum order quantities (yardage, not units) for them to even accept an order, it doesn't matter who's placing the order. They may have already booked work with other clients and they can't stop production on their new large orders to make afew thousand more plushies on short notice. If they did take a reorder, it'd be at a MUCH higher price than the initial order.  &gt;And then there's the biggest reason. Chinese New Year. Pretty much all manufacturing shuts down in China for the month of February due to Chinese New Year. Each factory might not be closed that entire time, but because there are rolling shutdowns of related sources it basically knocks out the month of February for production in China. Everyone who manufactures in China knows it's coming and factories typically book up with no room for new orders in December/January. It's hard to even get in during March because everyone is playing catchup.  &gt;Anyways, not excusing NB/DR's treatment of this fiasco, just trying to share some insight into the manufacturing of a collection like this.

t5_2qh5b,saijanai,1359169975,"&gt;&gt;I hadn't heard of ""brain integration scale""--that's fascinating. Do you have any more information or sources on that?  .  &gt;We have generated a Brain Integration Scale from EEG recorded during challenging computer tasks in 17 long-term Transcendental Meditation practitioners, who reported the permanent integration of “consciousness-itself,” or Transcendental Consciousness, with waking, sleeping and dreaming. This is the first of three stabilized states of enlightenment detailed in the Vedic tradition. Their brainwaves were compared to 17 age-matched meditating and 17 non-meditating subjects. Higher scores on the Brain Integration Scale were associated with 1) the state of enlightenment, 2) higher frontal 6-45 Hz EEG coherence, 3) higher alpha and lower gamma activity, 4) better match between brain preparation and task demands, 5) positive correlation (.4 to .7) with emotional stability, inner orientation, moral reasoning, and openness to experience—a trait positively correlated with ego stage (McCrae and Cost, 1980), and 6) negative correlation with anxiety (.45).  &gt;Nineteen randomly assigned American University, who practiced the TM technique for three months significantly increased on the Brain Integration Scale, while Brain Integration Scale scores for the delayed start group decreased. Thirty-three Norwegian athletes, who had won gold medals in the Olympics or World games, had significantly higher Brain Integration Scale scores than 33 comparison athletes, who did not finish in the top ten. We are scoring the SCT protocols from the 17 enlightened subjects and the 66 athletes. These data will be reported at the symposium as a basis for exploring the synergy of these two measures for delineating post-conventional stages.  Here's the formal studies on the [psychology](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/eeg-of-enlightenment.pdf) and [physiology](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/brain-integration-progress-report.pdf) of enlightened vs not-so-enlightened people, as well as how [world-champion vs world-class athletes ](http://tm-vedischewissenschaft.de/haru2009h1.pdf) and [award-winning vs average managers](http://raamglobalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Mind-brain-development-in-Successful-Leaders.pdf) compare on those same measures.  .  &gt;I think I understand what you're getting at, with making the distinction between TM and other meditation, but I have doubts that TM is the only/most efficient way. I I'm leery of the claims that TM makes regarding mantras that are specific to each individual.  The TM organization, in the 39 years that I have been practicing, has never claimed that they use 6 billion different mantras or something. All they have ever claimed is that some mantras are better than others for specific people (never use om as a mantra for TM unless you are a recluse living in a cave or begging on the street because tradition holds that the side effect of using OM is to encourage the lifestyle of a monk, while the side-effect of using the specific mantras used for TM is supposed to be beneficial to specific people) and that the TM teacher uses a simple, mechanical process to select the most appropriate mantra from a small set that he or she knows. Note: the TM organization has never claimed they have any proof that one mantra is better or worse than another,  only that this claim is from a tradition that dates back a few thousand years.  Sometimes this whole spiel is shortened to ""mantras are chosen specifically for the individual"" which eventually gets retransmitted as ""unique to each individual"" but I have never heard it claimed that everyone gets a different mantra -quite the contrary: the teacher choses from a limited set based on the information given on the application form using a simple, mechanical selection-process.  Here's a classic [Q and A session](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRSvW9Ml9DQ&amp;feature=player_embedded) from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the process of learning TM and why a teacher is preferred.  MMY's classic ""one-liner"" [he was often known for making jokes that make an important point while being funny] for why TM requires a teacher is:   the ""technique"" of TM is ""innocence"" and it is impossible to continue to be innocent while learning from a book when the first instruction is ""now let us close our eyes.""  . &gt; It seems like a way to ensure that people have to go to a certified instructor, or pay for a program, to learn how to practice.   The cost of TM was originally justified about 55 years ago because MMY found that when he taught for free, people would have stopped meditating by the time he returned to a given city, so he started requesting a donation up front so that people would value what he taught them and increase the likelihood that they would continue the practice. By the time he started to train teachers about 10 years later, his followers had set up a formal organization with set fees, accreditation for teacheres, etc.  The current fee for learning TM is $1500 or the equivalent in most industrial nations. This is meant to entice the Oprah Winfrey's and Dr Oz's of the world to learn an elitist technique as ""the rich don't shop at a poor store"" to quote MMY. Both Oprah and Dr Oz were then inspired to have all their staff learn at the same exorbitant fee, which was MYY's goal in jacking the price so high: the elite set the policy and trends for the rest of the world, and the elite don't like to be seen as bargain hunting.  The rest of the world is also required to pay the full price, except that there are scholarships, grants and loans available for people with financial need (there is no sliding scale because they found that people like to game the system, which is yet another way of saying that they really don't want to learn and are just wasting the TM teacher's time and energy).  The [David Lynch Foundation](http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org) was set up to get the elite to donate [their time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJg5mKuCh7A) and/or money to allow disadvantaged people to learn for free and to set up aforementioned grants and scholarships.  .   &gt;Also, would you mind expanding on the ""dysfunctional behavior"" that you mentioned in your previous comment?  I had in mind specifically the incidents where buddhist monks set themselves afire in protest of war or invasion. The Dali Lama refuses to speak out against such actions, and in fact, there are classic Buddhist teaching stories that glorify such ""universal compassion,"" such as the story of the monk  who casually allows himself to get stung while helping the deadly scorpion (rather than use a stick) because ""it is my nature.""  Any relaxation or meditation technique, when practiced to excess, might lead to ""relaxation induced anxiety"" or ""kundalini disorder,"" but Buddhists revel in techniques such as mindfulness, whose effects can be gained by having a stroke, as occurred in the author of [_My Stroke of Insight_](http://www.mystrokeofinsight.com/) because the stroke happens to permanently damage the same areas of the brain that long-term mindfulness and compassion practices coincidentally depress permanently. Mindfulness and virtually all other techniques besides TM work by [compartmentalizing the brain](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912000596), giving rise to depressed speech centers that ""'Step to the Right' of your left hemisphere brain chatter in order to live a more balanced life"" and/or overly enhance one brain center over others in the name of ""balance."" Overwhelmingly active brains are touted as being a [Very Good Thing™](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526201/) by researchers into Buddhist practices, who note ""The high-amplitude gamma activity found in some of these practitioners are, to our knowledge, the highest reported in the literature in a nonpathological context (23). Assuming that the amplitude of the gamma oscillation is related to the size of the oscillating neural population and the degree of precision with which cells oscillate, these data suggest that massive distributed neural assemblies are synchronized with a high temporal precision in the fast frequencies during this state.""  Ironically, Buddhist meditation techniques are being promoted because their anti-stress properties have some ""significant"" effect on PTSD, even though it is well-known that long-term Buddhist monks with many years/decades of practice often need treatment themselves for PTSD because they can't meditate due to [flashbacks](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102373662).  TM's only real effect is to allow the brain [to relax ~~to~~ towards its theoretical minimum while remaining in an alert mode of functioning](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4124680926078&amp;set=a.2219338093698.2126866.1555020826&amp;type=1&amp;theater)  Edit: the compartmentalization and depressive effects of most forms of meditation are thought to bring about the various long-term spiritual effects of meditation practice, such as a quiet mind, happiness, compassion, feelings of oneness with the universe, loss of sense of self, etc.  In TM, all these effects are held to be due to ~~the same thing~~ one single state: pure consciousness.  Practice of TM allows the brain to relax towards the full-blown pure consciousness state and lets the nervous system repair/normalization the long-term effects of stressful experience. Regardless of how clear or unclear this state is during meditation, long term practice of TM alternated with normal activity, starts to give rise to a situation where the physiology of the brain maintains some pure-consciousness-like state, even outside of meditation. This brings about greater stability/less likelihood to incur new stress.   Eventually, this trait becomes so pronounced that the meditator notices pure consciousness as a silent background watchfulness aspect of their own self (recall that the EEG during TM shows integration of the-self centers with the rest of the brain, not compartmentalization or reduction in self-related activity).   This process continues over the years until eventually, the EEG pattern of pure consciousness becomes prominent enough that it is always present as a background state, no matter what kind or degree of activity, no matter if the person is awake, dreaming or asleep. At this point, the person spontaneously starts to identify this ever-watchful, never-changing self as their ""real"" self and becomes ""enlightened"": they are That ever-watchful, otherwise featureless component.  Someone who identifies with pure consciousness as their own self, initially sees all other things -thoughts, emotions, perceptions, intuitions, memories, actions, as ""not self,"" because such things are always changing -this is the beginning stage of the first ""state of enlightenment.""  Therefore:  the ""real you"" never thinks (and due to less stress, random thoughts and other random mental reactions become less and less likely over time anyway);  the ""real you"" is timeless because it never changes and is always present, even if you are asleep, dreaming or awake.  the ""real you"" is not attached to any moment because all moments are watched by the changeless Watcher with no distinction made between one moment and the next: they are all just not-watcher.  the ""real you"" is not attached to any object, any belief, *any object of perception whatsoever*, because the real you never changes at all, being simply That Which Watches (note that a similar description arises in mindfulness practitioners because the analytic and attention areas of the brain have become dominant, but obviously, it isn't the same thing on the physical level, regardless of how similar the description).  The theoretical end-point of this first stage of enlightenment is a situation where pure consciousness is the only thing that exists during meditation, and there is, in some sense, no distinction between meditation and non-meditation: there are no out-of-context thoughts or other mentation (you don't have an internal narrative or other mental speech save in the context of rehearsing a speech, or reading a book, or translating an unfamiliar language, etc) and random memories, visions, emotions don't pop up simply due to association with past events -its not that you don't remember -it is only that your memories and associations don't forcibly intrude on the present moment.  ""Higher states of consciousness"" beyond this are all predicated on the stability and permanence of this first state.   Maharishi Mahesh Yogi calls this state ""merely normal"" as it is what a normal healthy individual should mature into without any technique at all. He also refers to it as ""glorified ignorance"" because it is the state of maximal separation between Self, and the rest of the universe. It is, however a requisite for full enlightenment. MMY warns that this state can be confusing if you don't have an intellectual framework in which to place it, and might lead to intellectual discomfort, even worry, because you might think you are not normal, so even though intellectual understanding can actually be detrimental in growth towards [the first stage of] enlightenment, it is important to have at least a little bit of understanding of what lies ahead, or you might think [you are going crazy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2191357).

t5_2qh1i,Gavcradd,1359210376,"One of my friends at high school used to tell the most ridiculous lies - not little ones that might make him sound cooler, but huge, massive, stupid lies that made him look like a clown. Every time he did it, we'd all look at each other with a knowing smile, but no one ever called him out on it. Some of the highlights :  1) He frequently got his girlfriend pregnant, and sometimes even got it on with his girlfriend's mum. 2) He was always being stopped by the police for *massive drugs* but never got arrested. In fact, he once caught his dad (Ray) doing a bong in the garage (his dad was the usual middle-class white guy, probably never even smoked a cigarette in his life) 3) He used to go up to Manchester and fight with snooker ball in a sock 4) He stole his neighbour's jaguar and drove it up and down the motorway, evading police (yet when we learning to drive and he had a go of my car, he could barely pull off) 5) He saw a bald eagle land on his roof, so he got his shot gun out (hello, he was about 13 years old?) and killed it. 6) He had every computer game you'd ever heard of. When we were all playing Streetfighter 2, he had Streetfighter 3.  Anyway, I forgot all about it after I'd left school until I met him again one day in town when I was about 23/24. Literally, within the first 30 seconds of talking to him he was at it again. This time, he'd bought an old Nissan car but had paid extra to have a Ferrari engine put into it. When he drove it, it was so powerful that he crashed it but he conned the insurance company into paying out for a Ferrari.  I was in a band at the time, so he became the inspriation for one of our songs.

t5_2s48x,innociv,1359225451,"I saw this Lib land on the Crown pad from Zurvan Amp. 850m away, and only the tip of its tail was showing.  Hit it once, and then another shot and a pixel flinch of my mouse was enough to make me miss.  He takes off with 55% health, going past the crown tower where I can't get a shot and I think he's gone.  Then he loops around, inexplicably, smoking.  4+ seconds of round travel time, and I can't just throw a shot out there, but I see him level off.  Four seconds after the round is fired, the reload has finished and the round hasn't hit.  Aiming upwards, the gravity drop is pushing back against the shell, slowing it down. An 850m hit is about the same as a 950m one. (Conversely, aiming down speeds the shell up.  You don't have to lead as much, or account for drop as much)  Then he's burning and I'm holding my breath.  It's not rare to make an 800+m hit on a lib, but it's rare to actually kill them since it takes two shots or for them to already be low.  I wanted him to burn out so badly, or the shot isn't worth it.  *You're not even safe when you don't hover.*  On another note: any suggestions for music for my next video?  This shot in its completeness will be there.  Last time I had an issue with music copyright.  I need something that's Fair Use or Creative Commons.  I might just use the Soviet National Anthem if no one can suggest better.  Thanks. ♥  I remember someone posting a video of accidentally shooting a mosquito accidentally about 300m away when they were aiming for something else.

t5_2s30g,FrenchFuck,1359235089,"I think the idea of loving someone before you get into a relationship with them is phantasmagorical. It's a Disney™ flavor of love you get bombarded with when you're young. I honestly can't imagine a less natural way of being with someone than this, it's antiquated and wholly incompatible with the modern world where we are all independent. I won't deny that the fantasy is very appealing. I remember growing up with the idea of ""saving a princess"" in my head. Many of my first relationships were about me helping my girlfriend deal with issues she's had in her past, I thought I was useless only insofar as I could ""save her from herself"". Which is a REALLY messed up way of looking at relationships but that's how I thought because no one ever adequately explained love to me  Love happens OVER TIME. And it only exists after two people spend a lot of time with one another. I knew the women I fell in love with for 4 years before I even considered dating her and then when we did hang out I realized that my love wasn't reciprocated. That was a big shock but it was an invaluable lesson. Love needs to go both ways or else it's just a fantasy. I caution any young person not to fall for a fantasy, fall for the real person with all their flaws and issues, not the ideal of them you have in your head.   Relationships are about ATTRACTION, it doesn't matter how much you have in common and how perfect you think you'd be together, if there's no ATTRACTION it's dead in the water.",™

There are four easy rules to remember: The first two monitors can connect to the graphics card with any display output on your product: HDMI, VGA, DVI or DisplayPort.  **The third (or greater) display must be connected to the graphics card via DisplayPort.**  If your monitor does not have a DisplayPort connection, you will need an inexpensive active DisplayPort adapter for it. DVI to DP adapters can be had for less than $30 USD.2  Every family of GPUs supports a different maximum number of displays.   Remember that these are the most basic requirements. Creative designs like the Sapphire FleX HD 7950 or the MSI R7970 Lightning make it even easier to configure AMD Eyefinity technology by reducing, or even eliminating some of these requirements for AMD Radeon™ graphics products.

t5_2qhwp,karper,1359262981,"&gt; That would be a horrible ending, that's like jumping in a pool so you don't get hit with a water balloon.  My reasoning was that reapers are a force so overwhelming (the ocean) that there's no hope of surviving against them in a fight. Heck, Sovereign didn't even want to bother talking to you. But in spite of being so powerful, they don't simply wipe out life. That is the only card we have to play. If we threaten to destroy *all* life, (not necessarily act on it, but get that message to the reapers), then, maybe the reapers will tell us why they want to kill us, but not the rest of life. I really wanted it to be about how the use of the mass effect increases the dark energy in the vicinity of the galaxy and that the reapers were harvesting us so that the galaxy has time to heal. I hoped that maybe that the reapers were being the good guys and saving the galaxy.  &gt; There is a reason. It's frequently explained that the reapers' purpose is ...  a) Not buying it. b) ... but why???  &gt; why is this better than being the hero?  Because becoming a hero is always more exciting than being (or continuing to be) the hero.  Once you're awesome, there's nowhere to go but down. My version of mass effect would have felt more like the Foundation series. You inherit the past decisions and try to make the best of the present.  One of the things that I loved about the first game is how there are three alternate starting points and in each of those stories, you get to see what you could have become had you started at the other two points. You see what the raid on Mindoir does to a person of lesser mettle than you. You see what surviving that thresher maw did to a weaker person. You could have just as easily been them. Decisions you make need to shape not just the place around you, but you yourself. As things happened, there's hardly a character arc for Shepard after the first game. ""Dying"" and getting reconstructed doesn't count. :)  &gt; The story you play through is YOUR story because choices from the first game stick with you through out the whole trilogy.  This is a very good point. But in my version (ME: Foundation?), the choices would still affect you, only in indirect and subtle ways.  &gt; The sequels had the best story telling of the series.  Only for the sidequests. The sidequests were more involved, featured better acting and some of them were actually great stories.  But, the main story sucked so hard. In 2, the reapers are suddenly not only interested in life forms, but actually want to clone them? You could argue that they took an interest in you after the Sovereign thing, but come on, it can't be the first reaper they lost. Did they get obsessed with the first species they encountered every time? We are supposed to a blip in time for them. We die in a hundred years. They live for millions. Why would they even care, let alone obsess over us? And in 3, suddenly we have hope because of a deus ex machina device that everyone basically figures will work™.  This makes about as much scifi sense as... Star Wars. And the first game promised a grownup story (Star Trek?). :(  Also, the focus was obviously on making it a shooter. Suddenly, it's tactics this and strategy that. Some half-baked story is cooked up for giving us finite ammunition. If I wanted gears of war, I'd play gears of war (I do play gears of war, but that's not the point). There were very good things about the sequels, but the combat felt borrowed from other games. I suppose that worked and they made bank.  I missed the large open spaces. I missed exploring. I missed being suddenly terrified upon hearing the rachni singing while I was on a desolate planet at 2 am in the morning. I missed the feeling of continuity between sections that weren't separated by a ""YOU COMPLETED THIS SECTION. HERE ARE YOUR POINTS. ALSO, STARE AT THIS GUY SITTING THERE."" screens.  &gt; &gt; instead of humanizing Shepard, they instead resorted to hero(-ine)-worshipping him(her)  &gt; Could you elaborate? I feel like they did quite the opposite.  Sure. It was things like, ""Only Shepard can do this"", or ""Shepard is too important, so I'll die to save you"" type dialogs and actions of people around you. Anderson, for example has dozens of years of exemplary service, but somehow he can't set off on a similar mission. Shepard is allegedly responsible for killing thousands of people and is in jail, but s/he's suddenly super trustworthy and all civilizations will listen to him/her and is the right person for this. \*shakes head\*  I really shouldn't care so much, but I'm a bit of a hard scifi nut. And being one, I loved the first game, but the sequels' main story arc had me going wtf. So, tl;dr, I like to imagine how things could have been.",™

Shepard discovers the crucible, so he's got hope. It's pretty logical to exhaust all your options before pulling the *we'll all kill our selves* card. Plus, how would we kill all life in the galaxy before the reapers kill us? How would we convince every species to *kill themselves*? Especially when we've got this mystery super weapon. It doesn't make any sense.   &gt;I really wanted it to be about...  If you're disappointed because it didn't follow the story that you made up, you have unrealistic expectations.  &gt;a) Not buying it. b) ... but why???  It explains that they need to keep organic life from creating advanced synthetic life. I suppose because they want to stay the superior race  &gt;But in my version (ME: Foundation?), the choices would still affect you, only in indirect and subtle ways.  Again, this is fine, but just because it isn't your version, doesn't mean you should be disappointed. In fact you should be pleased that Bethesda can't read your mind.  &gt;In 2, the reapers are suddenly not only interested in life forms, but actually want to clone them?  They were indoctrinating them to use as an army. That's what you're fighting in the 3rd game.   &gt; Did they get obsessed with the first species they encountered every time?   They weren't obsessed about one species. They're trying to wipe out all intelligent life.  &gt;We are supposed to a blip in time for them. We die in a hundred years. They live for millions.  We die in 100 years, but our species and other species don't die in a hundred years. So we're more than a blip in time.  &gt;And in 3, suddenly we have hope because of a deus ex machina device that everyone basically figures will work™.  It doesn't matter how reliable the crucible was, it was the only option. And for what it's worth, Shepard finds out on Thessia that it's not just prothean, it's been passed down through tons of different intelligent species, being improved on each time. So that's a lot more credibility.    &gt;""Shepard is too important, so I'll die to save you""  when did this happen?  &gt;Anderson, for example has dozens of years of exemplary service, but somehow he can't set off on a similar mission.

t5_2qofe,Isemyn,1359304185,"&gt;Jag vill veta vart du får påståendet att 'homogent samhälle med den ökade stabiliteten det ger.' är sant.  Forksarvis kan vi se på Putnam's social credit och han är en multikultur grabb i spetsarna som blev förtvivlad över hans fynd. Det är även enkelt att peka ut balkanisering av i princip varje samhälle som har accepterat främmande folkgrupper i större utsträckning. Amerikanarna älskar att påpeka att deras problem med hälsovård och diverse bygger på att ingen känner någon så stark gemenskap. ""Fuck you i've got mine"" bygger på svag social kredit mellan och till och med inom folkgrupper enligt Putnam.  &gt;Om det tar 7 år för en invandrare att komma ut i arbete  Det tar 7 år innan staten skjuter in dem i något statistik-förskönande program. Då talar vi inte heller Europeiska invandrare utan icke-västerländska asylsökare.   &gt;Svensk individ att komma ut på arbetsmarknaden efter gymnasiet.   Det är en betydligt säkrare investering att satsa på ett enkel utlärt barn med 47+ års arbetsmöjlighet på nacken än en mellanålders analfabetisk Somalie med mindre än 30 års arbetsmöjlighet kvar om vi nu räknar in de 7+ åren som att dom leder till riktiga jobb. I det tidigare fallet tar även föräldrarna på sig en stor del av tidskostnaderna involverade.  &gt;Ser man dessutom utbildningsnivån i landet ligger storstäderna i topp  &gt;Och DN's undersökning av ungdomsarbetslöshet visar ganska tydligt att landsbyggden är överrepresenterad i statistiken.   För att de som utbildar sig flyttar till storstäderna där det finns jobb inom branscher annat än gruvarbete. Vi har ca 700000 Svenskar i Norge de flesta ungdomar från landsbygder som söker arbete utanför Sthlm.  &gt;(som att man hävdar att det är ett kulturellt problem som står bakom att invandrare är överrepresenterade i brottsstatistiken)   Det gör BRÅ också. Konstigt nog så kan man inte påstå att det är socioeconomiska faktorer som står för en grov överrepresentation av brott när de får socialbidrag utöver levnadsstandard.  &gt;Vi borde ju med SD logik (stäng alla gränser! Ut med invandrare! Hårdare straff, deportering etc) sonika avveckla majoriteten av den Svenska landsbyggden.  Så i princip att kasta bort bevisat humankapital och ungefär halva Svensk exportsektor för att du drar halvdana och rent ut dåliga jämförelser med en bevisad nettoförlust?  &gt;Kikar vi vidare på Socialstyrelsens rapport från 2011 om försörjningsstöd ([3] http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/18784/2012-6-58.pdf) sidan 12 ser vi att sk 'inrikesfödda' hushåll utgör ca 120 000 medens utrikesfödda (där båda vuxna är sk. utrikesfödda) utgör 85 000.  Du verkar ha missat delen där de 85 000 exkluderar flyktinghushåll vilket får siffran att gå upp till 115418 hushåll. Sen kan du kolla över sidan 20 för ekonomiskt bistånd där 4,5 miljarder går till inrikes födda hushåll och 4,9 miljarder där antingen den sökade eller samboende var utrikesfödd. Även detta exkluderar flyktingar som får 1,7 miljarder till på topp av det. Alltså   inrikes: 4,9 miljarder   utrikes: 6,6 miljarder i bidrag.  &gt;när det kommer till statistik och peka ut att det ser ju inte bättre ut än att SD's väljare är arbetslösa och har ingen eftergymnasial utbildning?   De som märker av invandringsproblemen först är generellt de som inte har råd att segregera sig från mångfalden i Stockholm Innerstad eller Danderyd. Sen var det en betydligt mer tveksam fråga att rösta på SD under de senaste valet än resterande partier. STEM utbildningar har i min erfarenhet aldrig varit lika invandringsförälskade som sociologer och journalister.  &gt;Min poäng är att tanken om att SD's magiska lösning på alla problem att stänga gränserna och 'göra någonting åt' invandringen är bara bullshit och totalt världsfrånvänd.   Det de säger är dock inte att ""stänga gränserna"" utan att skära ner på asylinvandringen med 90% för att bara ta in äkta flyktingar och att allokera pengarna som kastas bort i dagsläget till bevisat effektivare flyktingorganisationer som UNHCR.  Sen sparar Danskarna in miljardbelopp på deras restriktiva invandring och många inom Europa undrar uppriktigt sagt vad det är vi håller på med. Till och med EU's förslag om jämna asylintag skulle skära ner Sverige's intag med ca 65%.  &gt;Den saknar total grund i ekonomisk forskning, doktriner och historia.   Ekonomisk forskning är ju bland de mest positiva till den utöver USA-dyrkande liberaler som flip-floppar i frågan av politiska skäl. Resten av Europa har betydligt, betydligt mer restriktiv invandring och välfärdspolitik kopplad till den än vad vi har.   &gt;Och jag vill verkligen understryka det här med nationalromantiken som ett problem för en progressiv utveckling av det Svenska samhället, dels demokratiskt och dels ekonomiskt. Vi lever inte i en isolerad värld, vi är inte kulturellt homogena, och vi har aldrig varit det.   Nationell identitet motsätter inte handelsmän och entreprenörer av utländskt ursprung som Japan, Kina, Sydkorea, Öst-Europa och stora delar av Västeuropa t.ex. Finland och Danmark är levande bevis för. Romarna och Öst-Romarna i Konstantinopel var kulturella imperialister för övrigt. Atenarna hade åsikter™ om folk från andra stadsstater mycket mindre andra folkslag som Skyterna.  &gt;Att isolera oss kulturellt skulle, sett ur historiskt perspektiv, vara en nackdel.  En motsättning mot vissa främmande kulturers aspekter är inte kulturell isolation mer än en opposition mot kvinnoförakt är det.  &gt;Men om vi anti-islamiserar och anti-arabar och anti-afrika (för att Afrika är ju ett land.... ), varför skulle någon av dessa kulturer välja att ha bilaterala handelsavtal med Sverige?   För att vi har resurser som de vill åt. Afrika har inte möjligheter att välja och vraka utanför delar av Nordafrika. Mellanöstern säljer inte olja till oss för att Salafisterna i Saudi Arabien gillar någon av oss direkt.    &gt;Vad skall vi konkurrera med? Överbetalda ingenjörer? En obildad landsbyggd? Inkompetenta politiker?  Service, Humankapital, Unika industrivaror, naturresurser etc etc. Allt vi konkurrerar med i dagsläget. För att snacka så mycket om ekonomin verkar du inte ha särskilt stor koll på vår.  &gt;Vad är det den homogena kulturen skall göra egentligen?  Förbättra stabiliteten, integrationen och ge en starkare samhällsgrund för framtida generationer. Utanförskap uppstår utifrån olikheter som helt diametralt motsatta kulturer och osämja. ",™

t5_2sdua,Pokemen,1359328373,"Did fur around their face or neck look orange when you got them? If so, they were probably quite young. Chances are they were all related in some way anyway, knowing how stores that have them tend to cage them.  Another thing, did you get a new bag of hay recently? Something could have been in/on the hay, like arsenic (if a herbicide/pesticide was used) or aflatoxins. Also, if the goos ate a significant amount of that litter in a short period of time (assuming it's like the pine pellets like I have for my bunnies' litter box, that once liquid touches them, they 'melt' into a powder/saw dust), it is possible (not sure if likely) it have gotten impacted inside them.   Hmmm. Being lethargic is almost always a sign that something else is going on. It's possible whatever that goo had before is somehow related to what happened to them. Maybe some sort of internal parasite. Maybe an allergy or pneumonia. Possibly something neurological (but there should be other signs with that). Without knowing exactly what was wrong though, you can't really say, plus it wouldn't explain why they died at the same time.  And it's not a problem. :D If I had it my way, no goo would ever die, but that's obviously not gonna happen. I love goos so much, they've pretty much change my life. I've crammed so much stuff into my brain and I spent years answering goo questions on Yahoo Answers until I got so overwhelmed and disheartened by some of the stuff I was reading, and I had to stop or I would be depressed forever. (Unfortunately I'm seen some of the ignorance/selfishness on this sub too. Thankfully not a lot though) So I'm happy to talk about goos, even if it's sad. ♥",♥
t5_2re6a,Dorsel_Fin,1359328562,"**OK! Did not expect to come back and see more responses so I’m going to be typing away furiously. Sorry for such a long delay I suggest reading this in the voice of the narrator from the game bastion and/or Morgan Freeman:**   Now I got a peculiar little love story to tell. This ain’t a tale of forbidden love like Romeo and Juliet. Nor is it a tragic love like Titanic. No this story stars an M&amp;M® named Marshall. Now Marshall was a nice guy, he studied for a liberal arts degree and was trying to make a name for himself. Trouble was he was cursed. The young candy was one of the worst colors an M&amp;M® could be. He wasn’t red or blue or even yellow. Marshall was brown. Now before you folks start judgin’ that I am being racist I want you to consider the last time you were hungry for a brown M&amp;M®. Also he had telekinesis. Needless to say he was a black sheep in a white flock.   Anyway, back to the story. Marshall was at a bar one night, drinking himself into a stupor. Poor boy did that far too many times. Perhaps it was his 4th tequila talking for him but he happened to spot one of the most beautiful creatures he ever did see. The boy had a classic case of love at first sight. Only problem was, the apple of his eye was a platypus. For those of you who were asleep during elementary school history class you should know about the terrible, terrible war during the 60’s between the M&amp;M’s® and the platypuses (platypie? platypeople?). So even though that war was yesterday’s news, the  tensions were still there. But the boy knew it had to be destiny. So he took the chance and went up to the duckbill sweetheart, slammed his fist on the table and smiled “Names Marshall. I know telekenisis” He then proceeded to make the cup on the table float in mid air.   The platypus smiled and laughed. The trick was working its magic. Then the platypus did what any person would do if they met their soulmate; he ate the poor bastard marshall....  Moral of the story: Platypuses (platypie? platypeople?) love M&amp;M’s®  EDIT: oops, I totally forgot to add the quaracorn part... I'm sorry. I'll come back to this if you want and add more after I finish these other ones.",®

t5_2qhwp,Boffosaurus,1359360280,"That is definitely at the core of the problems.  You can, however, still make a great game catered to those controls.  It's a little easier on a tablet, since you only take up 10-40% of the screen rather than 30-70% at any given time.  Battlehearts (I think it's called) is a cool little game that I really liked that was well made, and made well *for* a mobile game. It was based on tapping, rather than rubbing invisible digital joysticks, and it took a literal hands off approach for most of the game so you weren't blocking your own vision most of the time.  I can see a clever developer taking a concept like Pokemon (or Digimon, Monster Rancher, what have you) and porting it to a mobile device quite easily.  Because you don't directly control the combatants, you can again have a more hands off approach.  Maybe you tell your critters who to auto-attack, and fire off recharging skills like an MMO.  Or perhaps even take it another step back and tell them who to attack, but only give them a command on how to fight, Aggressively, Defensively, etc, with how they perform in those fighting modes based on how you train them, which could be more complex in itself but require less on the fly action like a complex battle system would take.  With the fact you're carrying your creature with you always, the trading and battling from Pokemon-type games, or even fighting with the old Digimon toys or some of those Tamagotchi devices seems natural.  And with all of the data our mobile devices pick up, through wireless signals or scanning QR codes, it's easy to see something like a random battle system that occurs based on how you use your phone.  Generating monsters from a QR code like Monster Rancher did with discs and the like.  Seems like a cool idea, right?  Well too bad, here's Angry Birds: Ninjas™",™

t5_2r2jt,tinyberlin,1359404755,"Tampax Pearl packets don't sound like a bag of popcorn, and even if they did, periods are not something to be ashamed of. I think it's quite sad that women are *still* ashamed to be doing something as simple as changing a tampon. Periods only come, well you know, every month for many many years in a woman's life. It's normal and not embarrassing and should be accepted as such.   &gt;a CleanSeal™ wrapper—the first ever re-sealable wrapper for worry-free disposal  That's from their website. First and foremost the resealable packet is advertised as ""worry-free"" disposal. There is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT when throwing away a used tampon. You shouldn't care and no one else should, because it's also a normal part of using the tampons. I could understand avoiding odors or similar, but... bah, it feels like a very frustrating thing to me.  I do understand about the flashy color part- I do love me some colors. But one flash of color isn't going to make a period any happier. Periods suck, the end. A woman using them is going to think of the flashy color for a second and then forget it because the applicator is thrown away immediately If I sounded upset toward the women themselves, I apologize, because it is stemming from being upset about the marketing tactics in general. I'm really tired of companies that want to preserve a sexy and happy version of women, down to the insertion of a tampon. It's unrealistic, insulting and frankly revolting to my sensibilities. Women are not what media attempt to portray them as, and I don't want something like the tampons we put inside ourselves to reflect how media tells women to be. Do you understand my point a bit more?

t5_2qh03,i0dine,1359416842,"Here's the Encyclopedia Dramatica play-by-play of it [nsfw content obviously]:  &gt;The video starts out in a foreboding but harmless manner; a sealed glass jar sits between the bare legs of a man hovering above. The viewer's suspicions of what is to happen to the jar are quickly affirmed as the man begins to crouch down over the jar and forcibly insert it into his visibly lubricated anus. Just as the man finishes inserting the jar into his ass, a *crack* is heard from inside of the man's pooper and the lid pops off with a piece of glass still attached. From here, it all goes downhill, as the man begins to stand up and blood begins to slowly seep out of the man's asshole onto the floor below. The remainder of the video shows the man patiently trying to fish the shards of broken glass out of his asshole as the pool of blood beneath him grows larger. &gt;    But perhaps the craziest part of the whole video is how little reaction the man has to shitting out an assload of blood and broken glass. At no point in the entire video do you hear a single whimper, cringe, or ""OW THESE SHARDS OF GLASS ARE HURTING MY ANUS!"" And when the man finally finishes removing the last bits of glass from his torn butthole, though at the very last 1.5 seconds of the video after he has stepped back, a loud scream can be heard. Truly one tough (and incredibly sick) bastard. &gt;     &gt;    It should be noted that if 'Jar Man' had used the superior glassware of the PYREX® brand, all this nastiness could have been avoided.  &gt;PYREX®...you can stick it up your ass and it won't stab your rectum.",®

Naturalistic Buddhism would be an example of    &gt;a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, [especially the ""nature"", the cause and purpose only incidentally]  &gt;(but one of those that *isn't* considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies),   &gt;[in many cases] involving devotional and ritual observances,   &gt;and containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.   I'm personally satisfied that that works.  (Again based on my own experiences.) ",©

t5_2qiel,grigorescu,1359477298,"&gt; If the NHL didn't feel that there was enough Devils veiwership in your area, they can release an NHL Blackout to stop any channel from showing the game. That includes NBCSports, local affiliates, FSN, CSN, even NHL Center Ice, a package that allows access to all the league's games!  I'm not following you, and the link you provided only serves to make matters worse. From the link:  &gt; In the NHL, the policy has changed in recent years. Now, most national cable games are shown throughout the country. Occasionally, the league will grant its cable partner an exclusive window and not schedule any other games involving U.S. teams at that time. ... Additionally in the NHL, local and regional networks are not granted broadcasts rights for national televised games by Comcast's NBC broadcast network or cable NBC Sports Network, or during the playoffs, any Comcast channel showing an NHL playoff game.  Now, I used to have NHL Center Ice, and I never experienced any problems with blackouts. Reading their [documentation](http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26371):  &gt; **WHAT DOES NHL® CENTER ICE® OFFER FANS?**  &gt;NHL CENTER ICE is designed for you to be able to watch games outside of your local market (i.e. other then just your home team). It is the best way to follow the entire League.  &gt;Local games are generally available on your regional sports network (RSN) or an over-the-air network.  &gt;If you are in the local television market for a team or teams, whether they are playing home or away, you will be blacked out of their games in NHL Center Ice.  Ok, so this makes it sound as if all games are available - some are on NBC and NBCSports, some are on Regional Sports Networks, and some are on NHL Center Ice.  The NHL Center Ice FAQ goes on about blackouts:  &gt; **WHY ARE THERE BLACKOUTS?**  &gt;Blackout restrictions exist to protect the local telecasters of each NHL game in the local markets of the teams. Keep in mind that blackout policies and restrictions are different for every sports package that your system may carry. (NHL CENTER ICE is designed for the NHL fan who wants to see NHL games in addition to those which involve the team(s) in their local markets).  &gt; If you are located in a team's television territory, check your local listings for all locally televised games. NHL CENTER ICE is not able to televise these games.  &gt; If you are located in a team's television territory and their local regional sports network is not available on your current cable or satellite provider, you will not be able to see these games in NHL CENTER ICE. This is a distribution issue between the regional sports network and the cable/satellite provider. The blackout remains intact as the local regional sports network has the rights to these games in your area.   &gt; Blackouts are not based on arena sell-outs.  So, this makes it sound like the only thing blacked out in State College would be Pens games, which are available on Root Sports. Is that not the case? Am I missing something here? I don't know much about NHL blackouts, so I'm genuinely curious.",®

t5_2qiel,lmbrjck,1359481664,"From https://gamecenter.nhl.com/nhlgc/help.htm  &gt;Why do I receive a blackout message?  &gt;NHL GameCenter LIVE™ provides access to live games featuring teams outside your local viewing area. We refer to such games as ""out-of-market"" games. Games involving teams within your local market (both home and away games) and nationally televised games are blacked out on NHL GameCenter LIVE™. If a blackout message appears on your device it is because you are trying to view a game being broadcast either in your local market or nationally. To view live game video, select an out-of-market game in the schedule module of the application. For more information about blackout guidelines read below:   &gt;You may be blacked out of games on NHL GameCenter LIVE™ for one of the following reasons:   &gt;1. The game you are trying to access is being televised on a local over-the-air station and you are located within that station's signal.  &gt;2. The game you are trying to access is being televised on a regional sports network and your cable or satellite system falls within the distribution for that regional sports network (regardless of whether your cable or satellite system actually carries that regional sports network).  &gt;3. The game you are trying to access is being televised on a national network. In the U.S. this includes NBC, NBC Sports Network and NHL Network. In Canada this includes CBC, NHL Network™, RDS and TSN.  Honestly, I would advise reading this kind of stuff before making purchases. It isn't meant to allow you to watch teams that are not out of market, and they are not shy about advertising that. You're gonna have a really bad time if you only purchased it to watch you local team. Not that I don't think this needs to change, but I think it's important to be a little more savvy with money.",™

t5_2ut2g,mrsamsa,1359508013,"I'm not sure I can agree with PZ's approach here... Specifically, his attempt to bring science into areas where it is inapplicable seems awfully close to scientism to me.   I do agree that topics such as religious belief and politics are issues that require skeptical thought and should certainly be discussed by skeptics. But comments like these:  &gt;The arguments to exclude that topic have been strained and absurd; most commonly, we’re told that since the claims of religion are completely evidence-free and untestable, True Skeptics™ are not able to address them…and usually these gatekeepers are as bad as creationists in claiming that they have the mantle of science in so constraining their range.  seem incredibly weird. Of course science cannot address many of the issues related to religion (afterlife, metaphysics, ethics, many miracles, etc) because they aren't empirical claims about the natural world. To be aware of the fundamental principles of science, and to refuse to be ignorant of the philosophy of science, is *not* acting in a way similar to creationists.   The same applies to the issues of ethics and politics. Yes, we can use science to address hard facts in the area *after we have agreed upon the basic foundations of an ethical or political system* - but of course science is useless at, for example, determining whether we should adopt a political system based on reducing harm.   The main gist of his post is valid (i.e. ""And most importantly, should rational skeptics take a stand on these issues, discuss and debate them, and come to reasonable conclusions?"") but his attempt to tie it into science was a little difficult to read.

You like it?” Her frown deepens. “Why are you wearing Kate’s dress?” Oh… no. “Well I like this one and she doesn’t,” I improvise quickly.

I have plenty of clothes.” “Can’t I do something for my own daughter? Come on, Bob’s starving.” “Too right,” moans Bob, rubbing his stomach and assuming a fake pained expression.

From: Christian Grey Subject: Unfinished Business - definitely Date: May 31 2011 19:30 To: Anastasia Steele Are you being deliberately obtuse? I think you’d just asked me to unzip your dress.

From: Anastasia Steele Subject: Well… there’s always the weekend Date: May 31 2011 22:36 EST To: Christian Grey Of course I eat… It’s only the uncertainty I feel around you that puts me off my food. And I would never be unwittingly obtuse, Mr. Grey. Surely you’ve worked that out by now ;) From: Christian Grey Subject: Can’t Wait Date: May 31 2011 19:40 To: Anastasia Steele I shall remember that, Miss Steele, and no doubt use the knowledge to my advantage. I’m sorry to hear that I put you off your food. I thought I had a more concupiscent effect on you. That has been my experience, and most pleasurable it has been too. I very much look forward to the next time. Christian Grey CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. From: Anastasia Steele Subject: Gymnastic Linguistics Date: May 31 2011 22:36 EST To: Christian Grey Have you been playing with the thesaurus again? From: Christian Grey Subject: Rumbled Date: May 31 2011 19:40 To: Anastasia Steele You know me so well Miss Steele. I am having dinner with an old friend now so I will be driving. Laters, baby© Christian Grey CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. Which old friend? I didn’t think Christian had any old friends, except… her. I frown at the screen. Why does he have to still see her? Searing, green, bilious jealousy courses through me unexpectedly. I want to hit something, preferably Mrs. Robinson. Switching the laptop off in a temper, I clamber into bed. I should really respond to his long email from this morning, but I’m suddenly too angry. Why can’t he see her for what she is – a child molester? I switch off the light, seething, staring into the darkness. How dare she? How dare she pick on a vulnerable adolescent? Is she still doing it? Why did they stop? Various scenarios filter through my mind: he had had enough, then why is he still friends with her? Ditto her – is she married? Divorced? Jeez – does she have children of her own? Does she have Christian’s children? My subconscious rears her ugly head, leering, and I’m shocked and nauseous at the thought. Does Dr. Flynn know about her? I struggle out of bed and fire the mean machine up again. I am on a mission. I drum my fingers impatiently waiting for the blue screen to appear. I hit Google images and enter ‘Christian Grey’ into the search engine. The screen is suddenly littered with images of Christian: in black tie, besuited, jeez – José’s pictures from the Heathman, in his white shirt and flannel trousers. How did they get on the Internet? Boy he looks good. I move quickly on: some with business associates, then picture after glorious picture of the most photogenic man I know, intimately. Intimately? Do I know Christian intimately? I know him sexually, and I figure there’s a lot more to discover there. I know he’s moody, difficult, funny, cold, warm… jeez, the man is a walking mass of contradictions. I click to the next page. He’s still on his own in all these photographs, and I remember Kate mentioning that she couldn’t find any photographs of him with a date, prompting her gay question. Then, on the third page, there’s a picture of me, with him, at my graduation. His only picture with a woman, and it’s me. Holy cow! I’m on Google! I stare at us together. I look surprised by the camera, nervous, off balance. This was just before I agreed to try. For his part, Christian looks impossibly handsome, calm and collected, and he’s wearing that tie. I gaze at him, such a beautiful face, a beautiful face that could be staring at Mrs. Damned Robinson right now. I save the picture in my favorites and click through all eighteen screens… nothing. I won’t find Mrs. Robinson on Google. But I have to know if he’s with her. I type a quick email to Christian. From: Anastasia Steele Subject: Suitable Dinner Companions Date: May 31 2011 23:58 EST To: Christian Grey I hope you and your friend had a very pleasant dinner. Ana PS Was it Mrs. Robinson? I press send and climb despondently back into bed, resolving to ask Christian about his relationship with that woman. Part of me is desperate to know more, and another part wants to forget he ever told me. And my period has started, so I must remember to take my pill in the morning. I quickly program an alarm into the calendar on my BlackBerry. Setting it aside on the bedside table, I lie down and eventually drift into an uneasy sleep, wishing that we were in the same city, not two and half thousand miles apart. After a morning of shopping and an afternoon back at the beach, my mother has decreed we should spend the evening in a bar. Abandoning Bob to the TV, we find ourselves in the upmarket bar of Savannah’s most exclusive hotel. I am on my second Cosmopolitan. My mother is on her third. She is offering more insights into the fragile male ego. It’s very disconcerting. “You see, Ana, men think that anything that comes out of a woman’s mouth is a problem to be solved. Not some vague idea that we’d like to kick around and talk about for a while and then forget. Men prefer action.” “Mom, why are telling me this?” I ask, failing to hide my exasperation. She’s been like this all day. “Darling, you sound so lost. You’ve never brought a boy home. You never even had a boyfriend when we were in Vegas. I thought something might develop with that guy you met in college, José.” “Mom, José’s just a friend.” “I know, sweetheart. But something’s up, and I don’t think you’re telling me everything.” She gazes at me, her face etched with motherly concern. “I just needed some distance from Christian to get my thoughts straight… that’s all. He tends to overwhelm me.”",©

The film is directed by James Bobin (‘Flight of the Conchords,’ ‘Da Ali G Show’), who was just nominated for a BAFTA for ‘The Muppets’ (Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer), and produced by the Academy Award®-nominated team of David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman (‘The Fighter’, ‘The Proposal’). With a screenplay by Bobin and Nicholas Stoller (‘The Five-Year Engagement’), who is also executive producer with John Scotti, ‘The Muppets … Again!’ will feature music from Academy Award®-winning songwriter Bret McKenzie (‘Flight of the Conchords’), who won an Oscar® for best original song for ‘The Muppets’ (‘Man or Muppet’). The new film will hit the big screen March 21, 2014.  &gt; Disney’s ‘The Muppets …Again!’ takes the entire Muppets gang on a global tour, selling out grand theatres in some of Europe’s most exciting destinations, including Berlin, Madrid and London.

All rights reserved. Article printed with permission of the author.  I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel.  It's like this......  When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy.  You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum.  The Michelangelo David.  The gondolas in Venice.  You may learn some handy phrases in Italian.  It's all very exciting.  After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives.  You pack your bags and off you go.  Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, ""Welcome to Holland.""  ""Holland?!?"" you say. ""What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy!  I'm supposed to be in Italy.  All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.""  But there's been a change in the flight plan.  They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.  The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease.  It's just a different place.  So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language.  And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.  It’s just a different place.  It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy.  But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips.  Holland even has Rembrandts.  But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there.  And for the rest of your life, you will say ""Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.""  And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever  go away...because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.  But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland. *     *     *",©

When travelling in the Nether or entering a city, even if you've already been or even live there its important to ask the following simple question for safety reasons.  **""Are you 'raisinstens?""**  As you may know a faction called the ""HCF"" invaded recently and there's good a chance one there members will pearl you.

We are sure you'll prove to be a valuable asset not just to our organization but to our nebulous and often contradictory goals.   Once we've finished processing your application, you will attain the rank of *neophyte*, the lowest in our hierarchy. But don't fret, as a mysterious cabal we only promote internally - even the most influential outside person we recruit will start as a *neophyte*, while all our employees get the chance to quickly climb the corporate ladder. It's not unusual for newcomers to attain the rank of *acolyte* after their very first false flag operation! And in many cases, veteran GWD^® employees will outrank even those who wield considerable power outside of our organization - if you ever wanted a member of the United States Supreme Court to serve you a cup of coffee, you've enrolled with the right people!   Just to give you a taste of what's to come: after reaching the rank of acolyte, you can quickly advance to *Stonecutter, Half-Illuminated, Brigadier-General, Untersturmführer and Field Marshall* - and that's not even the entire list! Every rank grants you different privileges that will help you not only work towards our goal of World Domination but also enhance your personal life. Immunity from persecution, access to our global network of arms/drugs/human traffickers, discounts at WalMart, an actual license to kill and your very own corner office are only some of the perks that make this career worthwhile.   But before you can achieve all that - and more! - it might be helpful to set you on the right track towards becoming a successful and beneficial member of our little, omnipresent family. For this very purpose we have sent you our *NWO Inductee Kit* which will thoroughly prepare you for your future tasks. This kit should include:        - 15-minute training video: This short film will give you a rough overview of our illustrious institution. Please note that this video is *only* available on VHS\* as utilizing outdated formats greatly eases the task of keeping our secrets secret. And should you find yourself wondering why the most powerful entity in the world appears to create films with production values that mirror those of late-night cleaning product commercials - two words: plausible deniability.   - GWD^® glossary: A handy, compact lexicon of useful terms and common expressions. We place a lot of emphasis on our established phraseology and so should you - if our ultimate goal is global oneness, we should be able to speak as one. Also, it greatly helps us communicate our corporate identity. We're not just a cabal but a brand. And it is this brand we are trying to sell, not just death camps and mind control.   - GWD^® lanyard, basecap and sweater: spread terror and fear while spreading brand awareness!  - GWD^® training manual: Our very own *10 Things You Always Wanted to Know About World Domination But Were Afraid to Ask* will instruct you on topics as diverse as: Covering up secrets; Covering up secrets just badly enough so people will find clues; *A History of False Flags:* From the Gulf of Tonkin to Operation Northwoods; Manipulating the Media for Fun and Profit; *Shill or be shilled:* spreading disinfo in online forums and *The Almighty Jew:* Why they really are better than the rest of us.  - The GWD^® FAQ: A comprehensive list of the most commonly asked questions, such as *Is it still a conspiracy if everyone's part of it except Bob?*; *Why even bother with the conspiring if we already control pretty much everything?* and of course *Can I bring my pet to the GWD^® training barracks and where do I find GWD^® -sanctioned dogsitters?*  - 10 vials of *Vaxamort^®*: A proprietary, undetectable poison. Since assassinations are at the core of our business model, we've provided you with a sample of our preferred method of execution so you can get accustomed to the tools you will be working with - go ahead, try it on your friends!   ^\*VHS ^recorders ^can ^be ^rented ^for ^a ^fee ^of ^two ^Jewgolds ^at ^approved ^GWD^® ^safehouses  You will receive the rest of your equipment once you've successfully completed Basic Training at one of our facilities.

Just show your lanyard to any reception clerk at any federally-run facility to be pointed towards our in-house representative.   Furthermore, we wish to remind you that any leaks of official material can be traced and the cost of containing the incident will come out of your pay. You have been warned.

Our eligibility criteria stipulate that a child must be diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition, not a terminal condition. The process of making a wish is life-affirming and full of hope. For many children a wish experience becomes a turning point, renewing their courage and determination to fight for a future. Our wish children who are now adults would attest to this!  The 'what if the child recovers, won't people get mad?' concern is one that some parents may have:  &gt; Are families reluctant to accept a wish because it feels like taking charity? &gt;  &gt; There are several reasons why a family might hesitate to call us. A family might feel, for example, that they could grant a wish for their child themselves. Or they don’t want to take the opportunity away from a more needy family",®

This chemical has led to cancer and birth defects in lab animals, and may have led to birth defects in DuPont plant workers. In 2005, an independent panel reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared PFOA a likely human carcinogen.   If you use metal tools on a teflon (nonstick) pan, it's a good idea to stop using it at that point.  I recommend [ceramic coated pans](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068SEQJE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3S18O2QUU3XP2) (these are among the highest rated you can get a single one for like $30) because they don't lose their non-stick abilities and if you want, you can get away with using metal utensils in them.  Ceramic is the best.  edit: crappy ceramic sucks too. I highly recommend the ones I linked to.

In other words, the reason they end up at the top of many rankings is because the lowest students in Finland are comparatively high. While this doesn't sound like skepticism, what easy to point out is that this high equality is possibly only due to equality in the standard of living throughout the Finnish society.  2. ""There is no model"". Tying into the above, a further criticism is that noone can actually say what it is about the finnish system that produces such high standings. When you compare Finland and e.g. South Korea, they both end up at the top of most international rankings, but have different classroom climates, curricula, etc. So, it's been argued you can't really say what one thing is the reason for ""the finnish miracle""™  I've heard it all, everyone  has their own theory, but ultimately I think it's pretty clear.

While operating under the contract one might be exposed to confidential information that can hurt the company, you're obviously not allowed to reveal that information once your contract expires. This is outlined under the following clause in DURATION &amp; TERMINATION: &gt; Notwithstanding the foregoing *[termination]*, the rights and obligations set forth in the clauses entitled  “Indemnification” and **“Confidentiality”** shall survive, and is without prejudice to, the termination or  expiry of this SLA.

And additionally, they claim you had breached it when it was still in effect ([source](http://www.esfiworld.com/own3d-tv-files-for-bankruptcy-cannot-repay-all-owed-money/)). I'm sorry, I don't follow you really, I don't know if you had or hadn't streamed on twitch back then but if this could be proven, it would be a fundamental breach in the contract, one that renders it void. You can read about breaches and what a fundamental breach is [here](http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/text/peclcomp25.html). One way or the other, you are not entitled to the money unfortunately.

t5_2s9km,jcdyer3,1359638800,"It looks like a fun variety of exercises at a variety of difficulty levels, but it's not a very *useful* video, in that it doesn't show any progressions.  How do I, an ordinary dude, get to the point where I can do an [Ab Crunch Shredder Dip™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POdzasJklxw&amp;t=2m58s)?    Muscles don't know how many pounds are on a bar.  They only need to know contracting with more or less force to bend a joint (or keep a joint from bending).  With bodyweight exercises, leverage is key.  If you put your body at a mechanical disadvantage, you have to work harder to do a similar thing.  Think about raising up out of an Iron cross vs doing a dip, for instance.  Clapping pushups are a way of demonstrating that you've generated enough force to get yourself off the ground long enough to clap, so a triple clap is a harder progression from that.  But I agree.  It seems more like a dumb party trick than a great exercise.  Just clap slower on the single clap.   Stringing together backflips like in the backflip burpees, on the other hand, sounds great.  Think of it as roughly similar to an olympic lift for barbell athletes; it's an intense, sudden power movement.  Even that could be scaled for a progression, by altering the relative height of the landing spot.  ",™

Materials available through this program are: student workbooks, 7-minute animated video (available on DVD), instructor guides, brochures, and student reward stickers. Program materials are also available in Spanish.  [...]  &gt;The purpose of the Eddie Eagle Program isn't to teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children. **The program makes no value judgments about firearms, and no firearms are ever used in the program.** Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks and household poison, they're treated simply as a fact of everyday life. With firearms found in about half of all American households, it's a stance that makes sense.  [...]  &gt;**Eddie Eagle is never shown touching a firearm, and he does not promote firearm ownership or use. The program prohibits the use of Eddie Eagle mascots anywhere that guns are present.** The Eddie Eagle Program has no agenda other than accident prevention - ensuring that children stay safe should they encounter a gun. **The program never mentions the NRA.** Nor does it encourage children to buy guns or to become NRA members.  All the NRA is doing is *offering* additional materials and aids, for free, to anybody who asks for them.  I appreciate your skepticism, but really, it's unwarranted in this case.",®

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1359667179,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",™

t5_2qh2p,flyingwolf,1359668329,"&gt;I've seen scoliosis cured as well.  No, you haven't, if you had, and it was possible, and your god cured one person but not the millions of others afflicted with it then he is a fucking cunt.  What you saw was a person who wanted to believe and was able to temporarily ignore the pain thanks to natural drugs the human body releases during times of heightened fear/anxiety/happiness/elation. This is a well documented effect.  As for your daughter, this is simple, either the build up dissapted the exact same as it did on my daughter, which by the way happens often, it is simply a precaution to go to the urologist to check after 24 hours to see if there is still an issue, or it is also entirely possible that the doctor mistook your baby for another, it happens a lot more often then you think.  &gt;So its easy for that to go undocumented when doctors can't explain it.  No, actually when something cannot be explained it will be documented to hell and back so that it can be studied and the information can be found which explains it, unlike the religious scientists don't just throw their hands up and exclaim ""god dun it"" when something they do not understand happens. They search for the answer.  &gt;You want proof and its all around you. You've been blinded.  This is a cop out, you can claim anyone who does not hear the voices in your head caused by a growing tumor are blinded to what you hear.   &gt;As far as a rule to sell all of your possessions; that's not in the bible.  And I am the blind one?  Luke 12:33   New International Version (©1984) &gt;Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.  Seems to me someone has not actually read their bible. Here are all the rest of those translations in all of the different ""versions"" of the infallible word of god.  http://bible.cc/luke/12-33.htm   And FYI, it was in reference to the previous statements parable that jesus spoke about with the farmer with too many crops, to which he spoke about due to brothers feuding about an inheritance.  &gt;the closest would be when Jesus tells the rich man it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.  This by the way, is incorrectly translated, it was it is easier for a ROPE to pass through the eye of a needle, not a camel, both are similar, it comes from the word *gamla* which means rope in Aramaic, most likely because the rope was traditionally made form camel hair.   And yet, the word camel will continue to be used though it makes absolutely no sense.  I have no relationship with christ, you religious folks are getting real good at trying to spin things and simply ignoring what others tell you.   I have no faith in any supernatural spirits of holy men.  But oh I do have faith, I have three wonderful kids and i have faith that I will make the right decisions and they will turn out well. I call this faith because I have no proof of it, but I believe that I am a good man and a good father, and as such I will be able to pass that on to me kids.  I don't think your crazy by the way, I think you are deluded and lying to yourself. I also think that for those 20 years or so you were an atheist you were not married, and that you found god when you got married, but that is just an assumption. And I could be entirely wrong, but unlike you, if I am presented with evidence contrary to what I assume to be true, I will change my view. ",©
