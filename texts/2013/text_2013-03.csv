t5_2r81c,DaffyDuck,1362106360,"I don't know about other dark chocolate brands but at least with Dove...  http://www.cocoapro.com/about_cocoapro.html  Cocoapro®, a process developed and patented by Mars, Incorporated scientists, helps to preserve the cocoa flavanols that occur naturally and abundantly in cocoa beans. The Cocoapro® process begins from the moment the beans are harvested and continues through every step of the process from fresh beans to finished product. In the typical processes for making cocoa or chocolate, the flavanols are easily destroyed by time, temperature and moisture. Though processing of cocoa beans into cocoa products can and often does destroy the flavanols in cocoa, it is important to recognize that the destruction of flavanols begins from the time that the cocoa beans are harvested. Mars’ Cocoapro® process is different. This patented process centers around a gentler, less harsh way of handling and processing cocoa beans from the time they are harvested through the time that they are made into finished products so that all products made using this Cocoapro® process deliver more of the flavanols found naturally in cocoa. For over two decades, Mars has led the way in the development and use of analytical techniques to reliably identify and measure the flavanols in cocoa. This has allowed us to improve our understanding of which cocoa flavanols retained via the Cocoapro® process may impact human health. As a result of this commitment to research, Mars scientists have been able to develop processes that retain more of the naturally-occurring cocoa flavanols that matter. We have extensively studied cocoa – from what happens within the bean to what happens within the body and we continue to study cocoa today. But what has been foundational to the program is our analytical expertise, and Cocoapro®. Since the beginning our research program, we have been collaborating with scientists at leading universities and research institutions around the world in the study of cocoa flavanols, publishing ground-breaking research in the field. Cocoapro® is a patented process for preserving flavanols, but it is more than this. The Cocoapro® process has enabled an entire research program into the potential impact of cocoa flavanols on human health, a program that continues today.",®

t5_2qx1l,motherwarrior,1362126674,"Ok this is a ridiculously long reply on my part, but I want you to be successful.  My family is 2/3’s celiac and we have been doing it a long time.  Learn from us and it will make your transition easier.  As StarCass said:  ""Breath"".  First thing is don't panic, you can be sad, and you can be angry and you will probably deny it, but in the end you will (believe it or not) be so happy for the diagnosis that you will never look back.  It will take time to learn but this group has given you some good advice.   What is Off Limits: In short these are the things that are off limits : Wheat in all its forms (einkorn, durum, faro, graham, KAMUT®, semolina, spelt, freekeh, bulgur), rye, barley, spelt, and triticale.  Also don’t eat oats unless they’re certified gluten free.  The reason for this is oats are often shipped in the same containers as gluten flours, so cross contamination is possible.  There is a lot of debate about oats.   Eating Out in the Morning/Restaurants:  You have been diagnosed in a golden age of gluten free products, and many restaurants are now providing gluten free entrees. Ok if you like to eat out in the morning this is the best way to find restaurants.  Whatever city you live in go to your favorite browser and type in “Gluten free “Your  Cities Name Here.”  E.g “gluten free Seattle”, If you live anywhere of any size you will find that you should get a link that says something like glutenfreeseattle.org.  You can find restaurants and stores and everything you need.  We have traveled all up and down the west coast using these websites and have not been gluttened once and found some amazing restaurants.  I have found Yelp and the Urban Spoon have pretty good gluten free recommendations.  I would suggest double checking though because restaurants are starting to claim gluten free status, when they don’t have good practices at keeping gluten free foods clean so you can sometimes get glutened due to bad kitchen practices.  That is why I like the gluten free .org people so much.   Baked goods:   Don‘t worry about goodies, it will take a while to find the good stuff, but believe me it is out there. If you like to bake you are golden.  If you don’t like to bake head to a Whole Foods or your towns equivalent for they usually have lots of gluten free baked goods.  There a lots of fabulous baked goods mixes out there all mixed you just have to add butter and moisture:  I use Bob’s Red Mill a lot.  http://www.bobsredmill.com/.  However, I don’t like bob’s gluten free flour because it uses garbanzo beans and I can’t help, it I don’t like bread that tastes like beans, not to mention my son projectile pukes garbanzos.  The cakes, and the brownie mixes don’t have garbanzos.  Educate Yourself I am a firm believer in educating yourself.  Knowledge will give you power.  So here are few websites: -The Celiac Disease Foundation:  http://www.celiac.org/index.php  If you want a primer on what to eat and what not to eat:  start here. -Living Without – get yourself a subscription to the magazine and sign up to get onto their site:  http://www.livingwithout.com/ -This is Dr Peter Green’s site from Columbia University a long time researcher:  http://www.celiacdiseasecenter.org/CF-HOME.htm -Dr Allesio Fasano is another research who has been in the field for a while he just moved from  Maryland to Mass General:  http://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1723  My Favorite Recipe Books  -Gluten Free Classics by Annalise G. Roberts – Seriously the chocolate chip cookie recipe is beyond fabulous.  Absolutely follow the instructions and do not use butter.  Not to mention her pasta recipe is simple and great.   -Carol Fenster’s – 1000 Gluten Free Recipes:    I did not buy this book for a long time because I thought it was going to be filled with recipes that would not have gluten in them to begin with.  My husband checked it out from the library and the maple coffee cake tasted better than coffee cakes made with wheat.  I went and bought my own.  I have not made anything bad out of it. -My original recipe book was the Gluten Free Gourmet by Betty Hagman – I still use her bread recipe although now I mostly buy bread because it is available.  The chicken pot pie recipe is all the comfort food you could want.  The Corn bread recipe is some of the best I have ever had.  I made the macaroon recipe and  I had 4th graders fighting over them.  And last but not least the pizza dough is stunning.  Ok, you are probably bored reading this, but as I said above I along with all of the other posters want you to be successful.  It is not the end of eating good food, it is just finding different good food.  Good Luck!  I hope you feel better. ",®

t5_2qhx4,NoGrainsNoPains,1362139855,"I was reading this article by Frederick C. Hatfield the supposed creator of the SSB:                                          ""Your hands are not holding the bar. This allows you to grasp the handles on the power rack. Because of the heavy loads involved in squatting, there is a tendency to ""round"" your back and place unnecessary stress on those easily displaceable intervertebral discs. This is avoided by exerting pressure against the power rack handles and thus maintaining a perfectly straight back throughout the entire squatting motion. Using your hands to spot yourself prevents you from falling forward or backward.  Squatting with a straight bar, you're forced to use a load that you can handle in the weakest position. This results in using an inadequate amount of weight in the strongest position of the squatting motion.  This problem is solved by use of the hands in the Safety Squat Bar™. When the ""sticking point"" is reached, the hands can be used to help you through it. This unique feature allows you to work with heavier weights in the ranges of movement where you are strongest and gives you help when you are weakest. You are exerting closer to your maximum effort through the entire range of motion.""

You can put what you want on your bumper, you can't on your license plate.  The proper analogy is that the D.C. DMV can't force you to get an ""I ♥ Obama"" license plate. Teachers also can't prevent their students from writing school newspaper editorials with which they disagree; nor they can't prevent students from writing about politics at all.  &gt;Plenty of government agencies have a newsletter of some sort or another.......Schools are the single worst analogy you could have picked.  School newspaper editorials are actually the best analogy, in my opinion. In the case of newsletters from government agencies, the communication is actually sourced from government agents ex officio. In the case of both school newspaper editorials and license plates, the communication is from private citizens, using resources that belong to the government.  &gt;To repeat, the piece you are missing is that law considers the plate as the DMV's speech, not yours.  It's too bad that this is factually incorrect. Or do you think that someone at the DMV really loves tennis when you see a ""10SNE1"" license plate? Can legislatures now redefine what speech is for the purpose of passing laws that would otherwise be unconstitutional? That's absurd.  A decent alternative would be to ban personalized license plates altogether. Once you allow people to choose their own license plates, the contents of those license plates are *their* speech, not the city government's. The intellectual difficulty with this is that the license plate belongs to the city, but the words stamped on it are the speech of an individual. If the city lets people choose what's on their plates, it's necessarily conceding that the speech content of those plates belongs to the car owner (when they pay the fee to get a personalized plate). If the speech belongs to an individual not acting for the government, the government can't restrict it.",♥
t5_2qh16,AdorableZeppelin,1362147589,"I think one of the main contributing factors for low demand is that the general population have no idea what speeds mean in terms of the internet, and I think ISP's want to keep it that way. The general population have no idea what a megabit is, or how to convert that into a megabyte, and even then they don't really know what a megabyte is. You'd have to translate that into some form of media like ""10 megabits per second is about 1 itunes MP3 every 4 seconds,"" and even that wouldn't work with most people.

t5_2s3qj,highguy420,1362150606,"I have actually spent at least as much time researching parallel supercomputing systems as I have bitcoin mining, the only problem is that I never found a good use for a cluster or a business model that would allow me to afford the hardware to build one.  I have the technical ability to implement either or both, however I'm a year late.    And I'm talking about a warehouse full of custom-built PCs with 5 video cards each custom cooling, etc.  Once you build that for mining, you have a bunch of modern computers (if it supports 5 video cards, it probably supports dual or better processors).  Add $50-100 to the cost of each system and you have two businesses in that same warehouse.    I'm not sure whose hardware you are planning to run random code on, but that was never part of my plan.  And if it was implemented as a distributed system the actual third party code would have access to a specific, limited subset of capabilities and would run at a lower priority than the other desktop tasks.  This is exactly how Prime95 and Seti@home work.  They don't give arbitrary access, they allow a specific, limited, virtualized environment that the third party can use at a lower priority than the actual owner of the hardware.    Distributed supercomputing isn't just giving someone access to the computer.  For example Google® allow anyone who wants the ability to execute arbitrary code on their active, running servers.  They are just commodity PC hardware that are running a specific environment that allows third parties to execute discrete pieces of parallelized code in and with other users', and their own tasks.  They use the map-reduce framework for that.  Other distributed supercomputer systems use more common systems, but the point is that your assumptions are simply incorrect both for a cluster wholly owned by the operators, or a distributed one.",®

EVE Online Featured in Applied Design at The Museum of Modern Art February 26, 2013  Award-winning sci-fi online game visualizes a day in its universe   March 1, 2013: EVE Online®, the massively multiplayer online game celebrating its tenth straight year of growth, has been acquired by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) as one of the first fourteen video games to enter its permanent collection. The famous New York City museum’s new Applied Design installation opened to the public this afternoon and will run through January 31, 2014. It showcases a collection of video games selected by a panel of industry experts, amongst other media and artwork.   For its portion of the exhibit, CCP Games created a “day in the universe” visual experience that brings the museum-goer on a journey in the EVE Universe through the everyday actions of some of the more than 500,000 inhabitants from 230 countries around the world. A call for submissions of personal gameplay recordings from EVE players yielded genuine, real-life gaming experiences from a single day in EVE history that were then combined with 1.2 terabytes of data from EVE’s server databases and Big Data storage into a larger narrative representing the massive sci-fi game and player interactions within it.   “We couldn’t imagine telling the story of the EVE Universe without putting our players and their actions front and center,” said Torfi Frans Olafsson, Creative Director, EVE IP Development Division. “The exhibition was such an inspiring project to work on. Seeing our universe under the same roof as so many other legendary works we love makes that collaboration an even more meaningful honor.”   The MoMA exhibit is one of the first leaps for EVE Online as it hurtles into its second decade, following shortly after its 18th and most successful free expansion, Retribution, launched in December. Other major upcoming EVE events include a sold-out EVE Fanfest, CCP’s annual player festival in Reykjavik, Iceland, and EVE‘s official May 6th tenth anniversary.

The second one is definitely a bit more out of the box, the addition of the © symbol in this one is something that is appealing to me for some reason. It's edgy and bold.   Number 3 and 4 are very similar and I like these both a lot as well although I am more inclined to the minimalistic and slanted 4th design. It's elegant and looks professional.  As I already said, it all depends on what you want to appear like to your customers. If it's supposed to be bold, youthful and fun yet not in a playful childish way, then it's #2.

t5_2vizz,Ridyi,1362223644,"&gt;**NP is being unable to contemplate suicide and calling anyone who does ""fucked up in the head.""** NP is further attacking the self-worth of suicidal people (making them more suicidal!) and claiming you're ""helping"" them. NP is the fact that Right To Die only applies to physically terminally ill old people, and even that gets attacked.  Mental disorders are diseases. (Serious or dangerous) suicidal thoughts are symptoms of said diseases. If someone was hurt or ill in another way, I'd say the same stuff.   If someone hit their head or was bleeding and started walking towards a moving train, I'd say they can't because they're not in any state to decide to do that.  If someone broke their arm, I'd say their arm was fucked up, or (and this is probably a little more awkward compositionally) that they are fucked up in the arm. Because they are. Because you aren't supposed to be like that.   These are the same people who say:   &gt;Neurotypical privilege is never wanting to change your neurotype.  You want to change it *because you're messed up*.   This is coming from someone who has mental problems. Guess what? I want to change them. They're not an excuse or cute and if I were in such a messed up frame of mind that I wanted to kill myself (and it's important to say that I mean as a result of the illness or at a time when it isn't clear, because I don't disagree with assisted suicide for the terminally ill), I'd hope someone could stop me.   Many, many, many people who've attempted suicide (and, obviously, survived) say their last thoughts were regretting doing what they'd done.   **Edit:** Also, this pisses me off most of all:  &gt;Neurotypical privilege is responding to someone telling you about their neurodiversity with”You’re stronger than this”  People tell this to people with cancer. If you're depressed or have intense anxiety or OCD and you fight it and maintain your life, you *are* strong and you *are* stronger than the illness. That's a good thing, not a damned insult and it's not undermining your status as a person or your disease. It's telling the person that they can live whatever life they want.  But I guess that's for people who don't want to play the Oppression Olympics™, huh?",™

t5_2qh6c,FieldsofBlue,1362240111,"I think this is an area where the word believe is used ambiguously and misleadingly. I don't believe in scientific theory, I look at the evidence and research that's been done to investigate it and consider it a valid explanation of a natural phenomena. Faith is the belief in an idea or theory without any evidence and is entirely contrary to the scientific process. Faith also doesn't allow itself to be edited or revised with newly discovered details &amp; evidence. This is why I don't consider my understanding of science to be any sort of faith; I can't examine the evidence and theory behind a god and consider it a valid explanation for the world just like I wouldn't have faith without evidence in a scientific theory. That would make the theory entirely un-scientific.   Besides that point, atheism is ONLY the lack of belief or disbelief in a god. This doesn't pertain to just the most popular theology in North America (Christianity) but all religions that make a claim of a god. You are an atheist in regards to Islam and Hindu. Atheism doesn't make any distinction in a person about their understanding of scientific theory. It is quite possible for somebody to not believe in a god and also not research the alternative theories.  ♥",♥

t5_2ri0h,Kichigai,1362259827,"Everyone else has handled the editing-in-H.264 thing, so I'll try and address the other points.  I'm guessing since you have Adobe Premiere you also have Adobe Media Encoder. You can use that to transcode video if/when you need to. If not, and you're running a Mac, I'd look into MPEG StreamClip, QuickTime Pro, maybe Squeeze if you want to drop some cash. For a PC I'd suggest SUPER© and QuickTime Pro, maybe (QuickTime on Windows is pretty bad, but it gets the job done). You may not want to transcode from H.264 for this project, but that doesn't mean some time in the future someone won't toss you something you *do* want to, or need to, transcode (for example: many H.264 cameras, HDV, and MPEG-2 from DVDs, and most downloaded videos compress frames in groups of 7-15, which makes frame-accurate editing difficult, so transcoding it to a format without **G**roups **o**f **P**ictures would be advantageous).  Now, I have no idea what you're planning on putting together with this camera. If you're looking into make your own short films, consider [this guide](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Movie_Making_Manual).  There are plenty of guides on how to edit, [some in video form](www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRCWV5PJAJk) but I suggest you actually get a book and get used to using the help documentation. I also suggest you have a project in mind to learn on. Have an idea of what you want to be able to do, and then just *do* it. When you come to a point where you don't know what to do, go into the documentation or the Internet and ask how to do it. So for example, if you've got your video and you're wondering ""how do I get it from my camera into the program?!"" then go look it up! You'll definitely want a basic guide to start from, so you know where to start, but my advice is just have a project to work on.  For example, when I wanted to play around with the Stereoscopic 3D stuff in Avid Media Composer 6.5 at work, I figured my brief project would be a quick tour of the office, and when I had a question, like ""how do I assign which video stream to which eye?""

t5_2ss33,Hammido,1362263702,"Perhaps I'll give LoS a new chance, then… But having tried the 3DS Demo… I got extremely disappointed. There's NONE of that charm, that soundtrack, the incredible skill, the less-linear feel there… Instead we get a clunky God of War/Pan's Labyrinth masked up with a good story and voice acting with only 10% of what the franchise was known for.  Seems like the Spanish crew were eager to throw in the spirit of Pan's Labyrinth (yes, I'm looking at you, LoS and now Mirror of Fate) referring to that ibex-looking guy and the weird, out-of-place 'humorous' trolls of Mirror of Fate.  There was nothing wrong with the 3 DS-games, they had the fresh spirit of Castlevania in them and Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP was just BLOW-AWAY &amp;lt;3 … So to sum it up again… MercuryStream did a great job making a whole other game than Castlevania®. The only thing Castlevania® in LoS and onward is the Belmont-clan, Dracula and a whip. Thanks for nothing, Hideo… But I will try LoS one more time.  For the love of God, Koji Igarashi – come back… Hideo Kojima and MercuryStream, stay away from Castlevania® and Hideo, get back to doing incredible Metal Gear-games.  EDIT: Oh, and Harmony of Despair was unbearable, I agree with that.  2nd EDIT: Having read Ben's post more thoroughly this time, I'll surely give LoS an honest chance of full play-through.

I don't think the stepping works though, in your case, you need a big space... So I think even, with just a tad more gap between panels would really highlight it. It's also too high. The gap between the bed and art is too great. At the least lower them all to be even with the lowest one, or even better, lower them all to be about even with the lowest arm of the lamp, or the bottom of the lamp base fitting.  I think your mirror may be hung to high in relation to your dresser, and the dresser could use a few accessories that tie all your colors together...http://www.houzz.com/photos/88713/Gorgeous-bedrooms-by-Europeo-contemporary-bedroom-other-metro  For curtains, a [full wall of floor to ceiling curtains could be really elegant](http://www.houzz.com/photos/1842475/Urban-Loft-Residence-contemporary-bedroom-other-metro)  Without dimensions it's hard to know if a chair would fit, but I imagine, it's not big enough for a comfortable one...

t5_2v620,OniBait,1362275805,"She is correct in that ForgeBukkit apparently hasn't been updated in a while.  MCPC+ is what I would deem as the logical successor to that project. In short, it is Bukkit with Forge and some ""glue"" code in-between the two so both Forge mods and Bukkit plugins work.  On a more technical level, it is running the Spigot branch of CraftBukkit. Spigot being a bit more experimental optimized version of the code.  As far as plugins and compatibility... for the most part, things ""just work"" like you would expect them to. As long as the mods and plugins call the respective APIs (Forge or Bukkit) they are fairly compatible. It is almost as simple as replacing your minecraft.jar with the latest stable MCPC jar. All your existing blocks/worlds should be just fine, but always make a backup 😊, and I let all my players know that there might be issues due to it and to report them if they need to. I've been blessed with good users though, and even the occasional world rollback by a day (my own fault) have been taken in stride.  That being said, there are some occasional bugs. Whether it is a bug with the mod or MCPC I can't tell any more. The latest example I have would be enchanted books being shoved into barrels by a factorization router with a RP tube feeding it seems to ignore the specific enchantment on the book.  The biggest amount of bug fixes currently seem to center around trying to raise Bukkit events for Forge block changes so that protection mods can intercept, log, override them. I do know that Towny is used by a lot of people running MCPC though. And while it is a lot of reading, the MCPC thread has a lot of that info buried in it.  There is also a thread on the ftb server admin forums here: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/mcpc-forgeessentials-bukkitforge-bukkit-mods-kind-of.11182/  Let me know of you have more questions.

I guess they appreciated their kids seeing the power of please and thank you, or they appreciated that they were decent folks and they should get some free stuff too!

t5_1rqwi,catcradle5,1362292950,"&gt;Java is the thing that everyone now blame, but yesterday it was the Microsoft platforms, and tomorrow it will be something else. its not about what’s more secure, its about what Hackers focus on.. at the end of the day, we should always look at the shortest funnels to cash, just like Hackers do.  I disagree with this overall sentiment. Allow me to rant for a bit.  Java sandbox vulnerabilities are, or at least were for many, many years, absolutely, positively the #1 most reliable way of spreading malware via a web browser. That is the main reason why they've been discussed so much: a Java zero-day can easily result in a massive number of infections in a short amount of time. Due to the power of Java zero-days, more and more people have tried to find bugs in it. *That* is why many hackers have focused on it.  Java exploits have propelled cybercriminals in a massive way. In the past, exploit kits would typically only infect people running old versions of IE and Adobe Reader, both of which auto-update quite frequently. And often they are not terribly reliable: they're platform-dependent, there's often a long browser freeze before the shellcode executes, etc. With all the Java exploits in the past few years, just about *anyone* has the potential to get infected. If you are using Firefox, without NoScript or anything similar, and you visit a news site or blog or comic that happens to have a malicious ad, or was hacked, with an iframe to an exploit kit containing an unpatched Java exploit, then that's it. You're owned. It will run with 100% effectiveness if your AV doesn't catch it (and your AV probably won't catch it if it's new and the authors weren't idiots). You will not see any indication that Java ran at all, most likely. And even in the case of a patched flaw, Java updates only once a week and requests to update are often closed by users, only for it to come up again in another week.  Look at any exploit kit panel's infection statistics overview. You will see a bar graph/pie chart with ""Java (90-95%) - Other (5-10%)"". This is why Java exploits are a Big Deal™.  Thankfully (or unfortunately, if you're a cybercriminal/black hat), with click-to-play implemented browserside and in Java itself now, things are going to mostly go back to how they used to be, at least for Java. The people who will get infected will most likely be using IE, most likely clicking anything on any prompt they see, and most likely not very computer literate. ",™

t5_2rbzz,jarvis400,1362313588,"I believe the nicotine amounts in pipe tobaccos (or cigars) aren't generally measured nor cited. I don't think it's mandatory anywhere in the world. Personally I think this is A Good Thing ™.  I'm generally all for consumer rights and product safety and information, but in the case of pipe tobaccos I'm actually glad that measuring and citing nicotine levels is not (yet) mandatory. Imagine the cost burden for all blenders. The smaller ones especially. I'm guessing here, but if measuring nicotine content in all the blends became mandatory, we pipe smokers would probably have very few blends to choose from.   In the cigarette industry the required tests are made in standardized ""smoking machines"" which measure the amounts of nicotine, tar and CO2 *delivered*, by simulating a typical cig smoker (knowing how many variables there are in pipe smoking, I don't even know if a similar pipe smoking robot would even be feasible). Again, it's not the amount of nicotine that the tobacco contains but how much is delivered.  Also, delivery doesn't equal *absorption*. I'm not a chemist (or a smart man in general) but I recently learned that that even if two pipe tobacco blends contain the same amount of nicotine in the leaf, it's the pH of the smoke from the burning leaf that causes how much nicotine is typically absorbed. Smoke from Burley leaf is generally more alkaline (higer pH) than Virginia and this causes body to absorb nicotine more readily. When you calculate in all the variables in peoples' personal body chemistry, smoking style, filters etc., a number cited on a tobacco tin might actually be pretty meaningless anyway.",™

People in the area had never seen this phenomenon before, but they also reported that there were less mosquitos than they would have expected, given the amount of standing water that was left.

However, reading his other post, it sounds like he actually means it's just revealed during the touch down, but hidden again on the touch up. I think this is actually a clever idea.  Most users don't hold another area of the view pressed while they're using their phone, and definitely not while they're typing.   However, now that I think about it, users do sometimes have the expectation that tapping outside of a field will dismiss the keyboard.   Perhaps the most intuitive style for this control would if it was revealed when pressing the inside of the text field. Oh, did I miss a letter? Let me just hold to reveal, scroll to the letter I missed, type it in, and be on my way.   Actually...that's a brilliant idea.™",™

t5_2rfbh,GentleCanadianFury,1362332070,"No problem.  I think you'll find, though, that the reason most text completion engines on OS X tend to skip over keyboard shortcuts is because OS X is *very* keyboard-shortcut oriented if you're willing to learn them.  In addition, most applications (even 3rd party) tend to be extremely consistent in to the sorts of actions they associate with different keyboard shortcuts.  Much much more so than Windows (of which I was a dedicated user from 3.1 -&gt; 7) or most desktop *nixes.  In addition, OS X uses modifier keys to output special characters at the system level in any text field.  What you would use ""alt codes"" for in Windows can be very quickly output using keyboard modifiers and regular keys on OS X:  ßå∑´®ßåƒåßƒœ∑´ƒˆ∆…å˚…å∆ß∂ƒ∆œ∑πˆ´®∆ƒå…ß∂˚∆ƒ  Stuff like that.  For these reasons, I'd recommend you try to escape your comfort zone a little bit and give TextExpander or something similar a try.  I use both TE and KM, but I don't use KM for any sort of text input.  I enjoy the powerful input options and the ability to manipulate almost all of my apps directly from the keyboard with very infrequent use of the mouse, so I try to preserve existing shortcuts as much as possible.

t5_2qh1a,voiderest,1362349591,"Its not really buyer beware. It should really be assumed that any game bought through steam contains DRM. Often the store page of a game will say there is DRM on top of steam's. GTA IV was an interesting one. (Steam DRM, Windows Live, and Rockstar Social (the last one was the worst and actually put me off from buying anymore rockstar products)) The humble bundle games offered their own downloads outside of steam too.  &gt;To make use of the Software, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.  [STEAM® SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) - 2. A.  As far are the evils of DRM go it isn't like most of the programs are needed for the user to do something productive nor does it compromise the system any more than any other binary. (NOTE: There is some non-game software on steam however they are mostly content creation products like 3D-coat. Most of the users of these sorts of programs would probably be using something from adobe or similar company with their own DRM.) A vast majority trouble I've had with DRM through games on steam has been from third-party DRM that would have been included in retail or developer owned downloads.  The big thing about steam is that their approach to DRM actually adds value to the product. Their system updates my games and helps me join a game a friend is playing. I can access the games on any computer steam is installed on if the game supports the OS. I don't have to mess around with cd-keys or pre-reqs as steam handles it. There is an offline mode that can be used. I can gift games and trade games that have not been linked to my account without risking getting scammed through their trading feature. Valve actually makes many users want to use their DRM and tries to reduce it getting in the way. Then there are the sales that probably wouldn't happen without a large store.  The ownership/subscriber issue of steam is a legit issue but that is really a side issue of the DRM and goes beyond steam. I'm pretty sure such legal wording was a part of retail software agreements when users bought physical copies and didn't even have to option of downloading.",®

t5_2qi1v,kovos,1362354976,"I dropped out of high school to take care of my little siblings after my father left home and my mother died of leukemia. I was working two jobs but it still wasn't enough to feed them all. So, I used what little money I had saved up and got them a house with a caretaker, and went on the road. I decided I would make my money a less legal way. I started with back alley stick ups and smash and grabs. Eventually, I met up with some guys that seemed to know what they were doing and pulled a few big jobs. We robbed banks, held people for ransom, crazy stuff I never thought I'd be doing in my life. Well, eventually my reputation caught up with me and although I was able to secure a future for my family with all the money I had stolen, I was forced to leave the country.  However, one of the people we screwed over during our time pulling heists was a very well connected international arms dealer. I had decided to travel around since I couldn't return home and ended up working on a cargo ship. I didn't know anybody would be looking for me so needless to say I wasn't prepared when our ship was attacked one night in the middle of the pacific ocean. The men dropped in from a few helicopters just as a storm began. We didn't know why they were shooting at us, we just knew we had to survive. I ran below deck to wake the crew that wasn't already up and that's when the ship began to flood. A submarine, presumably operated by the same men that dropped down from the choppers, had launched a missile straight into our hull. As we scrambled up the stairs and ladders to get back on deck we ran into some of the attackers. I ducked into a corridor to my left and used my D914™ Series Impact Tool to quickly take out the screws in the ventilation shaft above me. Then I crawled inside and made my way to the surface. I used the D914™ Series Impact Tool again to bludgeon the back of one of the attacker's head who was standing right in front of me, killing him. I had never killed a man before, but to survive, and hopefully return to my family one day, I did what I had to. The ship quickly capsized and I fell into the sea with only a life jacket and my D914™ Series Impact Tool. The battle had ended and I later found out that the same men who had attacked us were not only there to take my life, but also believed that I went down with the ship.  A few days passed as I drifted through the ocean, lucky not to have been shark bait when a passing boat came upon me. I was allowed on board and eventually made my way back to the United States and to my family since I was officially listed as dead. I started my old life under a new identity and have never looked back. It's been four years since I returned and it would never have been possible had I not purchased the D914™ Series Impact Tool during my travels. I love the D914™ Series Impact Tool and Fluke Networks.

I also have fine hair and haven't managed to figure out how to gently condition my hair with oil without making it look greasy. A drop isn't enough and before I know it, it's greasy. So, I prefer to oil before I wash. What do you think about mixing clay with shikakai?

I was an advocate of using spaces just as you suggested, but being able to set the indent width myself by using tabs and a setting in my favorite editor *would* be a nice thing to have. I'd lose the ability to properly align comments that come after the line of code, though, so there'd be a trade-off.  However, as you said, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea™—which is why PEP 8 exists in the first place.

The equation they have formulated, x (fl + no ) / p, takes into account the length of the joke's build-up, the comedic value of the punchline and the groan-inducing qualities of puns.The best and worst jokes are awarded values on a sliding scale from zero to 200, with 200 being the funniest.A comedic value is determined by multiplying the funniness of the punchline (f) by the length of the build-up (l). This is added to the amount someone falls over (n) to the power of o -- the ""Ouch"" factor of physical pain or social embarrassment. The total is then divided by the number of puns, which reduce laughter.The ""perfect"" joke would therefore score 10 for punchline and length and contain a high number of pratfalls or social embarrassments but no puns. So many traditional gags, such as the ""doctor, doctor"" or ""knock, knock"" jokes that have short build-ups, no falling over and end in puns, score poorly.For instance: ""Doctor, doctor, I swallowed a bone. Are you choking? No, I really did"" would be represented as x (2 x 2 + 0) / 2 with a measly score of two points.Shaggy dog stories, however, with lengthy build-ups, tend to score in the higher end of the spectrum.The formula has been developed by a neuroscientist and a comedian as part of a forthcoming event at the Science Museum in London that aims to prove the hypothesis that science can be funny.Helen Pilcher, the neuroscientist and science writer for Nature magazine who co-wrote the equation, said that good jokes could be written by following the formula's rules but that stand-up comics also needed a helping of natural talent.""I think you can apply the formula when sitting down and writing gags,"" Pilcher said. ""Audiences respond well to well thought out jokes. However, for a stand-up comic to be truly funny, they need to incorporate a large degree of spontaneity into their act. Of course the formula can't teach someone to be relaxed and funny on stage but it does help when you need a prepared gag to fall back on.""  © Times Colonist (Victoria) ",©

t5_2qh6c,Jordoom,1362421124,"&gt;  ""currently we see no objective verifiable evidence proving the existence of God."" It can make no concessions, or allusions, to any other conclusions. Scientific method cannot even address ontological issues, yet atheists would like people to believe that science has somehow disproved God's existence.  This needs to be said more.   IF there is a God, and He/She/It at all resembles the traditional Christian understanding (is very or all-powerful, has a will, a plan, etc.) then the suggestion that we could prove God's existence is unscientific.   God would be powerful enough to ""avoid"" or remain detected from any materialistic and purely empirical grasp at trying to see/hear/touch/smell him.    And, assuming we could (or, as the Bible says, *have*) done it once or twice, we have no guarantee that He would allow it to happen again, or when, or under what circumstances.    I mean, the very concept of ""will"" and human desires is what causes social sciences to be ""soft,"" because we can only predict human trends, not every single human choice.    How more pronounced would this limitation be with a god?      I realize that this means a lot of atheists of the world would have to resort to other methods of knowing (rather than the comfortable position of ""Science™ says there is no God... Whaddaya mean, what science?  Just 'Science,' bro! Look it up!"")   ",™

His body was found on Wednesday, February 26, 2013, beaten, dragged and burned (set afire),” his family said in an email released through his campaign manager Jarod Keith. “This was reported in our meeting with the local coroner on two occasions. We were informed that the official autopsy report could take two to four weeks to complete.  “We feel that this was not a random act of violence based on the condition of the body when it was found. Marco, nor anyone, should have their lives end in this manner.”  His family went on to say in the statement that McMillian shared with them before his death that he was concerned about his safety, and that they want a “full and thorough” investigation into his murder.  “We feel it is important to share this information to dispel speculations surrounding his death,” McMillian’s family stated.  McMillian, 34, was found Wednesday by the Coahoma County Sheriff’s Department at the base of the Mississippi River levee near the communities of Sherad and Rena Lara in the southwestern section of the county, about 15 miles from Clarksdale.  Coahoma County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Will Rooker said Monday in an email that he is working with authorities to confirm the information released by the family about McMillian’s death.  McMillian was reported missing after authorities discovered his sports-utility vehicle was involved in a two-car crash Tuesday on Miss. 49 near the Coahoma/Tallhatchie county line.  McMillian was not in the SUV. It was driven by 22-year-old Lawrence Reed, who police charged Thursday with McMillian’s murder.  Reed of Shelby, Miss., was taken to the Regional Medical Center at Memphis where he was treated for his injuries from the car wreck. He was released on Saturday and was taken to the Shelby County Jail at 201 Poplar.  Reed waived extradition Monday in a Memphis courtroom.  Wearing a sling for his left arm, Reed told General Sessions Criminal Court Judge Louis Montesi Jr. he did not want to challenge extradition to Mississippi to faces charges in the death of McMillian.  A hold was placed on Reed and Mississippi authorities will be notified that they can take him into custody at the Shelby County Jail.  Reed, 22, was airlifted to Memphis following a two-car crash on Tuesday near Clarksdale.  The circumstance surrounding McMillian’s death remain under investigation.  McMillan, a native of Clarksdale, announced his candidacy for mayor last month. He said he entered the race because he wanted to combat crime and bring economic development to the city of 17,000 people. He is believed to be one of the first openly gay candidates to run for office in the state.  A graduate of Jackson State University, McMillian was CEO of MWM &amp; Associates, a professional consultation firm for nonprofit organizations. He was former International Executive Director of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.  “Marco, was loved by his family and a valued member of the Clarksdale community, as he offered himself to serve this community as mayor,” the family said in the statement. “He was actively campaigning to improve the quality of life for the citizens in his beloved hometown. Marco had shared with his family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety. We will miss our beloved son and family member.”  © 2013 Memphis Commercial Appeal.

t5_2uuwv,Ravanas,1362432779,"&gt;Please keep this in mind as you read this comment and the other comments here. You are clearly feeling traumatized by what happened, and those feelings are valid. You have a right to those feelings regardless of whether or not you eventually conclude that what happened to you was rape.  &gt;What happened to you would never hold up in court as a rape case (very likely mine wouldn't either, this is not a judgment of you), so just for now let's try to divorce your experience from his experience. For the rest of this post whenever I use the word ""rape"" remember that I'm talking solely about the emotional implications for you, not the legal/moral implications for him. We'll get there later, but first I think we need to focus on you.  &gt;Legality aside, you were there and I was not and therefore you are privy to details and nuances that I don't have access to, so if you consider it rape then it's not really possible for me or anybody here to say otherwise. A lot of the details of my experience that make it Definitely Rape™ are things that I have never tried to accurately describe to another person; they are simply too hurtful for me to remember or discuss, and I don't think I could do them justice anyway.  &gt;Without getting into too much detail about myself, I'm also very familiar with the situation of being depressed and not being in a sexual mood at all, and I have an intimate understanding of the pressure/guilt/fear of abandonment that you describe. It's difficult to avoid those feelings even if the guy you're seeing is a saint about the whole situation; there are societally-imposed narratives at work that push their way in even when both people involved are feminists.  &gt;Regardless of whether or not you feel that what happened to you was rape, this absolutely, definitely, without a doubt was coercive, and coercive sex can cause mental/emotional trauma just like rape can. A month is nothing, and even if it had been a year, it wouldn't have been fair of him to dangle the threat of being dumped over your head, and to sigh and pout at you and guilt you into it.  &gt;So the question is, what do you want to do now? If you want to end the relationship you are absolutely within your rights to do so - you are always within your rights to do that. If you want to try to save the relationship - and you may be able to, because remember, you have access to details and nuances that we don't, and you're the only one in a position to see whether there's something here worth saving - I strongly recommend that you find a neutral third party, like a therapist, who can help you both have a fair and productive conversation about what happened and what each of you need going forward.  Never mind that it was a troll.  The fact that somebody over there took it this seriously shows the same attitude as if the OP weren't a troll.    Of course, in their defense, at least what I quoted wasn't being upvoted too.",™

t5_2s7cl,NapTimeAllTheTime,1362433668,"I just checked their site and on the FAQs it says the following:   * I'm pregnant and want to take the Herbalife® products during my pregnancy. Which products should I take?    All nutritional supplementation during pregnancy should be discussed with your prenatal physician. Optimum nutrition during pregnancy is important to maintain your health and to minimize problems during pregnancy.  Although Herbalife® products are safe to be consumed by most adults, a few Herbalife® products bear a warning statement indicating they are not recommended for pregnant or lactating women.   * Which products can lactating women use?    New moms should give their body time to adjust to the various changes that occur during pregnancy and after delivery. A strict calorie-reduced diet is not recommended during breastfeeding, since breast milk production and quality can be affected by low calories. There is an increased need of about 300 to 500 calories while breastfeeding. With guidance from your doctor, moderate exercise may promote some weight and inch loss.  If you are lactating, you should not use any products, unless you are reviewed and cleared by your doctor.   It's nice that it says there are products you can't use, but it doesn't list them. I know this isn't really the info you're looking for (ie peoples' stories) but it's just a little extra info :)",®

Well I did, but after a suspend my browser crashed so what you get now is reply version 2.0..  &gt; I don't have facebook  Thanks for making me aware that facebook sucks again❣ I complained about this for years, but during the last 1-2 years public comments have actually been public. Now they are not :( Fortunately I'm using g+ mostly ([my g+](https://plus.google.com/101033166451928102064/posts)), which does not have this deficit.  &gt; so if that background is essential, maybe you could post it here  not really, it was just me trying to be lazy (or efficient ;)  &gt; What do you mean by conditions?  When the spaces have become *orthogonal*, or merely, as we may not speak similar metrics, simply independent.   &gt; i just see two separate spaces which encompass infinite possibilities  Yes, there are certainly a manifold of different independent possible spaces.  &gt; What is the relationship between these spaces?   One space is implemented by being a *subspace* (or possibly merely to be seen as *superspace*) of some other space. Think about some spaces, like math, programming, electronics, economics, thinking etc. The program running on a CPU is completely independent upon the underlying implementation (if we ignore such things as power failure or component failure).  &gt; and what constitutes their fulfillment?   The way I'm thinking is evolutionary systems. Consider an individual human being, which evolved into the current shape long time ago (regarding my theory about evolution following an exponential or even hyper exponential rate quickly reaching a plateau).  Primitive beings are quite dependent upon their surroundings. When humans evolved they started to become more independent upon their surrondings with agricultural development, people making their own clothes, vehicles etc.  Human beings evolved a society, currently at a very primitive level, as e.g. a decision, like an economical decision, working on an assumably independent ""subspace"", can imply drastical consequences for its surroundings and their own future on the planet. Thus the society so far is not very developed, the society is not yet able to implement artificial conditions that are independent upon the world the society is implemented in.  From my view, the society, when sufficiently evolved into a *permaculture*, will be in balance with the planet and its surroundings. Decisions taken by a being won't be a threat towards its own or its planets future.  The society implies, when sufficiently evolved, with technology, free information and knowledge, that also the individual can become independent and stand upon its own, independent upon the society.  This is what I meant by both conditions being fulfilled.  * Society, with technology and social structure sufficiently advanced to be sustainable.     * Individual, due to shared knowledge and sufficiently advanced technology, is independent upon the society for its survival and wellbeing.      &gt; what is the mathematical definition, can you write it in maths?  I'm not that skilled in formal math, especially not when it's about mixing spaces of completley different measures, but I hope my intuitive description can help understand my thinking.  &gt; how does that lead to this view?  why is it the only possible view?  I claim it is not automatically leading to this view, and it is therefore neither the only possible view.  **My worry and my confidence** is that **we need to ""design"" the future and the singularity**. I'm myself working on such a project, which will help the individual becoming less dependent upon society, being based upon constraints which implies that sharing (especially information and knowledge) is beneficial for the individual, thus **self organizing towards a benevolent future society** with *sustainable technology* and *independent individuals* that are *no longer ""slaves""* under other's despotism.

t5_2sode,LordIntrepid,1362452835,"&gt;Allow me to rephrase: it's not a feminist issue because it's not an issue where the root cause is gender.  I'll have to stop you right there. It's a lie to say that genders don't choose occupations differently. Physically demanding or dangerous work has always been male dominated (more physically demanding/dangerous, less women). This stems from our innate difference in muscle strength and desire to protect women from harm (and probably the fact most people don't enjoy physical labor). Many, many, laws in society used to prohibit women from working in area's simply because they were to dangers at the time, but technology has changed that for some of those.  (^ This is not detailing EVERY variable,  I'm trying to keep it short)  Even in this day and age, most women will only choose jobs that are not physically demanding (""We need more women in positions of power and in COE positions!"" seem familiar?something missing?), and nobody will fault them for that. But a man? MAN UP, get it done. Totally not gender. This has been the ""system"" since well before even the hunter gatherer state of man.

t5_2w92e,Kuldebar,1362460468,"That's a loaded question, Mark Jacobs would probably ask you what you meant by ""living up to DAoC""? (subscriber numbers or boxes sold, etc.)  As for making a come back in the PvP-centric MMO, well it won't be a comeback (unless you mean Mark) because the game will be a brand new beast focused on providing a three realm PvP experience in a fantasy setting with heavy RPG elements.  PvE is off the table, standard leveling, off the table -right from the start that makes it something quite new.  &gt;This is not my former concept re-skinned, not simply Dark Age of Camelot 2 with a new name. If you are looking for a bold new vision for these legends, just as Dark Age of Camelot was a new vision back in 1999, look no further. If the idea of a Tri-Realm™, RvR-focused game where there is no PvE grinding, no gear grinding, no “instanced-based PvP/RvR” but with a entirely player-owned and crafted economy and where your choices matter, all set within a truly open and persistent world appeals to you, then I hope I’ve piqued your curiosity. And most importantly, if the words “server pride” and “realm pride” hold a special place in your heart; then I welcome you to my vision, our world and one day, with your help, a place where you are not merely reliving the legends of Camelot, Vikings and the Tuatha Dé Danann but forging them yourselves.

t5_2qhwp,bucketpickaxe,1362463561,"I really think they screwed themselves over by keeping the Region/City terminology from SC4.  You see, what you know as a City in previous games is, effectively, a Region in this game.   (the game unlocked for me, in Malaysia, last night; been playing)  The Region is made of several Cities, connected by premade highways or railroads that you cannot change.   Usually when you created a city in the previous games, you ended up doing this very same thing anyway: filthy factories here, looong highways, houses here, commercials there, port here, etc.    The Cities themselves are **directly** involved with each other.   One City may have a huge oil deposit. Nice. Go to another City, create some residential areas, and once you have a nice population going, go back to Oil Land and start drilling.   You'll get skilled and educated workers from the Residential City you just prepared and Residential City will get oil from here so you won't have to import.    This other City in the Region covers a beautiful coastline? Awesome, start plopping down an airport, hotels and tourist attractions. Keep the dirty goods productions in your industrial Cities so that Tourism City can remain clean and beautiful.  You can also build sewer and garbage facilities in the other Cities so the tourists will never see the filthy side of Your Region™.  You see, the whole damn Region is your ""City"" in this game!  By allowing you to work on your Region together with friends by segmenting the areas into smaller Cities, they are making a Multiplayer SimCity that is very very fun!  Of course... you can still play alone if you want, and it'll be almost the same game you've been playing. (not exactly because while in one City, others in the Region are paused)",™

t5_2qh03,bucketpickaxe,1362473165,"(this is a copypaste from myself, but it's relevant)  I really think they screwed themselves over by keeping the Region/City terminology from SC4.  You see, what you know as a City in previous games is, effectively, a Region in this game.   (the game unlocked for me, in Malaysia, last night; been playing)  The Region is made of several Cities, connected by premade highways or railroads that you cannot change.   Usually when you created a city in the previous games, you ended up doing this very same thing anyway: filthy factories here, looong highways, houses here, commercials there, port here, etc.    The Cities themselves are **directly** involved with each other.   One City may have a huge oil deposit. Nice. Go to another City, create some residential areas, and once you have a nice population going, go back to Oil Land and start drilling.   You'll get skilled and educated workers from the Residential City you just prepared and Residential City will get oil from here so you won't have to import.    This other City in the Region covers a beautiful coastline? Awesome, start plopping down an airport, hotels and tourist attractions. Keep the dirty goods productions in your industrial Cities so that Tourism City can remain clean and beautiful.  You can also build sewer and garbage facilities in the other Cities so the tourists will never see the filthy side of Your Region™.  You see, the whole damn Region is your ""City"" in this game!  By allowing you to work on your Region together with friends by segmenting the areas into smaller Cities, they are making a Multiplayer SimCity that is very very fun!  Of course... you can still play alone if you want, and it'll be almost the same game you've been playing. (not exactly because while in one City, others in the Region are paused)",™

t5_2qhwp,SeductiveMango,1362474500,"DRM stands for Digital Rights Management, which is basically a way for a game company to make sure that the people who are playing the game actually paid for it. DRM isn't bad in of itself, in fact it's understandable as to why it exists. The problem is when that DRM prevents us from enjoying the game we purchased. DRM that requires a constant internet connection is one such DRM.  Imagine you go out to buy some soup (a game). Now depending on where you go, you will often get the choice of ordering the soup for take-away (singleplayer) or decide to eat there at the restaurant (multiplayer). Let's say that you enjoy sitting at home to eat your soup, so usually you just go to the register where you order a bowl of chicken noodle and they hand you a receipt (DRM). You then proceed to show that receipt to the server who then gives you your soup since you have proof that you bought it and you go on your merry way.  Now the DRM that is in this version of SimCity would be akin to being forced to eat your chicken noodle at that restaurant. Sure you can go sit in the corner, eat there, and not talk to anyone. But you came in a pair of pjs with a rip in the crotch, so you much rather be home. The restaurant tells you at the counter that they will be serving your soup to you at your table one spoonful at a time, and if you do not recite your receipt number when they come to you with each and every spoonful, they will assume you did not pay and kick you out of the restaurant (You must stay online to prove that you paid. If you get disconnected, they will assume you didn't pay and kick you out of the game).  Now they say that they do this service for everyone just in case someone doesn't have the ability to feed themselves (calculations are done server-side so people with out of date computers can play the game). So you appreciate the gesture, but you feel that you are more than capable of feeding yourself. A couple bites in, you find that the carrots that are usually found in chicken noodle are nowhere to be found. You ask the server and he says that the carrots were prepared that the same as the soup and if you'd like, he can go ahead and add them for an extra charge (day one dlc/micro transactions). You begin to suspect that this may have been an attempt by the restaurant to make you pay more for the soup, as you probably could have just added carrots at home (game modding). A bit of time later, your friend Jonathan come over and gets some soup. The soup is now cold, so they have sold it to him at a lower price (discounts due to the age of a game). He goes to sit down and receives two spoonfuls of soup when the manager decides to kick everyone out and that they will not be selling that style of chicken noodle again (servers for the game are closing). Everyone who is there is complaining that they still wanted soup, and the manager says to come tomorrow when they will have a new recipe of chicken noodle that features white meat instead of dark meat (SimCity 2 with any improvements it comes with). While people start saying how much better white meat is for you, you will always miss having your dark meat chicken noodle. And you end the day thinking ""If I was able to bring a bowl home with me, I'd be able to eat leftovers tomorrow...""  **TLDR: EA may be the soup nazi from Seinfeld**   EDIT: Wow, this has been quite interesting. While this just started out as an attempt to help someone understand why there was so much hate towards the SimCity DRM, it's turned into a library of information that can allow him to form his own opinion on the matter. If you have felt that I've left something out of this post, please remember that this is merely an introduction I cobbled in a few minutes time and not a grand dissertation. And with that I thank everyone who participated, and many thanks to the person who sent the gold my way. ☺",☺

Selecting 4WD Lock via the electronic, console-mounted switch locks the front and rear driveshafts together; the two then rotate at the same speed and provide a 50 front/50 rear torque split, providing better traction on slippery surfaces. This transfer case allows for 2WD, 4WD high-range and low-range as well as neutral.""  ",®

Thank you for your consideration. --------------------------------------------------------  Mitzi gets Marilyn (Fdom/F, catfight, celeb) A Story by Kim and Ginny (no address)  ***  BACKGROUND: In Hollywood in the 1950's, Marilyn Monroe  was justifiably considered by nearly everyone in the  industry as a major star. Although Mitzi Gaynor was a  premier singer and dancer, she never was regarded in the  same way as Marilyn. Nevertheless, for a few years in  the mid-1950's, both ladies stars shown brightly with  roles in movies such as ""Some Like It Hot"" and  ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" for Marilyn and ""South  Pacific"" for Mitzi.   This incident occurred in 1954 on the set of the movie,  ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" Twenty-four  year old Mitzi played Katy, a dancer, and twenty-eight  year old Marilyn was, ""Vicky"" the hat-check girl who  fell in love with Donald O'Connor. In 1954 while the  movie was being filmed, both women got married although  Marilyn's brief marriage to baseball star Joe DiMaggio  sadly ended before the picture was released.  Consequently, both actresses were under considerable  stress in their private lives in addition to the strain  of appearing in a big budget movie.  According to Hollywood insiders, there was friction on  the after Marilyn Monroe was brought in to provide a box  office ""boost."" To convince her to accept the role, the  studio promised her the lead in ""The Seven Year Itch""  the next year. To further accommodate her, they gave  several songs that had been written for Ethel Merman to  Ms. Monroe. It didn't endear Marilyn to the other women  in the picture, especially the aging Merman.  Unfortunately, Marilyn's notorious tardiness only served  to further aggravate matters. Ethel had been angry with  Marilyn since she arrived on the set, but was too  ""professional"" to show it. Instead, she befriended young  Mitzi Gaynor and poisoned the young dancer toward ""that  slutty blonde.""  One day Mitzi Gaynor, already a consummate pro at the  tender age of 24, was seen going into Marilyn's dressing  room for a ""private meeting."" My description of what  followed is based upon information from several sources,  much of it admittedly unsubstantiated and uncorroborated, but still it makes for a fun read so we wrote a short  story about it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as  we enjoyed researching and writing it.  - - - - - - - -   Everyone on the set could see the anger on Mitzi's  pretty face. The auburn-tressed actress was an awesome  sight in her shiny gold mid-thigh, wrap-around skirt,  dance tights and tight, low-cut, bolero jacket as she  stormed out of the rehearsal intending to give Marilyn a piece of her mind. Mitzi was about 5'6"" and her firm  120-pound body was that of a well-muscled dancer. While  not big by the Hollywood standards of that era, her 34C  bust, tiny waist and flared hips nevertheless gave the  illusion of a busty figure. Mitzi's legs were her  outstanding feature and they would play an important  part in the events to come.  As was her habit, Marilyn arrived late to the studio  that morning and she was sitting in her dressing room  holding an ice pack on her face to reduce the puffiness  from a late night of drinking with her husband, his  brothers and friends. She'd just asked her maid to get  her costume when Mitzi burst through the door without  pausing to knock.  Mitzi was wearing her little gold dance outfit and high  heels as she pranced into Marilyn's dressing room as the  blonde was lazily starting to apply her make up.  Marilyn, in a rose colored silk robe, black bra and  matching panties had her back to the door. She saw  Mitzi's reflection in her mirror, but didn't react to  her rude intrusion. Mitzi slammed the door behind her  and stood behind the seated Marilyn, tapping her foot  impatiently.  She started to tell the blonde how rude and  unprofessional her behavior was, forcing the others to  wait while she slept in. Marilyn calmly continued  putting on her make up while Mitzi ranted about her  being self-centered and droned on about it being wrong  of her to arrive late, leave early and not even show up  still other times.  Marilyn listened in stony silence (perhaps knowing much  of Mitzi's criticism is true). Mitzi, realizing that she  wasn't getting any reaction, next turned her criticism  on Marilyn's lack of acting talent in addition to her  lack of professionalism. Much or what she said was  merely a repetition of what Mitzi had heard Ethel Merman  say, but it stung Marilyn nevertheless. When Mitzi  grabbed Marilyn's shoulder and pulled her to her feet,  however, the blonde had finally taken enough abuse.  Then Mitzi said, ""Hell, even if you do show up all you  do is try and steal all the scenes. I swear, I've got  half a mind to kick your fat ass right out that door  onto the stage, you fat cow!""  Marilyn angrily brushed Mitzi's hand from her shoulder  and walked quickly to the dressing room door, locked it  and turned to face Mitzi with her hands on her hips.  ""All right Sweetie,"" she said in her bitchiest tone, ""If  you've come here to make a scene, you've accomplished  what you came for. Now, let's see if you're woman enough  to back up your words with some action. Let's settle  this between us girls once and for all.""   Mitzi suddenly looked concerned at the prospect of being  locked in a room with the angry blonde and she quickly  changed her tune, mumbling, ""Look, I... well, I didn't  really mean to make you mad... It's just that, well, I  wanted to get you moving. Come on, Marilyn, get on the  set and let's go to work.""  Mitzi started to edge toward the door, but Marilyn  snarled, ""Oh no, sweetheart, you're not getting off that  easy."" She shoved Mitzi back and the lithe dancer caught  her heel in the carpet and fell into Marilyn's chair.  Mitzi realized she'd pushed Marilyn too far and to hide  her fear she started acting cocky and sure of herself in  spite of her lack of cat fighting experience. The dancer  hoped that her physical conditioning, athletic skill and  a large dose of bravado would be enough to bluff her way  out of Marilyn's dressing room without suffering any  damage to either her body or her self-esteem.  Using brave words to hide her fear, ""If it's a fight you  want, you fat sow, then come on. I'll kick that fat ass  of yours into the middle of next week."" Marilyn had  heard that language before and she angrily started for  Mitzi, but the dancer lashed out, slapping her face and  Marilyn stopped in her tracks, surprised by the woman's  courage. Mitzi, herself surprised by her bravado,  quickly followed up with several more slaps to the  startled blonde's face.   Shocked by Mitzi's attack, Marilyn grabbed Mitzi's short  reddish hair and began to push her backwards. Mitzi  retaliated with two handfuls of Marilyn's blonde hair  and even added a couple of desperation kicks to the  actress' shins for good measure.  Marilyn was surprised by the speed and viciousness of  the inexperienced dancers attack, perhaps even hurt a  little as well. But Marilyn was an experienced cat  fighter and she knew where the fight would end by the  amateurish, ineffectual and weak way that Mitzi was  fighting.  Mitzi was shaken by Marilyn's thrust and she gasped in  surprise and, buoyed by her apparent early success,  broke into a smug grin. ""OK, if that's what you want you  blonde whore, I'm ready."" Mitzi unbuttoned her bolero  jacket and tossed it on the studio couch the studio  provided for their major stars. In her halter-top and  mid-thigh skirt, the auburn-haired dancer was an  impressive sight. Marilyn, her full figure exposed as  she unbelted and tossed away her robe, was a vision of  loveliness in her scandalous black underwear. ",©

t5_2uni5,Paladia,1362503238,"*It is always better to not have a problem than to mitigate it* © Carmack  There's only so much you can do with prediction, you cannot with any degree of accuracy predict if a person is about to press a button or not. What you can do, and what is being considered, is rendering a larger view than the fov and then when the user turns slightly shift what is being rendered directly. Despite that, latency is still an issue.  What you want is sub 20ms latency but current HMD, such as the latest one from Sony, are running at around 100ms latency. Even with a wire and using software technology only available in theory, you will get undesired latency.  It should also be noted that you can't compare a wireless controller with a wireless display device. A wireless controller at most sends out a few commands per second, it can be as low as a few bytes per second being transfered. However, the Rift (depending on resolution and hz of the consumer version) would have to receive from video alone an uncompressed 4:4:4 10 bit @ 1080p @ 60 fps = 475 MB/s. There are ways to decrease this number but it is still a massive amount of information that has to be transfered. And unlike a wireless control which mainly just sends information, the Rift would to both send and receive information at all times, due to the head tracking.  It can be done, but for now it is too costly and latency is an issue. If you want to go wireless, your best bet is to get a laptop backpack and possibly an external battery supply.",©

t5_2rz8w,GetDePantsed,1362506442,"Girl, I was you five years ago, even down to the height.  First, congrats and making some choices and getting some incentives.  Second, you really don't want to lose that much weight in three months.  Well, I mean you do, but there's a strong chance it won't last.  I read you're planning on cardio, diet and light weight training.  Excellent!  A few things about that:  1)  Don't be afraid of the weights.  As a female, you're not going to gain muscle mass the way the guys sometimes do.  Also, unless you're weight training hours a day, you're not going to gain so much muscle that you negate weight loss.  A lot of people have that fear and it's unreasonable.  Google can explain the science.  2)  Honestly, don't put so much rules around what you eat.  It complicates things.  Just watch your calories - but don't lie to yourself.  If you add too many rules, you'll get frustrated and just say the heck with it.  3)  Core work is a Good Thing™.  Crunches/situps, pushups, basic calisthenics and maybe some yoga.  A solid core makes the rest much easier.  4)  If you stick to this, you'll lose a good amount of weight quickly in the first month to six weeks.  Then it may taper down.  Sadly, that happens.  Good luck!",™

t5_2wenn,MHLoppy,1362512264,"Rioters often go into quite a lot of detail about what they're trying to achieve with changes in long trails of red posts on the forums. To date, every (notable) change that seemed dumb and counter-intuitive to me at first has had an explanation I found more than satisfactory by Xypherous or one of the other many Rioters that talk about stuff like this.  I don't know how much you've read about that sort of stuff and what Riot's general ""fun"" philosophy is, but to take 2 of your points:  &gt; Rengar  Riot has stated that if they believe that something is definitely overpowered and hurting the game, they would rather **over-nerf** that champion and then slowly build them back up to ""balanced."" A Rengar going around killing everything and never dying isn't fun to have in the game. A Rengar that is nerfed to being UP is *less* of an issue than CrazyRegnar™. Even in the most recent case of Blade of the Ruined King, Xypherous said (before the hotfix went out) that he wanted to **over-nerf** it and then again, bring it up to ""balanced."" (Whether what's out now is supposed to be slightly below par or not, I'm not sure. Stuff changes of course)  &gt; ""BC too strong"" -&gt; ""WA too strong"" -&gt; ""BOTRK too strong""  Xypherous went into some detail about this over multiple posts in the recent discussion threads about BOTRK. Ideally, they want to have a cycle of soft counters in WA (HP) -&gt; LW/BC (Armo(u)r negation) -&gt; RO/FH (Armo(u)r) -&gt; BOTRK/Scary Mask (anti-HP) -&gt; WA (HP). As evidenced by the state of the game in both solo queue and competitive play, HP was making the cycle get kind of stuck because the counterplay build wasn't sufficiently good at counterplaying the HP (but specifically BOTRK, not sure about his thoughts on Scary Mask).  Taking multiple factors into account, he made the decision to buff and tweak Blade of SliceThroughHP™ henceforth known as hotfixed blade. Most of the math done when that change came around indicated that it was ""WTF RIOT!?!?!?!?"". It became Jax's weapon. It became Caitlyn's cupcake.^^^nom It became Irelia's blades. It became Tristana's explosion. **Everyone and their support wanted a piece of this hotfixed blade.**  So right now you might be thinking ""GG Riot can't math because they meth instead wtf..."" This is where Xypherous comes in and explains what he had hoped to achieve and why the item needed to be released strong on paper (which it is still quite strong on paper currently) but then acknowledged it definitely got out of hand. He over-compensated for a few factors. Such as:  &gt; Fundamentally, any item built off of current health will always look overpowered when it works. This is because the optimal case for current health damage never actually happens in game.  &gt; For example, let's say that BoRK breaks even with BT at 1700 health for the target. What this actually means is that BoRK breaks even with BT at 1700 health for the target assuming there is no other damage sources affected the target at all.   &gt; Given that almost every character has base damage on their skills and the like - the balance of numbers shifts terribly - For example, if your mage deals 600 AoE damage to the enemy team - BoRK needs to be extra-efficient to still be a valid HP counter at this point.  &gt; This is also why the active is as strong as it is - The use of the active nerfs the passive damage of the item.  So you now see a cost efficient item + what looks like a really strong passive just for non-counter cases (counter being where that 4k HP Olaf/[insert tanky bruiser here] is being mean to you and you build hotfixed blade) The nidalee that threw a spear at Olaf for 500 damage just made your hotfixed blade's passive less effective. You decide you want to use the active to run the heck away from the now-very-angry-Olaf (who has a spear in his left eye I might add) and hotfixed blade's passive get worse. Your friendly junglourhood Jarvan decides to hit that angry Olaf with some damage, including his ult (helping you by trapping you in so you can commence some friendly diplomatic negotiations for a truce right?) and slaps that Olaf for 500 more damage with his passive + Q+E+R. Olaf's right shoulder is now missing, thanks to that friendly junglourhood Jarvan. You can thank him later. This is the part where your support Sona plays music for Olaf. This rips out both his ear drums for another 200 damage. You are now hitting a 2.5k HP Olaf (who is deaf, half blind, can't throw his Q without bleeding to death and more than slightly angry btw) before you even AA him. Thanks Obama.  While what was released to live was certainly compensated too far as noted previously (and by Xypherous) the soft counter to HP needed to look really strong on paper just to do its job in reality.",™

t5_2qhk3,Piroko,1362577362,"This.  OP, it's important to understand that feminism™ is merely a label.  It's word root is far too broad to have any useful meaning like socialism or egalitarianism.    Feminism™ in the west is a lot like National Socialism.    Socialism is good right?  And tacking national on to it, must make it even better, more patriotic.  Who isn't for nationalism?  But most of the world would agree that National Socialism was a bad influence and something we're much better for having stomped out.    The men's rights movement generally supports egalitarian ideals, and with that, we generally support women's rights to have abortions.  OP, when you look at r/mensrights and see us being opposed to feminism™, you have to realize that your country's feminist movement is not the same as ours.  Socialism vs National Socialism.    Feminism™, in the west, has become a brand name for institutionalized misandry and it must be destroyed (feminism™ delenda est).     Feminism™ is not like... say... Catholicism.  There is no international pope of feminism™ saying ""your interpretation is good, but your interpretation is heretical"".  Your country's movement probably has legitimate grievances that we would support in the name of egalitarianism.  All there is, is a word.

I'm not someone who needs to get up votes to justify my existence unlike you, who I see Obviously need em to survive. I just make comments on the ridiculous social outlooks of the very misguided masses that feed this stupidity, and really could t care less about up or downvotes. So cheers mate, and big ups to me for the votes. think they would almost be my firstWoohoo!!! Secondly, let me say, I'm not biased towards any type of music, I'm a fan of just about any form/type of music be it Instrumental, or electronic, including hiphop, so your comment on me being biased because of my views towards one particular style are completely misguided.  My views are based on many more factors than that.    Now while we're speaking of the stupidity of the misguided masses, lets get back to your comment about how could Kanye West have 15 Grammys if we wasn't a musical genius.  The sadly Misguided masses who are convinced by mainstream media and social media, and the fear of being an individual and making your own decisions, combined with the fact this imitation of real music is presented(sorry, forced upon)as the real thing, is only feeding the false ideas of what makes a true musician to the next generation.  That's the only reason this guy sells so much shite. Take away the millions and millions spent on Advertising this hack, and he would still be a backyard wannabe. It seems you can cover some guy in designer clothes, put him on a red carpet, get him to marry some other attention seeker, then convince the world he is it, and all the sheep will follow. These are basic principles of advertising, money and controversy can sell any shit to anyone, it's the mindless drones who are to afraid of being an individual who feel the need to like it to fit in that feed this problem. I can only imagine, if KW is presented to the young and impressionable as a comparison to someone like mozart now, what the fuck will we be listening to in the years to come.   People like him get billions for using other peoples music as samples, using computers with preloaded algorithms and auto tune, while others who train for years and years on an Instrument to hone there skills hardly get a look in is a complete and utter travesty!!!! Get out and listen to something that isn't on commercial radio or MTV, and you might get an idea of what REAL music and musicians sound like!!!   P. S its not all about KW, you can replace kw's name with Justin beiber, or any other of the talentless trash that fills our TVs or radios and the info still fits!!!",😄

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1362590025,"&gt; there are things like Pascal's Wager &gt; but that is trivially cut to pieces and shown to be errant.  Interesting, I wonder *how* ?  More interesting I consider ""What difference would it make?""  The only ""logical"" from this point of view I consider the ""agnostic"" view, and I was an agnostic for the most part of the life. Although I'm also a Bayesian (ref to my PhD from 2003: [""On Data Mining and Classification Using a a Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network ""](http://orre.neurologic.org/pubdoc/abstract/TRITA-NA-0308-abstract.html))  However, if you look upon a Bayesian probability model, when you collect samples of the world around you, then the updated probability distribution will change shape (like exemplified on page 19 for the first count, given different prior distributions).  Now you can not really pick samples of God, only indications about God.  The problem then is of course that you can not be certain about whether these indications are originating from some ""God"" or some (assumably) helper.  For my own I have always lived according the principles Jesus taught, and I consider it ridiculous that we should need laws (which today are so many and changes so often that people do not even know what is legal or not), but my basic ""belief"" was anyway agnostic. However, from age 32, 25 years ago, then I got my first indication, a kind of revelation, which I wrote about here: [""Revelation 24❣""](http://rolandorre.se/?m=201212&amp;paged=2) (the revelation 24 is somewhat playful as it tells about my revelation for my blog based ""advent calender"" for Dec 24 :-) but at the end of that entry I also reveal my revelation from 25 years back (OK, now almost 26) which resulted in a document, where I make a description of the world's technological and social advancements from 1987 to 2037. So far, during the last 25 years it has been extremely accurate. However, from 2012 to 2037 the description makes a ""jump"", and nowadays I also understand how to describe this ""jump"", that is the hyper exponential development, often denoted ""Singularity"" which will happen soon. The project I'm working on, which I got the idea to in year 2000, and patent applied 2004 (for protective reasons, when I had understood how to implement it) and was developing statistical and software methods for during my PhD program, sponsored by WHO (World Health Organisation), which I was engaged with until 2008. Since then I've been working on this project. On this page from Nov 17 [""Evolution, Deception and Cooking❢""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=175) I describe somewhat of the conditions that will change and also provide a nice graph of an hyper exponential function (from wikipedia) also denoted [Tetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration). A friend recently remarked that it may not be obvious for all why it gives rise to an hyper exponential, or merely why the first approach gives an exponential evolutionary process, but that is fairly trivial (combinatoric explosion) and I will soon describe that better.  Anyway the indications I've got over the years have convinced me that there is a God, but I can of course not tell what this God is.  Regarding Jesus, he has given us very particular and extremely accurate information on how to make societies work and how to build artificial intelligence. Therefore Jesus stands out as someone very special throughout history.  The principles with his ""Love Commandment"" gives us the key to design artificial intelligence, I published this principle on Christmas Eve in 2011, denoted [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15), which basically describes ""Love"" in a semi mathematical logical form, and explains why it is also a natural AI drive (it can also be generalized as the driving force behind anything, e.g. an evolutionary process, the universe etc, but I do not do that there).  The Love commandment also gives us the key to make societies work, it has been proven in simulation studies over and over that it is a concept that creates successful cooperative societies.  Regarding ""sharing"" which was exemplified with e.g. his ""the bread and the fishes"" this is the key to evolution. An evolutionary process, when the parts evolving can freely share information it has an exponential progress towards the ""optimum"" when no further evolution can happen under the constraints given.  This is the key to implement the ""Singularity"", which I anticapate will have reached a stable criterion, the next level, at 2037 (a type 1 society if we would use the denotation invented by Kardashevian).   Anyway, as I described on my ""Love as a Universal Concept"" I can not really see how a God belief would change anything. That would be irrational from my point of view.  To an atheist friend of facebook, who occasionally provides some advocating for atheism, I asked:  *As you claim something you don't know, which I do not. Then I'm still curios about why? The only logical explanation I can find, is that you actually know that we live in a simulation, and you know that certain religious zealots claim that moral and ethics requires religion, which of course is wrong (easy to prove), but this widespread religious rant, would have a disturbing effect upon the massively parallel evolutionary algorithm used for e.g. evolving artificial minds with certain properties.*  He didn't deny the answer :-)  PS. Edit: In June 2012 I provided a description of [""Meaning of Life: Condition 42""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=145). 42 is a number which has followed me the whole life, everywhere and was described by Douglas Adams as ""the answer"". On that blog I describe why it is the answer, and also provides the question(s). The question is relevant for advanced artificial beings in any type of world scenario.",❣

Some of them will eventually get curious enough to look into it on their own, and start to learn the truth. Others will run into one of us and it comes up in conversation, they ask, ""Like the comic book?"", and are genuinely receptive when you say, ""No, NOT AT ALL like the comic book.""

t5_2serw,tannersoap,1362602812,"""Cardinal Fever  With Major League Baseball's spring training games underway in the United States, it seemed appropriate to feature a project related to the sport.  Here's one submitted by Brandon Allen, who is a Saint Louis Cardinals fan.  Brandon created this sculpture for a local welding competition.  He invested almost 80 hours on the project; 6 hours on design and 71 hours on fabrication.  Brandon selected a Lincoln Electric Precision® TIG 225 TIG welder for the project.  He used the 225 to assemble the sculpture and to create the following details: the laces on the baseball, the feathers on the bird, and the wood grain finish on the bat.  According to Brandon, the most challenging part of the sculpture was the World Series Trophy.  The poles were made out of stainless steel filler metal, each with a specific length to give the trophy its distinctive look.  As the last step, the pennants were TIG welded to the flag poles.    The above project images and descriptions have been published to show how individuals used their ingenuity for their own needs, convenience and enjoyment. Only limited details are available and the projects have NOT been engineered by the Lincoln Electric Company. Therefore, when you use the ideas for projects of your own, you must develop your own details and plans and the safety and performance of your work is your responsibility. Got Projects?

t5_2qh5b,MeditationMcGyver,1362609337,"What you (and Travis) seem to be missing, is that gamma coherence is also seen, to a lesser extent, in long term TMers. However, the TM research methodology was so poor (even after all these years) they could not completely say that TM™ and/or the TM-Sidhi Program™ leads to this higher level of functioning, only that it appeared to adhere to the model.  It is these high levels of gamma coherence that some scientists (Stuart Hameroff and others) postulate a possible quantum phenomenon could be present, as these high frequencies do make it mathematically possible, while lower ones do not.  This effect also means that the brain can neuroplasticly ""rewire"" itself in the fastest way humanly possible. We're just beginning to understand how this occurs.  The latest research published in *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience* (Lazar, et al 2013) shows that refined unified consciousness begins as a top-down alpha rhythm modulation in somatosensory cortex enhances gain control which, in turn, sensitizes practitioners to better detect and regulate when the mind wanders from its somatic focus and thus achieve a spontaneously self-sustaining unitary state. This enhanced regulation of somatic mind-wandering may be an important early stage of mindfulness training that leads to enhanced cognitive regulation and metacognition.  Researchers further added that:  &gt;Our sensory-attentional cognitive theory of mindfulness practice proposes that a sequence of psychological abilities is achieved in mindfulness, including emotion perception, metacognition, and finally the release of attentional processes. The achievement of this sequence is thought to be at least partially dependent on improved top-down alpha modulation of gain control achieved by a somatically focused mindfulness practice.  &gt;This view of a sensory-attentional cognitive practice sequence is in line with the early Buddhist practice Sutra titled Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Analayo, 2004). The Sutra specifies “Mindfulness of the Body” and “Mindfulness of the Breath” as beginners' practices that are thought to enable subsequent gains in “Mindfulness of Feelings” and “Mindfulness of Thoughts.” Working through the sequence from mindfulness of the body to mindfulness of thoughts is believed to enable the ability to be both present and non-reactive to one's internal experiences, such as negative cognitions and strong negative emotions.   **Mindfulness starts with the body: somatosensory attention and top-down modulation of cortical alpha rhythms in mindfulness meditation** Catherine E.

I lost my virginity when I was 20... 1 week before 21st birthday.  GOD I HATED BEING A VIRGIN.  It was so fucking stressful! I worried about it constantly! I felt inadequate... worthless, a loser, a failure, a fraud...  Check this out:  The day after you lose your virginity, YOU WILL LAUGH AT WHAT YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN.  You will think to yourself, ""that's it? that's what I've spent half my life stressing out over?""  Because it's not a big deal at all. Really, it's not. Realize that you attach so much of yourself to the idea of ""sex"" not because of YOU, but because of what you've been told your entire life!  Sex has been used to SELL TO YOU over and over and over again! CONSTANTLY. You've been brainwashed to think that sex is the reason for your very existence!  Now, we could argue that it may be true on a strictly biological level, but we're not talking biological... we're talking SOCIAL. You have anxiety due to how society has molded your thoughts on sex.  Don't worry – we've all fallen into this trap!  Why is this important? Because people have different lives. There is no set age to lose your virginity... let this change your frame real quick:  You know how you've lied about your virginity? I DID THE EXACT SAME SHIT. I also lied about having never kissed a girl, cause I didn't do that until I was 20 also!  You think you are so much different from everyone else? There are MANY, MANY people who have ALSO LIED ABOUT THEIR OWN SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.  You think it's you against the world on this one... it's not! More people lose their virginity later in life than you would believe.  It's natural. It's okay. No problem! YOU ARE NOT YOUR GOD DAMNED VIRGINITY!  About your anxiety—  This one is tough. Not because it's tough, but because you're so used to thinking a certain way that you've brainwashed yourself into believing it's THE TRUTH™.  Your first time may be a bit tough. Mine was. In fact, my first time was—by far—the most awkward experience I've ever had in my life.  Oh god! Scary!  NO. FUCK NO.  I'm so fucking happy I had that awkward of a first time! It's fucking hilarious! I tell that story all the time. ""...just don't make me tell you the story of when I lost my virginity!""  It's awesome. Not only that, but I fucking raped my comfort zone and recovered from it. The next day. Easily.  *Not only that, but since I've lived through that bullshit, I can comfort suckers like you! ;) ;)*  Here's the trap you're gonna want to avoid falling into, let me warn you now:  Once you have sex, you may become ""attached"" to the girl, but in a different way than you think. You probably won't fall head over heels in love. I didn't. HOWEVER, you'll be ""comfort zone"" attached. Because even after you've had sex once, it doesn't make you a pro. Your head will tell you, ""just stay with her, she knows my situation already, I can learn with her"".   And maybe you can. But be aware of this also – your first time with any girl is, to some very slight degree, losing your virginity again. This is why you don't need to worry about being bad! Because SEX IS SOMETIMES AWKWARD.  What's the difference between a virgin and someone who's experienced? HOW THEY HANDLE THE AWKWARDNESS.  So if you fuck up and it destroys your soul, it becomes a big deal (because you make it). However, you could easily fuck up and act like nothing's wrong and it's all normal, and she'll just go along!  **In fact, GOOD SEX is NOT ABOUT TECHNIQUE... IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU HANDLE THE AWKWARDNESS!**  Sex is different for everyone! Even if you're fucking god awful and start fucking her left knee, how the hell would she know that you haven't done that with 20 other girls? Maybe *she's* the inexperienced one! ;)  Now, here's how you lose your fucking virginity, THIS YEAR (or this month):  1) **DECIDE TO.**  This is, HANDS DOWN, the most important step. For me, I had always set new year's resolutions... ""I'll lose my virginity this year!"" But I didn't DECIDE FOR SURE that it would happen... so it never did!  The year I lost my virginity, I said this to myself:  I WILL LOSE MY FUCKING VIRGINITY THIS YEAR EVEN IF I HAVE TO GO TO AMSTERDAM AND GET A PROSTITUTE.  I meant every fucking word of it. I didn't care if I had to spend my entire life savings to do it. I would lose my virginity that year.  Guess what happened? Within two months, I'd lost my virginity... for free (minus one pizza!).  When you full commit to something, magic happens... you get what you want very easily! Don't worry about failure. GUARANTEE your success by being willing to pay to lose your virginity. You probably won't have to. And even if you do, who gives a fuck? Much better than living your life stressing out over something that—as you will soon find out—is very normal and overhyped by the media (not to take anything away from the act!).  So decide to do it. AND MEAN IT.  2) **STOP LOOKING AT PORN**  It's killing your motivation, sex drive, and your ability to view sex as natural and normal.  No, I'm not preaching here. It's true. Because as you'll soon find out, sex is a very REAL experience. It's RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Porn is very, very, very, very, very far away. And it divorces the orgasm from EVERY SINGLE OTHER ASPECT OF SEX.  Therefore, watching porn consistently will show your brain that sex is ONE THING, when in reality, it's SO MUCH MORE.  Once you've had sex, you'll easily see what I'm talking about, and you might decide to start looking at porn again. No problem! You'll know the difference. At this point, you don't know the difference, so stop training your body to orgasm based on something that isn't real!  *This upcoming stuff is just if you have trouble bringing women into your life. If not, it's unnecessary!*  2.5) **STOP MASTURBATING**  This is optional. However, stopping masturbating is a great way to bring women into your life. I don't really know the details, but it does make you feel more energized (although effects can be temporary).  The main reason for this is to constantly remind yourself of your DECISION. No, you're not ""saving your sperm"". You're proving to yourself that you actually want what you say you want. As a result, it will very likely speed up the entire process.  This being said, I would actually recommend masturbating once every seven days. I hesitate to recommend this because most guys can't control themselves to this level, but if you can, then do this.  Why? Because masturbating will tell your body you're regularly having sex, which will keep your sex drive up. Doesn't make a huge difference, and like I said, take this step with a grain of salt.  But if you do masturbate, DON'T DO IT TO PORN AND DON'T FANTASIZE ABOUT FICTIONAL SCENARIOS, for reasons I've already outlined.  3) **GO TO THE GYM**  Oh lawdy... so, so, so, so, so many people on this website complain about never finding a suitable mate, yet they never go to the god damn gym! Going to the gym is SO IMPORTANT, on so many levels!  Go to the gym for 6 months and tell me you don't have dramatically increased interest from women. Everything works better when you work out. EVERYTHING. Plus your testosterone increases.  3.6/8's) **Wear a well fitting white tee and blue jeans every single day of the week.**  You just can't go wrong with this outfit.  –  Anyways man, I really hope this helps. Remember, it's not a big deal. And even though you'll probably continue to tell yourself it's a big deal, once you have sex (which you will—trust me—you won't die a virgin like you fear!), you'll just laugh at yourself and society for how hyped up such a natural and REAL thing is.  Enjoy this time, while you're learning how to get what you truly want! These lessons will pay off HUGE in the future.  Good luck!   *(although you don't need it)*  ",™

t5_2s4tv,mmainsurgent,1362622289,"  Reply to letter from ex-DCI James Woolsey re: 1993 Briefing   23 September 1999  Tonight I was asked by the editor of a small UFO newsletter (CNI News) to comment on a recent letter signed by former CIA Director R. James Woolsey et al regarding my meeting with him on December 13,1993. Apparently, this letter was sent to Michael Lindemann for publication in the September 30 edition of the CNI newsletter.  Mr. Woolsey and the others question the accuracy (or manners) of my depiction of this meeting in the introduction of my new book ""Extraterrestrial Intelligence: The Evidence and Implications"". You can read this introduction on the website for yourself.  Mr. Woolsey et al have a very selective memory of this nearly 3 hour briefing of a sitting CIA Director. If anything, and my wife who was present can attest to this, my description of the meeting is incredibly understated.  In his letter, Mr. Woolsey (now apparently a lobbyist in Washington) implies that this was not a briefing but only a dinner party, and that the dinner party was not a cover story for the briefing, etc.  It must be understood that it was a friend of the CIA Director, Mr. Petersen - not myself - who characterized the dinner party as a cover story for the meeting with the CIA Director. Indeed, Mr. Petersen made the arrangements for this meeting and hosted it at his home in Arlington VA . He told me and my wife that even his wife did not know Mr. Woolsey was coming to their home for dinner until the morning of the briefing.  They claim my characterization and specific references describing the meeting were inaccurate. Not at all.  Quoting from a sensitive memo FedEx'ed to my home from Mr. Petersen, who made all of the arrangements with the CIA Director:  ""I talked to Woolsey this morning and he (underlined in the original) suggested getting together over dinner. He was not aware of your organization or that anyone was planning such an announcement {regarding UFOs}. This almost certainly means that,      there is an active attempt being made at lower levels of government to sabotage Project Starlight {the CSETI UFO disclosure effort},     this group almost certainly has tapped your phones and is aware of most of the details of your plans...""  ""If we do have dinner with Jim (Woolsey), we will have moved this whole thing to a much, much higher plane and in doing so raised significant red flags for those who don't want to see this succeed. Operation Starlight will become a serious (underlined) threat to the status quo.""  ""Meetings with people like Woolsey must be kept very closely guarded. I have not even told Diane {Mr. Petersen's wife/smg} about it.""  ""You must understand that great principalities and powers will oppose your plans...""  Then, all in bold: ""Remember: the most powerful people in the world will have a deep, compelling interest in our activities and will use everything (in italics) at their disposal to effect their objectives.""  And so forth.  Mr. Petersen, who heads up a national security think tank called The Arlington Institute, was working very closely with me during those days and had substantial experience in national security and military matters.  From the above quotes it is obvious that this was no mere dinner party! The dinner party was only the cover - and the stakes were and are every bit what Mr. Petersen describes.  As for other information contested in Mr. Woolsey's letter, I stand by the account. Regarding Mr. Woolsey's UFO sighting : This was first conveyed to me by his long-time friend Mr. Petersen and was later confirmed at the briefing.  In my new book, I reproduce the document handed to Mr. Woolsey during the briefing. In this document, which I handed personally to him, we recommend that Mr. Woolsey and the President move decisively towards a near-term disclosure of the UFO/ETI matter. Just a dinner party?  I am certain that Mr. Woolsey knew the UFOs were real and that a very deep cover project was running that area - a project which had kept the CIA Director himself in the dark.  Later in their letter, Mr. Woolsey et al complain that my conduct ""contravenes ....simple manners"". Manners? I was on Larry King Live over 9 months after the meeting with the CIA Director. But this meeting was not disclosed, because Mr. Woolsey was still in office and I felt decorum necessitated silence regarding such meetings. I have behaved with the utmost restraint and have disclosed such matters only after very careful consideration. Indeed, I would not be writing this letter except that Lindemann at CNI plans to publish Mr. Woolsey's 'sanitized ' account of the briefing and has compelled me to write. (Why Mr. Woolsey et al would make such a letter available to Lindemann is beyond me.) I made no pact of silence regarding such meetings. And since disclosing this meeting, I have always portrayed Mr. Woolsey and his wife as people seeking the truth of such matters and as people who wanted excessive secrecy ended. Perhaps I was wrong...  Manners? Indeed - if anything, perhaps I have been too restrained.  Good  'manners' as it pertains to this subject means speaking the truth - and being willing to stand up for it. Good manners would be public servants such as Mr. Woolsey, Dr. Woolsey and others doing the right thing and working ardently for the truth to be told regarding UFOs and ETI. Good manners should mean being more concerned for the health of our democracy and the Constitution than covering-up the import and purpose of such a briefing. And good manners would be joining in the effort to disclose a matter which, once made public, would allow earth-saving technologies to be revealed which would halt the wholesale destruction of our eco-system.  As a very busy emergency doctor in NC, with 4 young daughters, I assure you that we did not make that brief trip to Washington DC on December 13, 1993 to sight-see or just to have dinner. But rather, we made that journey to plead for the end of super-secret projects which are being withheld from the people so that our democracy could be made whole and our children's future made sustainable.  The current attempt to minimize, obfuscate or cover-up the purpose and details of this briefing with the CIA Director is quite disconcerting - and strange. Why Mr. Woolsey and the others would write such a letter is unknown to me. We can only speculate. I stand by my account. But now, perhaps the time has come for ''we the people' to demand that current and former officials such as CIA Director Woolsey and the President be held responsible for the the lack of action on resolving this most pressing problem. After all, we pay their salaries, provide their perks - and they represent us. It is not I who needs defense. My actions over these long years have spoken my commitment. But we still await action from our elected and appointed officials. As the earth groans under the weight of the errosive and corrupting influences of big money and special interests, I wonder just how much longer we shall have to wait...  I think it is time that the American people demand that the waiting time be over.  Steven M.

t5_2qh16,TheFunDontStop,1362626426,"lol no. please don't waste your own time taking these delusional paranoid fantasies seriously, the admins have nothing to do with srs as long as they don't break any site rules.  [just go look at it for yourself](/r/shitredditsays). it's a subreddit that posts examples of upvoted, bigoted comments on reddit. there are also a bunch of smaller subreddits you can find in the sidebar with different focuses, either social justice/oppression-related (srsgsm, srsdisabilities), or just other shit (srsgaming, srsmusic). all together, they're technically called the 'fempire', although redditors often conflate srs the circlejerk subreddit with srs the collection of a whole bunch of subreddits.  there are a couple reasons redditors hate srs so much:  1) srs tells them that shit like their ""op is a f****t"" jokes is actually bigoted and harmful, and that they (redditors) aren't as progressive as they think they are. they don't like that because it challenges their worldview and their self-image as progressive liberals.  2) srs (the main subreddit, not the affiliate ones) is designed as a circlejerk, in the sense that disagreement = banned. the other subreddits aren't quite as strict, but they still have quite a bit of moderation compared to most of reddit's hands-off moderation style. this offends redditors because of their obsession with **free speech™**. they also really don't like people who like/talk about things they don't like - see hatred of casual gamers, people who watch what they consider shitty movies/tv shows, etc.  3) srs has in the past drawn media attention to creepy subreddits like /r/jailbait and /r/creepshots and helped put pressure on the site to shut them down. redditors really liked their jailbait and creepshots (blech).  and then some variations on those reason. seriously, which do you think is more likely - srs is the secret police of reddit, sanctioned by the admins to make the site look terrible? or it's just a subreddit that calls redditors out for being immature bigoted children, and so redditors hate it? occam's razor.  edit: the reason this crazy misinformation spreads is i think mostly because of threads like this. reddit becomes this echo chamber of anti-srs thought, because anyone who tries to post simple, accurate information will get downvoted to hell because they're thought to be from srs (whether they are or not. i obviously am, looking at my post history, so clearly i am **biased** and **irrational** and can't be trusted!). one person hears a story, then they repeat it, and it gets a little more crazy each time until eventually srs is this larger-than-life bogeyman that is secretly in control of all of reddit. take a step back from it, and it's clearly ridiculous.",™

They specifically say to ONLY fire 3"" shells in a Magnum rated receiver.  Try that with an older vintage Wingmaster receiver that is only rated for 2-3/4"", and sooner or later, you will get a once in a lifetime treat of overpressure and it's effect on fractured metal shards.  EDIT: (Bolding is mine to highlight the most essential caution from the manufacturer.) &gt;Remington® 870 Replacement Shotgun Barrels  &gt;Model 870 Barrels with 3"" chambers will fit both magnum and 2-3/4"" receivers and will handle both 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells with a magnum receiver. (An M at the end of the serial number = magnum receiver.) **Use only 2-3/4"" shells when barrels are used on 2-3/4"" receivers.** 870 Special Field barrels and other model 870 barrels are not interchangeable. The 20-ga. lightweight barrels will not fit 20-ga. standard guns. Light contour barrels for the 870 Wingmaster have a weight reduction of more than a 1/2 lb. to improve balance, portability and handling without sacrificing strength or durability.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1362639188,"&gt;This was before God directly set morality correct by sending Christ.   Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  &gt;This was taken out of context. Before this verse, the Lord commanded that the Jews mark all civilians who feared God  Genocide with a pathetically thin justification is still genocide, sweatheart. ",™

t5_2ssl0,Ormusn2o,1362644612,"Ah finnaly thread specialy designed for me. Let me start. Titles in order of lewdness.  1. Bakemonogatari/nisemonogatari. It's high class fanservice anime. Bear in mind it has good plot and 95% of anime is talking. But i love fanservice here, specialy in nisemonogatari.  2. Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai. It seems like nobody knows about existence of this anime. People say this is like new Highshool DxD but i could not watch H DxD and i enjoyed this series. MC is likeable and one of the girls is a redhead ♥.  3. IS: Infinite Stratos. If you are looking for fanservice without commitment this is anime for you. No unnesesary plot, no unnesesary scenes. Pure ecchi.  4. Highschool of the Dead. This anime... It's so low on the list of lewdness because it pretends this is not pure fanservice show. So fanservice have less impact on me. But it's still great anime and boobs physics is best i evers saw in anime.  5. Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! Highpoint of this anime would by IMO animation. I loved how characters move. There is not much fanservice but when there is it's intensive.   6. B Gata H Kei. There is 12 episode anime and 300 chapters manga. Not quite fanservice show and most of lewdness comes from dirty jokes but i love it. Anime is good and manga is marvelous. It's like funniest anime i ever saw.  I think this is it. Rest of my suggestion does not have fanservice every episode so this ends my list.",♥

t5_2qioo,Riddla26,1362680121,"To focus on the graphics card example a bit more:  A giant difference is laptop vs desktop. A laptop has extremely limited space, smaller chipsets and less power to give to those chipsets.  Desktop cards can typically hog 2 blanking plate slots in a machine and require an extra 12 or so pins to power (6+8 pin adaptors from the PSU.) As part of this they have hulking great coolers on them and can run at higher clock speeds, contain more video RAM and all that other stuff.  There's not really one thing it comes down to, but using your specs as an example:  512Mb video RAM is, really, a bit small these days. The majority of graphics cards are using 1.5Gb and above, with some cards even carrying a full 3Gb. The amount of memory determines how large (and therefore, how detailed) the textures etc are that can be loaded into the memory in once instance.  Pixel shader 4.0 is the name for a specific technology that some game engines, such as the Unreal engine, take advantage of. It's marginally important at best. If your card is good enough to play a game that supports it, it will also support PS4.0.  Vertex shader is much the same thing.  According to the spec sheet for your laptop, the T410 has either an integrated (read: pretty poor) Intel HD Graphics chipset. The HD 4000 series is fairly alright, able to run some newer games at low or medium graphics. If not that then a 256MB NVIDIA® Quadro® NVS3100M. Quoting from [notebookcheck.net](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-Quadro-NVS-3100M.24738.0.html): The Nvidia NVS 3100M or Nvidia Quadro NVS 3100M is a business graphics card that is based on the GT218 core (e.g. GeForce G210M / 310M) but with drivers that are optimized for stability and compatibility in business applications).  Therefore, it is an entry level graphics card with low 3D performance that should be sufficient for low end games and demanding games in very low detail settings and resolutions. For example the old FEAR ran on a G210M in medium to high details fluently. Still, because of the ""business drivers"" and the slightly lower clock rate, the gaming performance of the NVS3100M may be worse.  [Looking at their chart for laptop graphics](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Comparison-of-Laptop-Graphics-Cards.130.0.html) you can see that there are lots of newer and faster laptop cards available, though unfortunately pretty much all of these are less powerful than their desktop based counterparts.  Bringing this back to why you can't run games, the games may require at least a certain revision of a chipset (at least a GTX400 series for example) or it may be that your card simply doesn't have the horsepower to run the game engine.  If you really want to game and have some cash to put into the hobby, hop on over to /r/buildapc and they'll be more than happy to help you figure out which bits you need. If you really have no clue where to start (or no desire to learn) then try /r/buildapcforme instead. If you're insistent on a laptop, try /r/suggestalaptop.  I hope this helps, if you have any follow up questions please feel free to ask.  Tl;dr - Your laptop graphics card sucks. Read the rest to find out why. :)",®

[ACLU Sued Barela and Dona Ana in 2010 for mistreating those with mental disabilities](http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/civil-rights-groups-sue-dona-ana-county-jail-over-poor-mental-health-services)  You know when someone screws up that badly and isn't fired there is usually a ""follow the money"" trail. So lets start with the people responsible for health care at the facility ...   the Nursing is outsourced to a private company [Contracted vendor Corizon Health (formerly Prison Health Services), as of January 2008, provides 24/7 primary and urgent care and mental health services for inmates ... More than 50% of the jail population is on some form of medication related to their mental health status.](http://nmhealth.org/phd/dist3/detention.htm). So the main incentive for a private health care company is money, if you put more people on drugs you get more money from taxpayers. More people drugged out of their mind to the point of stupor means less work for people, lower staffing, Profit.   Now let's look at the administrative portion. Hmm. Also outsourced:  Quoting: Outsourcing to Aramark [Dona Ana Streamlines Operations  ... To provide administrative efficiencies in accepting deposits into inmate trust funds and providing commissary services to those incarcerated, ACS’ technology-based solutions: iCare™, Go-Cart™ and TouchPay™ went live at the 900-bed facility.  Dona Ana officials anticipate the programs will free up time for the correctional officers and allow them to focus on maintaining public safety and security](http://www.aramark.com/PressRoom/PressReleases/Dona-Ana-County-Detention-Center.aspx)  How about the facility as a whole? Hard to tell as prison for profit companies have in recent years tried to get no publicity for taking over centers and some centers pay their directors/sheriffs more the more money they make. In this case [it looks like Dona Ana Country Detention Center is a private company?](http://start.cortera.com/company/research/k5s3sso9k/dona-ana-county-detention-center/), but I've run out of time for investigation.

t5_2qh3l,highguy420,1362691478,"Bitcoin is not just an investment.  It is a currency.  I'm laughing my ass off at PayPal® investors, but I understand why their users use the service.  Take note I'm talking about two different groups of people here.  Hoarding is not healthy for bitcoin, so you and I agree.  Those treating bitcoin like a new market to exploit are being greedy and shortsighted.  Bitcoin will have its ups and downs, but as a globally accessible distributed currency it, or the idea of it anyway, is here to stay.   You laughing at ""bitcoin investors"" is like laughing at ""bittorrent investors"" (I'm purposely misusing the term ""investors"" to mean ""users"" as you have to drive home the point).  Bittorrent is here to stay and is being incorporated in content distribution for legitimate software, and even commercial content distribution systems for IPTV set-top boxes.  Some people use bittorrent for things that are destructive, others use it for positive things, the point is that even if the ""official"" bittorrent client is no longer produced, or in this case bitcoin is abandoned, the idea and the technology have changed the way we as humans perceive money itself.

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1362698763,"[Article Images](http://imgur.com/a/lm9Ts)  &gt;###Developer Update: Overview of the Planet Makeb - 03.07.2013  &gt;Hello everyone! I’m Charles Boyd, Lead Writer on Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, here to shed a bit of light on how the BioWare Austin team initially conceived of the planet in the Digital Expansion: Rise of the Hutt Cartel. Known as Makeb, this world is an entirely new addition to the Star Wars™ galaxy, and we’re very excited for you to experience it in the Digital Expansion!  &gt;When our team sets out to add a new planet to The Old Republic, we always start by examining things from the player perspective. What sort of environment can we create that will feel new and unique? How can we give players a new or different view of the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire and its effects on the galaxy? What kind of themes can we explore that we haven’t seen before?  &gt;###Disaster World  &gt;Early on, we seized on the idea of a beautiful planet that’s being ravaged by ecological disasters. A place that would normally seem serene and welcoming, transformed into an environment that feels like it could fall out from under you at any second. With that goal in mind, we designed the entire planet to support the “disaster world” experience.  &gt;All of Makeb’s livable space is located on top of massive, towering stone mesas. This gives it a unique geography compared to our existing planets and provides for some breathtaking views, but it also begins to feel very precarious when a series of devastating “groundquakes” begin to strike. These beautiful stone mesas start to feel like death traps, constantly on the verge of collapsing into the seemingly-bottomless mists below. Entire cities are split in half, with massive fault lines torn directly across streets and through buildings.  &gt;But of course, having an entire world that seems bent on destroying the player isn’t nearly enough of a challenge…  &gt;###Hutt Hostilities   &gt;When the writers discussed who the Players’ direct opposition should be on Makeb, the choice was unanimous: we all wanted to fight the Hutts. The increasing aggression of the Hutt Cartel was introduced in our Game Update (Operation: Karagga’s Palace Part II), and we wanted to bring that looming conflict to the forefront on Makeb and give players a chance to face-off with the Cartel once and for all.  &gt;The Hutts give us an opportunity to reinforce just how fragile the balance of power has become due to the ongoing war between the Republic and the Empire. The entire galaxy seems like it’s up for grabs at this point, and it was only a matter of time before a wealthy and powerful entity like the Hutts decided to make their own bid for control.  &gt;So, why has the Cartel decided to start their rise to power by seizing control of Makeb? That’d be giving too much away…  &gt;###Ascendance and Resurgence   &gt;The situation on Makeb sees the Republic and the Empire exploring some new ground as well. For the first time in decades, the Republic is in a position of superiority. Their forces are finally pushing the Empire back. The writing team was eager to explore how this newly advantageous position might affect the Republic’s decision-making. Their leaders would obviously be eager to keep the momentum going and drive toward ultimate victory, so Makeb’s request for aid presents a quandary. While it’s obviously important to stop the Hutts before they can become more of a threat than they already are, it’s also important not to lose sight of the big picture. Can the people of Makeb make up for the risk that their rescue presents to the outcome of the entire war? How are the Republic’s values tested when they’re the ones in the lead?  &gt;Obviously, this leaves the Empire in the opposite position. There are very few living Imperials who are accustomed to failure, and exploring how this society might adjust in order to survive their embattled situation was something the writers really enjoyed. But while things certainly aren’t easy in Imperial space, they shouldn’t be counted out yet. The Imperials have learned exactly why the Hutts are making their play on Makeb, and if their forces can move with enough speed and guile, the Empire may be able to seize that same opportunity for themselves.  &gt;###More to Come!  &gt;We’ll be pulling back the curtains on Makeb even more in the weeks ahead, so stay tuned, and thanks for reading! On behalf of everyone involved in developing this strange new world, we hope you all enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed creating it!  &gt;Charles Boyd Star Wars: The Old Republic Lead Writer",™

And everyone went up to that teacher in the middle of the year and told her how much she treats those suck ups. She gets mad and says how dare you all for saying something like that to me. Then my friend goes and tells her how come when ever she tells us to sit down and stop crowding her they get to stand around her all day. She gets mad again and tells us to sit down. The truth hurts doesn't it. This is a true story. 😓 Unfortunately ,😓

Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.  -	MAGPUL BAD LEVER   o	Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.  o	Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.   -	MAGPUL MS2 SLING   -	VLTOR QD SLING SWIVEL   -	STRIKE INDUSTRIES TRIGGER GUARD     *****UPPER*****    -	BCM UPPER &amp; BCM BFH 16” BARREL   o	Cold hammer forged  o	M4 Feed ramp barrel extension  o	USGI 1/7 twist rate  o	Mil-Spec barrel steel (Mil-B-11595E)  o	Chrome bore and chamber  o	Manganese phosphate barrel finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267)  o	5.56 NATO Chambers  o	Government barrel profile  o	HPT (High Pressure Test)   o	MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected)   -	MIDWEST INDUSTRIES SS12G2 FREE FLOAT RAIL   o	Super slim 1.5 inch diameter  o	9.3 oz  o	Modular design, 3 2.5 inch rail sections, including anti-rotation QD socket  o	MIL-STD 1913 top rail  o	T-marked  o	6061 aluminum alloy   -	BCM BOLT CARRIER GROUP   o	Milspec Carpenter No. 158® steel  o	HPT Bolt (High Pressure Tested/ Proof)  o	MPI Bolt (Magnetic Particle Inspected)  o	Shot Peened Bolt  o	Chrome Lined Carrier (AUTO)  o	Chrome Lined Gas Key  o	Gas Key Hardened to USGI Specifications  o	Grade 8 Hardened Fasteners  o	Key Staked Per Mil-Spec  o	Tool Steel Extractor  o	BCM Extractor Spring  o	Black Extractor Insert  o	Mil-Spec Crane O-Ring   -	MAGPUL AFG2 FOREGRIP   o	The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.  o	Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.   -	VLTOR BCM MOD 4 CHARGING HANDLE   o	Extended latch system  o	Machined From 7075 T6 billet  o	MIL-A-8625F type III Class 2 Hardcoat anodized finish  o	MOD4 Medium Latch     *****OPTICS*****   -	AIMPOINT MICRO T-1 2MOA (on order)  -	LARUE TACTICAL 1/3 CO-WITNESS LT660 MOUNT (on order)  -	MAGPUL GEN2 MBUS FRONT &amp; REAR SIGHT  ",®

t5_2snuc,gnomicarchitecture,1362714434,"&gt;That's not a causal relationship. You could remove the iff and use if, but you didn't do that.  Huh? That's commonly how causal relations are cashed out, e.g.:  For all x,y: C(x,y) ↔ ~Ox→~Oy.   The thing on the left of the biconditional is called a ""counterfactual"". Stimula are not the relata of causal relations. Events are the relata of causal relations. Also, this definition entails that the only causal relations are ones which can be ""shown"". There's also this notion of a ""logical path"". I have no idea what this means. Here's something causing something else:  John's kicking the ball causes the ball's motion to the north.   Here the event [john's kicking the ball] causes another event [the ball's motion to the north]. What a ""logical path"" is supposed to be here I don't know, but I do know that if it was false that John had kicked the ball, it would be false that the ball moved north. Indeed, whenever some event is such that if it didn't happen, another event wouldn't have happened, it is the cause of that other event.   Nevertheless, we can use your notion of causation if you want, and then it seems clear that we can have the mental state M causing the other mental states, the motion of john to get water etc. How? Well we can show that the relations between electrons which make up the state M can cause (via physical laws and antecedent conditions) the relations between electrons that generate mental state M1, further, they can also cause John's moving his legs (via neurophysiological signals from John's brain to his legs). E.g. moving his legs in the direction of water. ",↔

t5_2s3qj,licnep1,1362714854,"In this case yes. But the problem of money laundering is certainly not specific to politics.   It's about being able to follow the money trail, seize riches obtained illegally, convict more criminals,.  If a mafia guy gets paid a lot to do mafia stuff (threatening and killing people, burning properties, stealing etc.) it would be nice to be able to prove where all that money went afterwards so it can be seized. With a system like send shared™ they can just open a facade store, get all the money through send shared™ and pretend it came from lawful activities. There would be no way to prove where the money comes from. People would be buying villas and yacht at the expense of good people. There's a reason why this shit is illegal everywhere.   Bitcoin can go either way, it can either be used to promote transparency of transactions, or do the opposite. I think the former is a great opportunity. Say an exchange gets hacked. We can all see the address/es where the bitcoins are sent, and the network as a whole could choose to stop accepting transactions from that address or even force a transaction from the thief's wallet back to the exchange (and its users).

I used to roll with Grooveshark for a while until I wanted to listen to freshly released or rare music. Only then did I discover Grooveshark to be full of incomplete albums, wrong tags, a confusion of multiple versions of albums, live recordings where there should only be studio songs - in short, *a floating madhouse*™. So I ditched Grooveshark, went with [Reddit Playlister](http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/) and [Tubalr](http://www.tubalr.com) for a while.  I actually suggested involving the Discogs API to Tubalr! (which by the way is how you design an interface - especially for people with netbooks who have small screens).  TL;DR: Push the Discogs API to the front moar, and there will be orderliness in the Universe. If you build it they will come.",™

t5_2qh0u,jesstrioxin,1362744596,"Which is correct as the plural of LEGO: 'Lego' or 'Legos'? Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).   *quick copy and paste from google.. but who really gives a shit..

t5_2r9vp,fisherthephish,1362771329,"There's trouble on the streets tonight, I can feel it in my bones. I had a premonition, That he should not go alone. I knew the gun was loaded, But I didn't think he'd kill. Everything exploded, And the blood began to spill. So baby, here's your ticket, Put the suitcase in your hand. Here's a little money now, Do it just the way we planned. You be cool for twenty hours And I'll pay you twenty grand. I'm sorry it went down like this, And someone had to lose, It's the nature of the business, It's the smuggler's blues. Smuggler's Blues  The sailors and pilots, The soldiers and the law, The pay offs and the rip offs, And the things nobody saw. No matter if it's heroin, cocaine, or hash, You've got to carry weapons Cause you always carry cash. There's lots of shady characters, Lots of dirty deals. Ev'ry name's an alias In case somebody squeals. It's the lure of easy money, It's gotta very strong appeal.  Perhaps you'd understand it better Standin' in my shoes, It's the ultimate enticement, It's the smuggler's blues, Smuggler's blues.  See it in the headlines, You hear it ev'ry day. They say they're gonna stop it, But it doesn't go away. They move it through Miami, sell it in L.A., They hide it up in Telluride, I mean it's here to stay. It's propping up the governments in Colombia and Peru, You ask any D.E.A. man, He'll say There's nothin' we can do, From the office of the President, Right down to me and you, me and you.  It's a losing proposition, But one you can't refuse. It's the politics of contraband, It's the smuggler's blues, Smuggler's blues.  -Writer: FREY, GLENN LEWIS / TEMPCHIN, JACK Lyrics © Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., Don Henly/Glenn Frey/Eagles",©

t5_2sgq6,dance4days,1362790947,"&gt;Self interpretation is far more worthless. The Creators intent is more valuable then you are willing to give credit for.   Here, read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent) and learn a little bit about what it is you're talking about. If you care enough to learn even more, read [this](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/barthes.death.pdf) and [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor).  &gt;Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex.[1] For there to be sexism there has to be sexes. Sprites are made of pixels and pixels do not meet any form of sentient life further more.  &gt;Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). Most female mammals, including human females, have two X chromosomes. Once again pixel don't have two X chromosomes. So there are no females in videos games nor are sprites organism   This is, without a doubt, the stupidest attempt to handwave this video series away that I've read, and that's really saying something given the amount of bullshit I've read from butthurt dudes since it was announced. Do you also think sexism is impossible in literature and animation?",♀

t5_22i0,archibald_tuttle,1362822291,"&gt;Ist eine Drohne nichts anderes als ein Flieger bei dem der Pilot nicht im Gerät sondern irgendwo im Trockenen sitzt? Und der deswegen billiger produziert werden und schneller und besser fliegen kann?  So halb. Aktuelle Drohnen fliegen halbautonom, d.h. die Piloten geben z.B. Wegpunkte auf einer Karte vor und die Drohne fliegt dann von selbst dorthin. Der Grund ist dass für einer echte 1:1-Steuerung die Signallaufzeiten z.B. zwischen Arizona und Afghanistan (und das über ein paar Satelliten) zu lang sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht ändern lassen, weil das Problem die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ist (das musste [Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) Militärs auch oft erklären).  Also wird die Entwicklung zu mehr Autonomie gehen, bis man dann eine Situation hat in der man ein Zielgebiet auswählt, und die Drohne startet. Die kreist dann darüber und meldet dann alles das, was ihr bekämpfungswürdig erscheint: Der Operator sieht dann die Sensordaten und trifft eine ja/nein-Entscheidung. Die Drohen bekämpft dann eigenständig das Ziel (derzeit muss ein Operator immer noch so einen Lasermarkierer auf das Terrroristenauto (oder das was man dafür hält) draufhalten). Die menschliche Entscheidung ist aus ethischen Gründen wichtig, aber auch weil kein Softwarehersteller verantwortlich sein will (wie es auch beim autonomen Fahren von Autos der Fall ist).  Manche Menschen zeichnen eine Horrorvision, in der manche Akteure (müssen keine Staaten sein) die Autonomie vervollständigen, weil sie keine ethischen Hemmungen haben, um damit die Oberhand z.B. im Luftkampf Drohnen gegen Drohe zu haben. Damit haben dann auch die Guten™ ein Argument den Menschen aus der Befehlskette zu nehmen usw.   Hörempfehlung zum Thema: [Alternativlos, Folge 27](http://alternativlos.org/27/)",™
t5_2qm4e,changeisinevitable89,1362823164,"--SCIENCE--  Theoretically, all languages differ in their written information rate being dependent on numerous factors like reader skill, text comprehensibility and even language-specific features like complexity, ambiguity, and symbol density.   However, to answer your question completely we would have to address an important aspect of how written language is recognized by human brains - pattern recognition.  Human beings have very good spatial skills (rapid eye movement and shape recognition) and their brains are exceptionally fast at pattern recognition. However, this does not mean that we can recognize a single-symbol ""©"" faster than the word ""copyright"". If we did, Chinese should be read at a significantly faster rate than English by native readers of the respective languages. But studies indicate that both languages are actually read at about the same speed. This essentially means that humans are not limited by pattern recognition in written language comprehension, and are as fast at recognizing long strings of shapes as they are at recognizing single shapes. The aforementioned research suggests that it is actually the higher level cognitive processes that limit language reading rates of individuals.    Sources:  [Sun F, Morita M, &amp; Stark LW (1985). Comparative patterns of reading eye movement in Chinese and English](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03204913?LI=true#page-3)  Sun, F, &amp; Feng, D (2010). Eye movements in reading Chinese and English text Reading Chinese Script: A cognitive analysis, Eds. Jian Wang, Albrecht W. Inhoff, Hsuan-Chih Chen., 189-205 ISBN: 9780805824780  Yan, G., Tian, H., Bai, X., &amp; Rayner, K. (2006). The effect of word and character frequency on the eye movements of Chinese readers British Journal of Psychology, 97 (2), 259-268 DOI: 10.1348/000712605X70066  --PSEUDOSCIENCE--  The real limitation of reading speed, therefore, is the underlying language processing power of our brains. When reading, we do not simply identify words, but invoke a plethora of concepts, ideas and knowledge about the words we read in our minds. Our brain takes time to process this information. From what we may easily observe, this is a much slower process than mere pattern recognition. The point of reading is to understand what we read, so the brain cannot possibly permit one to read faster than the rate at which it comprehends the written information. The brain's language abilities are scarcely researched yet we know that we tend to ""subvocalize"" and also ""visualize"" the words we identify in written language. There are claims by ""speed-readers"" that removing subvocalization will significantly improve one's reading speed; however, there is no hard science proving this.   Perhaps, owing to our excessive reliance on visual technology (electronic screens and written media), humans may someday invent visual languages devoid of vocalization so that the reading speed may be maximized. But doesn't that go even beyond the limits of layman speculation!? Please let me retire now.",©

t5_2qh9z,emergdoc,1362838540,"I found this on her blog. &gt;The elephant in the room: smoking. I didn’t do it a lot but I did do it: socially, at parties, doing research interviews if it made my interviewees feel more comfortable. I think that I thought that because I only did it a little, or because I was healthy in other areas of my life – that it wouldn’t matter. And although my doctors insist that the amount that I smoked was incidental to my diagnosis, I tend to disagree. Cancer acts very differently in different people and while some of us can get away with smoking a pack a day and live until we’re ninety, I think that for some of us, all it takes to contract LC is a couple of cigs a week.What is also notable – but hardly surprising – about the general discourse is how there is still an implicit emphasis on non-smokers being more deserving of a cure. (This could be my own insecurity, but every-time I come up negative for a new test that is more common in never smokers (EGFR, ALK), I feel that somehow I have failed at my cancer; that it’s because I am less deserving of a cure.) So, on top of all the other bullsh*t that cancer throws at you, LC has the added sweeteners of blame and guilt. This in turn, acts as a silencer for those of us, who, had we not smoked, might feel more entitled to have a voice in the debate. Instead of speaking up – screaming (or wheezing ☺) for a cure for this woefully underfunded disease – and taking the tobacco companies and other environmental polluters to task for their actions, we focus on our own guilt and quietly accept our ‘punishment’.  I only post this to illustrate the profound regret and anguish that smokers go though when they are diagnosed with cancer.    I don't post it for her, I post it for the smokers and the loved ones of smokers who will read this.  In my 20's, I too, was a ""social smoker""  I quit completely when I turned 30.  And even though more than 20 years have passed, I still have a small amount of dread that I'll get the hand on the shoulder by a colleague as they explain my chest x ray results.    Quitting smoking is better for your health than losing weight, exercising, getting regular check ups etc. etc.  Of course, you should do all of those things, but don't wait for the hand on the shoulder.",☺

You could try using a softer colour palette.  [These colours are worth a shot](http://i.imgur.com/6kqwCkC.png), just to see how they look.   * The white background on the card number (so the Q, 9, A, K etc) looks very distracting. I think you could leave it and change the font colour to something else.  * The cards look incredibly full, I can see that this is a concious decision, but give a smaller font a shot, or perhaps size the vector down a little bit.   * Minor detail could be that the little Hearts, diamonds etc are too close moved to the card they belong. so the ♥ is too close to the K in the top. Might want to move that down a little.  * The background is very cool, but perhaps does not fit the theme of the cards that well?   * The Heart ace looks amazing, very clever!  * The Queen / King icons are a little off.

t5_2snuc,ColdShoulder,1362890657,"Warning:  This turned out to be **way** longer than I had expected.  The common argument made by people like i_like_logic is that the horsemen (and also Sagan or Tyson) are viewed as prophets of science or philosophy or atheism where everything they say must be true as a matter of fact.  They argue that atheists trade the cult of Jesus or Muhammad for the cult of Dawkins or Hitchens.  As humans are quite prone to hero worship, this is going to occur with some people, but I think the complaints are far exaggerated.  The best thing about Dawkins or Hitchens is that they promoted positions that say, ""Seek the answers for yourself.""  Dawkins writes book after book attempting to show the beauty of evolution and reality.  He wants people to go out and search for the truth because the search for truth is worthwhile in itself.  This is an idea that I strongly support.  Hitchens believed that doubt was the great fuel for inquiry and discovery.  He absolutely hated worship of any kind (tied to his disdain for dictatorial authority and fascism), and so it’s safe to say that he certainly wasn't trying to get people to worship him.  He represented ideas that he found to be true, and he stood by them and defended them against all who would try to come at him.  This is one of the reasons I respected him as much as I did.  His strength in the face of adversity (whether it was defending his position on Iraq or his battle with cancer) was unbelievably inspiring.  I don't ""worship"" these people, but I respect them, because while they aren't perfect, they have personality traits that are worthy of respect.  They have both had positive impacts on my life, and I am lucid of that fact.  This doesn't mean I agree with them on everything, nor should I, but this is the point people miss.  When Hitchens stood up for what he believed on Iraq (specifically that it shouldn't be the private property of a sociopathic crime family), he was lambasted and labeled a neo-con, a warmonger.  He was Bush's poodle.  If you agree with Hitchens on his Iraq stance (or anything for that matter), you too are labeled a follower of the cult of Hitch.  Somehow, it's impossible that you might agree with him because you believe his position has merit.  In my opinion, this argument is often a masked attempt by the religious to equate atheism with religion.  ""You guys have faith too!  You just put it in science!""  or ""I worship Jesus.  You worship Dawkins.""  It’s quite the obvious display of false equivalence.  There are many nonbelievers who represent this position too though.  Having escaped the shackles of their religion’s “group-think”, they are especially averse to anything even remotely resembling a “tribe”.  They want to be “free™”.  This is made apparent by that ridiculous idea to label nonbelievers as freethinkers (which Dawkins supported, and I find absurd).   It is also a common position of many liberal, nonbelievers who might also argue, for instance, that 911 and the Jihad against the West were brought on entirely by American imperialism and that the Taliban are merely “free-fighters”.  It’s this “I belong to this group, but I don’t think like them” mentality.  It’s also very common in Christians on reddit.  It’s the whole, “I’m a Christian, but…”  I’m not sure if it comes as a result of our strong ties to individualism, but it’s pretty apparent and common.  So, now that I've rambled on for several paragraphs, I’ll state my point.  Humans, as social animals, are wired to follow and trust, and so you will often have large groups of people who admire Hitchens or Dawkins so much that it appears eerily similar to worship (and in some cases, I’m sure it is).  Seeing this, people are reminded of the similarities to worshipers of Jesus or Muhammad.  I think it misses the point though.  I don’t agree with Hitchens or Dawkins because I admire them.  I admire them because I agree with them.",™

t5_2snuc,ColdShoulder,1362899155,"&gt; The common argument made by people like i_like_logic is that the horsemen (and also Sagan or Tyson) are viewed as prophets of science or philosophy or atheism where everything they say must be true as a matter of fact.  &gt; If you agree with Hitchens on his Iraq stance (or anything for that matter), you too are labeled a follower of the cult of Hitch. Somehow, it's impossible that you might agree with him because you believe his position has merit.  &gt; It is also a common position of many liberal, nonbelievers who might also argue, for instance, that 911 and the Jihad against the West were brought on entirely by American imperialism and that the Taliban are merely “free-fighters”.  And then he stated...  &gt; New Atheist: I'm going to assert that everything we know about sociology and psychology is wrong because the new atheist I look up to tells me religions are to blame for a wide variety of today's conflicts.  So you're telling me that isn't exactly what I said?  Us ""New-atheists"" aren't ""free™""?  We just listen to our prophets, our dear leaders?  Religion has no negative impact on reality.

Wait for something to come up that points out a male problem in society, show it to her, be succinct with your point, then back off and let her ruminate on it.

t5_2qh03,wolfkin,1362935589,"&gt;I haven't seen anyone say it yet, but that does not make much sense to me. ""It's not a tomb raider game"". You raid tombs. While you are surviving.  semantic arguments. Yes this is a game about raiding tombs but it's not a ""Tomb Raider™"" game. The former being a description the latter being a set of gaming principles that have been established in a franchise of games. I can make a turn based dungeon crawler that's about raiding tombs. Just because I skin that game with Lara Croft that doesn't make it a ""Tomb Raider™"" game. The deeper debate is what exactly makes a Tomb Raider game, you've listed three things: tombs, raiding, surviving. I think that's a bit simplistic considering the number of other games that pretty much overlap on that. (that would make for an interesting Venn diagram)  This is a problem with descriptive franchise titles. People get confuse by semantics. This would be like making a movie about a girl who is homesick for her hometown in Indiana. Yes technically it matches the words but that's not an Indiana Jones movie.  My overall point is is not that this game isn't a Tomb Raider game\* but that the idea behind the complaint is real. It's not like any game that involves raiding tombs is a ""Tomb Raider™"" game there are things people that people can _reasonably_ expect from a franchise and when it's lacking you can be _reasonably_ surprised and disappointed.    \* having never played any Tomb Raider games myself it means pretty much nothing to me.  **Edit**: elaboration and quotation",™

He finds lovers by being a genuine person who makes his intentions known. He knows that women don't owe him sex or attraction, just as he doesn't owe them the same.

I thought everyone got when I was joking around, and I never treated anyone like my bullies had treated me. But a few months ago, a girl looked at my OKCupid profile and I sent her a message because she was pretty and had good taste. She replied, ""You were a dick to me in high school, goodbye."" I didn't remember her at all. Apparently, I was such a dick to someone I didn't really know and don't remember existing that she was still upset about it at least six years later.  And then I looked back at my behavior. And old e-mails. I was a bit of a tyrant at times. If someone said something I didn't like about a joke I made, I'd come back with something that cut them disproportionately deep. After my first love dumped me, I wrote a song bashing her and played it at a show. In all honesty, I don't know how I had as many friends as I did. I was ~*so~*edgy~, I wore a fedora, I was a Nice Guy™, and I was just a massive cockhole to anyone who dared cross me.

Just because you're a decent human doesn't mean I want you either romantically or sexually - you need to have something more on top of that to sell yourself. Being decent is the acceptable baseline, don't bitch about getting ""friendzoned"" because either you didn't make your intentions clear and thought just being nice would make her fall in love with you, or because you go ""man I'm such a nice guy why won't you have sex with me?""  At 2013-03-10 15:06:46 UTC, [/u/DrunkenRob](/u/DrunkenRob) wrote [+111 points: +132, -21]:  &gt; I think there is a bigger problem here. Western culture tends to romanticise the idea of chivalry. Boys are taught growing up that being nice, generous, and kind are what it takes to be a young gentleman. Somewhere along the line they are given the impression that being a gentleman SHOULD get them the woman of their dreams without any context on real-world human interaction. I call this the ""Prince Charming"" effect. &gt;  &gt; So they finally  find a woman who they are really attracted to and they think, ""She's the one for me!"" So they go into Prince Charming mode and fall all over themselves trying to impress her. Lend her money, clean her place, give her a shoulder to cry on. They believe by demonstrating their worth to the girl she will realize that he was what she always wanted. &gt;  &gt; Except that she doesn't care about how he feels. He's a really nice guy, and if nice guys are really nice they would just do these things because they...should, would, like to...? Can't say there is a justification that makes sense in my mind for a girl to justify allowing this behavior.  &gt;  &gt; So she goes on with her life, dating the men she's actually attracted to and taking advantage of all the benefits their friendship gives them. Problem is, they buy into the Prince Charming fallacy themselves. I should like the nice guy, who does nice things, but I don't. So I'll give him the pleasure of my company, and he can do things for me. &gt;  &gt; Finally the guy comes to his senses and either A. Finds another girl that actually is attracted to him. Or B. They finally say ""forget this shit"" and leave her.  &gt;  &gt; Now the girl is left alone to justify the relationship. ""Why won't he continue doing the things he did when we were ""best friends"". He must have never cared about me!"" Then they go online and see all this friend zone bullshit. But surely that can't apply to her situation. He must be just like every asshole I've ever dated! He must just want sex! What a pig! He was never really nice to me! He's just another asshole who only wants one thing! &gt;  &gt; The guy should have made his intentions clear early on. The girl should know better than to take advantage of a guy's ""niceness"" because they should know how friendships work. A guy shouldn't be a shlub and think he can somehow change a woman's mind by doing the things for them they would usually reserve for a girlfriend. Girls should not allow for a relationship that's basically a boyfriend without any emotional investment. It's a two way street. &gt;  &gt; Source* guy who used to buy into all this bullshit but now knows better.

AlyoshaV and the unnatural growth of our subreddit thanks to that blasted bot.  aw, thanks ♥  srsly though, to reiterate my argument quickly (which jess disagrees with IIRC): I believe that SRD was already well on the path to become what it is today, and I merely sped it up. SRD was better when I started running my bot, but it wasn't *good*.  &gt;Come up with some new ideas...think outside your normal spectrum of thought (I'll do the same) and stop circlejerking and droning on about the same ""fixalls"" that work for your subs.  The only fix that could possibly work for making SRD a better place, in my opinion, is to ban the shitty people with as little warning as possible. I recognize that this would also cause SRD's readers to catch on fire.  A major issue is that SRD is pretty much being colonized by the biggest shitheads on reddit, from SRSS/WhiteRights/MensRights/etc. I don't know how to fix that, but it's unquestionably an issue.  Oh yeah, and you/the other mods of SRD need to accept that if somebody is doing something really shitty *outside of SRD*, they can be banned for it. Of the three times I've seen an SRD user telling someone to commit suicide in an invaded thread, twice the mods I talked to essentially told me to fuck off, which is *fucking ridiculous*.",♥

Just curious, what made you think the lineup would be good?  They were 23rd in runs scored in 2011, and added one guy (Reyes).  He's a good player, but he's not Babe Ruth.  The rotation wasn't that solid either.  They had a good one-two, but #3 was Ricky Nolasco who had a career 4.50 ERA going into 2012, #4 was Anibal Sanchez aka Ollie Perez Lite™, and rounding out the rotation with out of shape crazy loon Carlos Zambrano, coming off his worst year ever, was not exactly proactive GM-ing either.

Therefore an [NTM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-deterministic_Turing_machine) is a preferrable way to solve them. Our neural networks can actually be seen as NTM.  On the other hand, it's not yet proven that [NP doesn't belong to P](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/06/the-girl-who-proved-p-np.html) ;-)  However, as NP hard problems usually have an exponential time dependency, and a massively parallel evolutionary algorithm (as e.g. neural networks) has an exponential convergence rate, they will even out...  I exemplified this with the coming Singularity (my project) on [my blog in Nov](http://rolandorre.se/?p=175).  Hei :-) Did I just prove that NP=P... ?  PS.

I followed the videos from [braukaiser.com](http://braukaiser.com/wiki/index.php?title=Decoction_Mashing#Videos), they were very helpful.  Kai did a enhanced double decoction example in the 3 set video series.  I followed the rest temps he does in the videos.  It would take too long to type it all out, so I would recommend anyone watching them if they had 30 minutes total to spare and were interested in the decoction mashing process.  We did two of the same brews side by side to get a true comparison of any taste difference.    For the single infusion mash, the rest was at 155 degrees for 60 minutes with a mash out at 170, then boil for an hour.   Recipe: 7.25 lbs. German 2-row Pils .5 lbs. Weyermann CaraFoam® 3.5 lbs. German Dark Munich .20 lbs. American Chocolate Malt .20 lbs. Weyermann Carafa III® 1.5 oz. Hallertau (Pellets, 4.50 %AA) boiled 60 minutes. .5 oz.

t5_2qplv,Optimal_Joy,1363020408,"That's my point, in my personal opinion, it's better to say ""tissue paper"" or something like that instead of ""Kleenex"".  I try to be very conscious of the impact of branding in my life.  I recently watched a very enlightening movie, called Branded.  [Here is a link to the trailer video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HInOg12jMiY)  Needless to say, it was very good!  Whoever made that video was clearly a psychonaut.  At some point in our lives, we need to realize that we've all been heavily brainwashed with propaganda, marketing, education, etc.  All that I'm trying to point out is that you've used a trademark brand name in place of using the generic term.  I'm guilty of this, as I often still refer to ""Photoshop"" as a verb.  Even Adobe doesn't want people to do this!  Here is some nausea inducing copy pasta from [their website](http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html):      PROPER USE OF THE PHOTOSHOP TRADEMARK  Trademarks help protect corporate and product identity, and the Photoshop trademark is one of Adobe's most valuable trademarks. By following the below guidelines, you can help Adobe protect the Photoshop brand name.  The Photoshop trademark must never be used as a common verb or as a noun. The Photoshop trademark should always be capitalized and should never be used in possessive form or as a slang term. It should be used as an adjective to describe the product and should never be used in abbreviated form. The following examples illustrate these rules:  Trademarks are not verbs.  Correct: The image was enhanced using Adobe® Photoshop® software. Incorrect: The image was photoshopped.  Trademarks are not nouns.  Correct: The image pokes fun at the Senator.  Incorrect: The photoshop pokes fun at the Senator.  Always capitalize and use trademarks in their correct form.  Correct: The image was enhanced with Adobe® Photoshop® Elements software.  Incorrect: The image was photoshopped.  Incorrect: The image was Photoshopped.  Incorrect: The image was Adobe® Photoshopped.  Trademarks must never be used as slang terms.  Correct: Those who use Adobe® Photoshop® software to manipulate images as a hobby see their work as an art form.  Incorrect: A photoshopper sees his hobby as an art form. Incorrect: My hobby is photoshopping.  Trademarks must never be used in possessive form.  Correct: The new features in Adobe® Photoshop® software are impressive. Incorrect: Photoshop's new features are impressive.  Trademarks are proper adjectives and should be followed by the generic terms they describe.  Correct: The image was manipulated using Adobe® Photoshop® software.  Incorrect: The image was manipulated using Photoshop.  Trademarks must never be abbreviated.  Correct: Take a look at the new features in Adobe® Photoshop® software. Incorrect: Take a look at the new features in PS.  The trademark owner should be identified whenever possible.  Adobe and Photoshop are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.",®

t5_2qhhk,PaginaDentata,1363024713,"Pibble apologists are doing far more harm to pit bulls than ""thugs.""  Pit bulls have always been kept by ""thugs."" They were created and bred for blood sports like dogfighting and hog-dogging. In the early 1970s, dogfighting and other ""thug"" activities were widespread, but pit bull euthanasias were low even though overall euthanasia numbers were very high.   With the emergence of the pit bull lobby in the late 1970s and 1980s, the rate of pit bull euthanasias has absolutely exploded even as overall euthanasia numbers have plummeted. Experts estimate that shelters in the United States now kill nearly one million pit bulls per year – that’s more than the total number of purebred dogs the American Kennel Club registers annually.  Not coincidentally, [the rate of severe dog attacks has also exploded since then](http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb101.pdf).  The difference between the 1970s and now is that discriminating between dog breeds wasn't regarded as ""racism"" and pit bulls were kept primarily by people who respected the dogs' capacities, risks, and intended purpose. Pit bulls weren't kept by ""pibble mommies"" with persecution complexes. They weren't marketed as ""nanny dogs"" or a hip new karma-generating accessory.  This is what happens when you rebrand a fundamentally challenging, higher-risk breed as America's Misunderstood Nanny Dog™. People adopt them, having drank the ""sweetest dogs ever"" Kool-Aid, and too late they discover that pit bulls are actually [more difficult to deal with than other dogs](http://www.petfinder.com/journal/index.cgi?article=422), [tend to be explosively aggressive toward other animals](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17vjdv/can_you_recommend_a_family_dog_that_is_highly/c89fstq), [tend to bite and not let go](http://www.pbrc.net/breaksticks.html), et cetera. The dogs are euthanized or returned to the shelter in droves. I saw this on a microcosmic scale in my own work in rescue, and this is happening all over the country.   [Cities with BSL (bans and restrictions) have the lowest rates of pit bull euthanasias of any major metros in the U.S.](http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/anp/2012/10/19/editorial-pit-bulls-political-recklessness/)  [BSL is also effective in reducing serious dog bite injuries](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1a1scu/does_anyone_know_some_good_articles_on_breed/c8tfg78?context=3).  I honestly wonder how long the pit bull apologists and their incomprehensibly stupid bleats about canine racism can persist. I started wondering that back in 2005, when Nicholas Faibish of San Francisco was killed by his family's pit bulls. 149 Americans have been killed by pit bulls since then.",™

t5_2uvah,Artful_Bodger,1363036237,"I would be happy to do so if the Reddit gods are willing:   Rand’s drone diatribe also true for guns  by Neil Steinberg  nsteinberg@suntimes.com  Last Modified: Mar 11, 2013 02:17AM  Let’s see if I have this straight.  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), the Tea Party darling, caught our nation’s attention last week by filibustering against the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director.  An old-fashioned, “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” seize-the-floor-and-don’t-let-go filibuster, Paul spoke for 13 hours against drones, which the government has used to kill terrorist suspects in Pakistan and Yemen.  That isn’t the problem for Paul. The problem is that President Obama has not ruled out such drone attacks on American soil.  “He was elected by a majority,” Paul said. “But the majority doesn’t get to decide who we execute.”  This is the same Paul who is a fierce opponent of all gun-control laws, who wanted to push a bill to nullify the executive actions Obama took after Newtown, who has revealed that he and his staff go about armed, and who urges everyone else to do so, too.  Let’s see if we can connect these two political beliefs in the Randian universe.  On the one hand: The government cannot be trusted to identify a person as being so much of a threat he should be killed.  On the other: Any random citizen can.  The government should never be allowed to sidestep the system of laws we have in place to ensure that an American suspected of wrongdoing receives justice. That’s bad.  But individuals — Paul would like to see every teacher carry a gun — can and should. That’s good. Indeed, we should pass “stand your ground” laws to ease this process.  Is it just me who sees a disconnect here?  Understand, I agree with him about drones. Obama’s legacy will be significantly tarnished by his willingness to suspend law while fighting terrorism. Not so much as the idea of lethal force being necessary — we empower every police office to make such decisions every day. We don’t want our leaders flipping through the Code of Federal Regulations while terrorists skip past them.  The issue is Obama’s reluctance to allow a transparent legal process to follow such a decision. A police officer shoots someone in an alley, his superiors investigate the shooting and rule it justified or unjustified. Why should it be any less for the president? The American people are his superiors.  And yes, when dealing with Paul et al., we are talking about people who despise the government and don’t want it to do anything — collect taxes, treat the sick, give aid to foreign allies, you name it. So the fact they also don’t want the government using unmanned drones to rain hellfire missiles down on our fellow citizens at its whim is not a dramatic shift. And as I said, I don’t want that either.  But not because of the drones per se. Drones are the perfect red meat to agitate the Tea Party element — the same crowd who can conjure black helicopters circling their heads out of a clear blue sky. The fact that drones really exist, and are actually out there, somewhere, shows a sort of progress for them. At least they’re getting upset over something with a basis in reality this time.  Though to me, the problem isn’t the drone part — that’s more fear of the new, and when drones become a common part of our lives, reporting on traffic and such, we’ll smile at how afraid of them we were, the way we once scared ourselves about how computers would someday “take over” (of course, they sort of have, but that’s another column).  To me, the problem is executing people without trial. It doesn’t matter how it’s done — drone, poison dart, anvil dropped from a window. If you’re killed you’re killed. What matters is whether we are drifting away from being a nation of laws ­— in theory, the practice was always squishy — and creating an official gray kill zone.  “When a democracy gets it wrong,” Paul said during his filibuster last week, “you want the law to be in place.”  Exactly. You want the law to be in place. You don’t want the government blowing up the cars of people it doesn’t like on the Edens Expressway. You don’t want to live in a community of armed vigilantes dispensing justice as they see fit at every bar, school and gas station. The gun debate comes down to fear — I am not so afraid for my life that I need a gun to lull me into thinking I’m safe, even though the gun makes me more imperiled than I’d be without it. Nor am I so afraid of terror that I want to see 225 years of American legal process scrapped, so the president can kill whoever he thinks is a danger. Or if that is allowed, I want a public legal framework that examines his decision. Because presidents make mistakes. As do citizens. We have enough police officers, trained and responsible, who shoot the wrong people.  “No American should be killed on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court,” Paul said on the floor of the Senate last week. How could that be true for armed drones but not for armed civilians?  Copyright © 2013 — Sun-Times Media, LLC  ",©

What at first seemed to be a beautiful woman turned out to be a creation of Dr. Plastique, a plastic surgeon who gathered the leftover bits from his operations and put them together and added a touch of eye shadow to create the new contestant. Dr. Plastique calls this mysterious woman RealWoman 3000™. After making her surprise appearance, one of the contestants could be heard saying that “the new girl better watch her fat battery pack”.  During the swimsuit section of the competition RealWoman3000™ could be seen making duck faces because it “went with the water theme you silly goose”. For the talent portion RealWoman3000™ began singing “Somewhere over the rainbow” in a dead African language, dancing to the tune of “Merry had a Little Lamb”, and baking an eight course meal all at the same time. During her performance one of the judges was so overwhelmed at RealWoman3000’s™ multitasking abilities that he passed out, and was removed from the facility. Once the top five contestants were put onstage, among them RealWoman 3000™, a fight broke out with Miss Utah and Miss Alaska over whether she should be allowed to compete. The fight ended with RealWoman 3000™ standing over four unconscious women and clamming the crown for herself. Dr. Plastique is “very proud.”",™

They're in regular contact, lurk on lesser-known or unknown accounts, hold office hours regularly, read feedback, follow blogs, converse, …  To a decent extent, they try and work with that. It's just not necessarily fast, either due to internal failures or just because Shit Happened™. Or sometimes what Residents want is impractical, or conflicts with their plans, or they just disagree. But, in general, it's heard and eventually acted on. Offering to implement something yourself is always a good way to get that done.

t5_2qh2p,Chimie45,1363077798,"Viking  Scandinavian pirate, 1807, vikingr; modern spelling attested from 1840. The word is a historical revival; it was not used in M.E., but it was revived from O.N. vikingr, which usually is explained as prop. ""one who came from the fjords,"" from vik ""creek, inlet"" (cf. O.E. wic, M.H.G. wich ""bay,"" and second element in Reykjavik). But O.E. wicing and O.Fris. wizing are almost 300 years older, and probably derive from wic ""village, camp"" (temporary camps were a feature of the Viking raids), related to L. vicus ""village, habitation"" (see villa). The connection between the O.N. and O.E. words is still much debated. The period of Viking activity was roughly 8c. to 11c. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the raiding armies generally were referred to as þa Deniscan ""the Danes,"" while those who settled in England were identified by their place of settlement. &gt;viking.

And it'll be an accident, like I'm poking around his attic crawlspace looking for hair clumps and skin flakes I can collect, or ex-girlfriends severed body parts, and suddenly I detect the quietest chorus of angelic screaming. I follow the sound, and parting sheets of fibreglass I find it hidden in the wall. I take off the dust cover and sit for the better part of the day marveling at the bloodlust, and autistic attention to detail. I go home and get My First Auschwitz™, and secret it away into his attic. He's at work. I know his schedule. We text each other every half hour. He won't be coming home anytime soon. I have time. I put my model in the wall beside his, gently folding the insulation back over them. Of course mine has its own dust cover. What am I, a farmer? Biting open an almost-healed over wound, I paint a trail of hearts from the hideaway door to our little hiding spot. I write, ""I know where you sleep"" with hearts all around it, and leave some dramatic zombie hand-drags on the insulation. They create contrast, symbolizing our life-long struggle to retain our life-force while dreaming of being more than mortal. Blood trails are our rose petals.

t5_2qhk3,Thievishmetal69,1363126601,"&gt;no one is saying you're automatically a rapist because you're a man.  Half of all feminist propaganda is about portraying men, masculinity, and maleness as aggressive and ""rapey"".  From creep shaming to these ""anti rape"" campaigns purposefully targeted at men telling them not to rape thus making the insinuation that without someone their to remind them, men just go rape crazy.  Oddly enough the only other conversation you hear the term ""rape crazy"" is about way back when, laws were made to protect the dainty privileged as fuck white women from those evil rapey black men.  &gt;just like women are told to exercise caution  You're saying this like its a bad thing, my god, society actually cares about the safety and well being of women, EVIL FUCKING SOCIETY.  Holy shit the cognitive dissonance  is just astounding.  Compare that attitude towards women with the total indifference to men by society...  &gt;just like you're not automatically a rape victim because you're a woman.  Really because from what I've seen practically anything that happens to a woman is rape, from being stared at to having drunken sex.  It's all fucking rape it would seem, do you even pay attention to the crap we see in this sub?  Guess not.  &gt;they're **telling** women not to become victims and** men not to have unconsensual sex. SO??**  And if you posted flyers around black neighborhoods saying ""don't rob, or kill people"" the NAACP would go on a fucking tirade about how racist it is, but men are ""privileged"" and its okay to demonize men because ""patriarchy™"".  &gt;get over yourself. 90-something% of all rapists against male and female victims happen to be male.  Minority of X group commit Y crime upon Z group, therefore that justifies demonizing X group with vicious and often falsely backed  propaganda.

t5_2qzb6,bullshadow,1363131256,"This was posted here on reddit a while ago but I was wondering how accurate is this? Could I actually use this to get over a traumatic event such as a bad breakup? Or the loss of a loved one?   &gt;  Well then, let me take over this woozy perspective with some Science™, bitches. OP, try a little variation on a nifty little thing called cognitive reappraisal. Science bases what I'm about to describe on three things: one, our brain has a tendency to make sure visualization is prioritized above and overrides our reason, and second, a brain is almost completely incapable of separating vivid fantasy from reality. Third, writing something down has a more lasting neutralizing effect on your emotions than just thinking it. That kept in mind, let's move on. You say you hold grudges, right? Well, the following technique has been observed to relieve year-long held grudges more effectively than years of therapy. That's right, I'm offering you an easier, quicker, more believable and more effective treatment than any of what is stated in the above post. Read right on to find out what it is. Follow these quick and easy steps to get your very own peace of mind: Think of a person that has wronged you. Write them a letter, preferably handwritten, in which you detail exactly what you wish you could say to them and sign it, leaving absolutely nothing filtered or censored. Remember, this is your fantasy. Write back a letter to yourself, in their name, in which they tell you precisely what you want to hear. Be it an apology, an explanation, appreciation -- everything you feel you'd need in reality to stop feeling resentment towards them. After you've finished this letter, sign it as well, again in their name. Read back this second letter every night before you go to bed over the course of a week. By the end of the week, you'll notice that, even upon meeting them in person, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing. You will be able to treat them as if they've righted their wrong, because even though perhaps you don't cognitively believe it, you do feel that emotional satisfaction and relief. Now then, did you know that many placebos work even when the patient knows he's being deceived? This is one of those placebos. Hilariously, I can explain in full detail that you're tricking your mind, and it'll work all the better because of it. Relevant studies I can share upon request. (Or, you could read The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane.) And don't mind me using infomercial-type communication; I'm just having a jolly good time. N.B.: Science™: it works, bitches!  edit: bad formatting and a word ",™

Tygon is a bio-compatible medical tubing that is highly flexible. It should be changed every few months as it stiffens and discolors from extended wear. PTFE, a white plastic, is widely accepted within the industry. Some polymers are marketed specifically for piercings in an array of colors and shapes. These may be worn as a substitute for metal jewelry. With new polymer products coming into the marketplace, check that the product you are purchasing, if not listed above, is USP VI compliant.

t5_2rww2,Little2,1363145879,"I usually pick a color or group of colors in my head before I start. For example, one day I'll do just a neutral matte eye with browns. Other days maybe blue shadow with grays, or salmon with brown. Sometimes I'm inspired by others, like pics of my fellow makeup addicts.  Anyway, once I have my idea I my head I start swatching on the inside of my forearm. I find this skin closer to my eye skin color than the back of my hand. I put anywhere from 2 to 5 colors together and sometimes even swatch a liner to go with them. After you learn what looks good together you don't have to swatch anymore... Until the next haul! Here is a good example, I used yellow, green, and then in the crease this almost purple-brown. all shimmer finishes. http://i.imgur.com/W4EZM4p.jpg I think swatching is important, because even if eyeshadows are the same color, the finish makes a big difference, matte, satin, shimmer, glitter, etc. Also, I just purchases 3 palettes that I'm eager to get delivered. I ordered the bh cosmetics 120 palette 5th edition, the tropical 88 matte palette, and the tropical 88 shimmer palette. I'm an addict. 💉",💉

So much so, that when someone says it in front of me I assume that's what they mean, and they'd have to go pretty far to prove they hate men before I took the phrase seriously.  If you are on SRS you should know that there is a vast difference in the cultural baggage of the phrase ""I hate men"" and ""I hate women/gays/people of color"" (Of course it's never phrased so neatly.) They aren't the same because of context.  I don't hear the phrase often, but if I do, it's uttered in mock exasperation, the way someone might say ""I hate math"" after a particularly grueling or tedious homework assignment.  You haven't provided much context to your sister's statement. I have a friend who often says she hates men, and if I left it at that, she could look like a True Misandrist™. When I add that she has been in an abusive relationship with a man she is now forever tied to because of an accidental pregnancy and as a hetero cis woman it's ruined her faith in intimacy and relationships, then it should become more understandable that she is simply venting or even trying to reaffirm her own sense of agency and worth.  I don't mind when PoC say ""I hate white people"" and I don't mind when trans* people say ""I hate cis people"" because they are statements aimed towards their oppressors. They aren't borne of malice, they're made from some combination of frustration, sadness, and defiance. As a lesbian, straight men are indeed your sister's oppressors and she has every right to voice her frustrations towards them, and they don't have to be constructive either.  ",™

t5_2rete,JayKayAu,1363167694,"&gt; to get more output from less input  What we should be aiming for is to keep the input side constant, while increasing the output side.  If the input side drops, we get more unemployment. And if there's less money circulating around in salaries, we may end up in a recessionary spiral. Which would not be good.  So we should be trying to get more output from our (relatively) constant inputs. That's where efficiency is good and useful.  But there is a trick here: To get ever increasing productivity from your population, you need to be serious about education, skills, financial security and flexibility.   I'm not convinced we take these seriously enough.  On education and skills, we have an elitist approach (we're busy trying to create the Best-of-the-Best™), rather than an equalising approach (creating a broad-base of well educated people).  On financial security and flexibility, we've got politicians deregulating labour markets (making it easier to hire and fire) without buttressing individuals with financial certainty (proper unemployment insurance).

t5_2qh6c,missssghost,1363186849,"I definitely relate. I never wanted to go to a therapist either. I was way too shy/introverted to seek out help. To be honest with you, the only reason I did end up going was because my boyfriend at the time was really worried about me, and made the appointment for me, and went with me for support and waited for me in the lobby.   I kind of just cried through the whole first appointment - mostly because having discuss my thoughts makes me really anxious/makes me cry/hyperventilate. It was really exhausting and embarrassing, but the people who worked there were incredibly accepting and patient.    It's really hypocritical of me to suggest seeking help because of how I wasn't able to seek it on my own, and after a few months worth of appointments -- both because I felt better about certain aspects of how I can handle my emotions and had a bad breakup with my bf -- I missed an appointment, and was too anxious to ever call to reschedule ! (this was over two years ago)   I'm a pretty messy person when it comes to taking care of myself sometimes, though more so then than now.   I think we have probably experienced some pretty similar things. Some days I can wake up feeling my most miserable, and by the early evening feel as though I can take on the whole world. It fluctuates a lot.   Some days I also feel a little crazy but I don't like that term, it's so negative. My emotions can really turn on a dime but in recent years I've become more accepting of it/have found personal ways to handle that flow ~   I would still recommend making an appointment with a specialist if you can manage it. Even though I didn't follow through with it for that long, even just going that first time did make me feel a lot better. The act of going, of being proactive, made me feel more in control of myself.   If approaching a psychologist really isn't an option for you at this point, perhaps reading up about depression/bi-polar disorder could help navigate your experience of it.

Here's a version of the article on the [Denver Post](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_22779758/fort-morgan-school-bars-mom-from-shirt-punishment) and [9news](http://www.9news.com/news/article/323270/339/Mom-wants-kids-to-wear-bully-thief-shirts).   **Below is the [coloradoan](http://www.coloradoan.com/proart/20130313/news11/303130016/mom-wants-kids-wear-bully-thief-shirts-school?pagerestricted=1) article** &gt;FORT MORGAN - Jessica Rocha loves her children. But, she says she has run out of options in trying to curb their bad behavior at school. &gt; &gt;She created a t-shirt with a message that the school won't let her share. &gt; &gt;""We have taken away toys. We have taken away sports. We have taken away girl scouts,"" the kid's mom Rocha said. ""I've tried nothing everything else. Nothing else is working."" &gt; &gt;Rocha says her fiancé's 8-year-old daughter, Aurora, and her 9-year-old son, Xavier, are having serious problems at their school, Green Acres Elementary. Rocha wants us to show their faces and tell their story, but 9News has decided not to use the last name of the kids (which is different than mom's) to protect them from internet searches in the future. &gt; &gt;Aurora admits she likes to steal things. So, Rocha took a black marker and wrote these words in a regular t-shirt,""I steal. Steal means taking property belonging to someone else without permission."" On the back it reads, ""I steal. Please watch me."" &gt; &gt;""She would steal from Wal-Mart, from the neighbor, from a friend's house, from my purse,"" Rocha said. &gt; &gt;Rocha says Xavier has been defiant and aggressive since first grade. &gt; &gt;""Xavier is a bully in school. He likes to back talk teachers, do hateful things to students,"" said Rocha. ""He argues thinks he's right about everything."" &gt; &gt;She had planned on making a ""bully"" shirt for Xavier. But, when Aurora wore the ""thief"" shirt to her 2nd grade class, the principal made her cover it up. District officials told Rocha that she cannot make her kids wear these shirts to school. &gt; &gt;""I respect her right to do what's best for her family,"" said Ron Echols, superintendent of Fort Morgan Schools. ""But, I wish she would leave the school out of it. We cannot support something that is demeaning to the kids."" &gt; &gt;Rocha says the school is overstepping its bounds. &gt; &gt;""I don't think a T-shirt is harming my child at all,"" Rocha said. &gt; &gt;When asked what happened at school when she wore the shirt for that one day, Aurora said, ""I just made fun of."" &gt; &gt;Xavier did not want to talk to us. Rocha says she has discussed the use of the T-shirts with police and social services. She says since wearing the shirt at school, Aurora has stopped stealing. &gt; &gt;""She was more embarrassed and more ashamed of what she had done by wearing the T-shirt than being grounded or having her toys taken away,"" Rocha said. ""She has to answer to her peers. These are the kids that she's going to grow up with."" &gt; &gt;Echols did not want to offer any more comments, since this is an ongoing matter. But, he did raise the question if this is fair to other kids who might wonder why Xavier and Aurora are wearing these T-shirts. &gt; &gt;Rocha says she just do something to teach her kids that they can't misbehave in school and steal or bully their classmates. She wants them to be accountable to fellow students. &gt; &gt;""We are trying to parent at home, so they don't end up in foster care. So, they don't end up in jail. So, they don't end up in prison later on,"" Rocha said. ""I am trying to be proactive in their school life as well as their home life."" &gt; &gt;(KUSA-TV © 2013 Multimedia Holdings Corporation",©

No horse with a jockey (or nation with a private central bank) can win in a race with a horse without a jockey (or nation without a private central bank). Do you know how much gold Germany has? They say it has 1,300 tonnes of gold BUT it will take 7 years for The Fed to return the first 300 tonnes of gold. So really Germany has NO gold. Same thing with all the other nations that have their gold stored with a private central bank. Do you know how much gold the government of Iran has? 1,000 tonnes! and they really, really DO have that gold in their hands.    All this enmity can be over tomorrow if Iran would just let the international financiers be the ones who issue Irans money as a debt owing interest. In America we pay our private central bank 1% of everything right off the top. (for the last 99 years) Of coarse we don't pay them in the money they print, as they can and do print all the money in the world. We pay them in cold, hard, GOLD!",♥

t5_2qh68,Jkb77,1363225035,"No your not limited to just daytime minutes, daytime is specifically mention because most plans that offer fee minutes are limited to free evening and weekends and saktel has had free evenings and weekends for at least a decade so its not something to bother advertising. They are unlimited minutes any time, I have been on this plan for a while now.   BTW I hit the 10GB soft cap on my phone every single month without fail. 5 GB my be a lot in your eyes but it is severely lacking in mine. especially since they charge you  $10/GB when you exceed the 5 GB limit If you used the same 10 GB on bell as I get on Sasktel you would have to add an extra $50 then it would be a $110 plan and you still can't go past that 10GB for free at a reduced speed.  Sasktel data is Canada wide as well. I work in Alberta and use it all the time there. I do like the unlimited anytime minutes across Canada on bell though, you're right it is a bit better than what Sasktel offer is that regard.   The bell plan is a bit better in air time but Sasktel's plan is more than twice as good in data. I would still take the Sasktel plan over the bell plan in a second.  Lets compare phones.  BlackBerry Z10 both have it  BlackBerry Curve 9320 both have it  BlackBerry Bold 9900 both have it  Samsung Galaxy Note II both have it  Samsung Galaxy S III both have it  Samsung Galaxy Discover  both have it  Samsung Galaxy Rugby both have it  Samsung Galaxy S II HD LTE Sasktel does not have this one and bell does because Sasktel discontinued it and I imagine bell will follow soon.  Samsung ATIV S both have it  Samsung Galaxy Ace II x Only bell has this, but really who would want this shitty phone?  LG Optimus G both have it  LG Optimus L5 both have it  LG Eclypse Only Sasktel has this one, but this is a shit phone that hardly anyone probably buys.  HTC Desire C Sasktel only on this one as well  HTC One V Sasktel has it bell don't  Iphone 4 4s and 5 both of them have them all  Sony Xperia™ T and Windows Phone 8X by HTC are both on bell but not sasktel.   Bell has 4 that Sasktel don't and Sasktel has 3 that bell don't have... So Bell has one more phone than Sakktel big friggin deal. ",™

It's not just your music it's YOU; you're such an optimistic, amazing person. You get me through all the hard times (which, trust me, are way too often) with your follow-your-dreams attitude and adorable personality. (I bet we'll be married one day, just watch!)  Anyway, I'm an aspiring rockstar (I don't like the word ""Singer""; ""rockstar"" sounds more like the full package like guitarist, songwriter, etc.) from a small city in Ontatrio (gee, doesn't this sound like Avril Lavigne's story!) and really all I want to do is get the hell out of this city and just go to LA where I can actually make my life (and talents) worth something. You know what I mean? I make YouTube videos of me singing but not just like cover videos--I make actual music videos 'cause I'm super computer nerdy and love editing. Other than promoting myself via YouTube (62 Subscribers and counting; feelin' proud.) and I'm also signed to a model &amp; talent agency (being an extra in commercials and music videos is a good start I guess) what would your tips be for someone trying to make it as a rockstar? I taught myself guitar, piano, drums and I'm dabbling at bass right now, and I sing nonstop, of course. What would be your tips on making it in music? Living in LA would be a good start but I can't for a few years. Annnd there aren't any record labels in my city. I live near Toronto where there are a few but not like in LA. (Being signed to Big Evil is one of my many dreams aside from playing MSG &amp; marrying you. ♥) Sorry this was super-long, I'm probably boring you with blahblahihatemylifeiwanttobefamous. And if you see this weirdo on Twitter who tweets you 24/7 named @BlackStarDiva13 or this other weirdo on Instagram who comments first on all your pictures named @Mrs_Taubenfeld...yeah that's me. :)  Well I made a music video for Best Years Of Our Lives and if you'd watch it..that'd be amazing. The vocals suck because I was using a new editing software so the editing is a little odd but I think you'd really like this video. PS: You're in it. :)  So yeah, just tell me whatever you can on how I should get into the music industry (if you honestly don't know how to answer that just say ""hi"" and I'll be happy.)  Thanks for your time Evan! Love you! PS: I cried all four times you tweeted me. And the first time I was at work! I cried soo hard and my coworkers would not stop laughing. Then I had to leave early. :) PPS: Will you marry me? haha ♥ PPPS: Here's the link! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOioFmQoHAs PPPPS: Our voices sound amazing together at 1:23 &lt;3 PPPPPS: I did too many ""PS""s, sorry!   -xoxo Molly [Taubenfeld]",♥

t5_2qh03,Shambloroni,1363231456,"I'll preface by saying this is probably unfair of me, but personally the Halo thing just kind of rubbed me the wrong way (and I'm sure a lot of other PC gamers). While not the first console FPS✝, it seemed to launch this...phenomenon where people discovered the joy of competitively shooting at each other for the first time. I played it and it was certainly a good game but I thought, man, you guys could have been having this kind of fun years ago with some of the greatest games of all time in Quake, Unreal, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, etc. The popularity only continued to grow while most of the Halo fans I knew were never exposed to the swath of PC titles which was frustrating. I could tell them how great those games were but they would never experience them as PC gaming was even more niche in the 90's.  Think of it this way, let's say you have some friends. These friends only discover/listen/purchase music after they've heard it on the radio (console) because they don't have access to other means (niche 90's PC gaming). For the past couple years you've found some good bands to listen to via your computer. Suddenly a song comes out on the radio that gains a lot of popularity and is similar to the music you've been listening to. You don't have to hate it - you might even say ""Hey, that's a good song."" The sales for this new band go through the roof and your friends buy it up. You want to say, if you like that music, listen to what I've been enjoying the past few years. There's nothing wrong with them liking the new band over the music you've discovered but unfortunately your friends will never get to decide. They won't hear the good music you found...but you'll be hearing about that radio song for quite a while.  ✝ Obviously Goldeneye was the first hallmark console FPS and while matches were certainly heated, I wouldn't really consider it a competitive shooter, guys weren't hauling TV's over for LAN games, there was no internet community, etc.",✝

t5_2cneq,justagirl90210,1363236756,"Even though everyone in here is poo-pooing this notion, there are legitimate problems with premarital sex. It has a tendency to lead to single parent families. Right now, there are a lot of poor, uneducated assholes fucking like rabbits and having kids as teenagers, and they really could use some kind of societal pressure to shame them away from this behavior. Sex ISN'T something to take lightly or casually. Having a child is one of the most significant ways an individual can change the world. Adding more humans to the world is a big deal.  We know that children of single mothers are more likely to commit crimes than children who grow up with their married parents. Also, given that there are so many religious nutjobs out there who refuse to get abortions, you end up with so many unwanted children with so many ill-equipped and incompetent parents that you're left with more awful people who fuck up life for the rest of us.

Agric. Food Chem., 2006, 54 (3), pp 843–847 DOI: 10.1021/jf0519818 Publication Date (Web): January 12, 2006  Abstract  By using a model reaction system representing blue-green discoloration that occurs when purees of onion (Allium cepa L.) and garlic (Allium sativum L.) are mixed, we isolated two pigment precursors (PPs) and a reddish-purple pigment (PUR-1) and determined their chemical structures. PPs were isolated from a heat-treated solution containing color developer (CD) and either l-valine or l-alanine, and their structures were determined as 2-(3,4-dimethylpyrrolyl)-3-methylbutanoic acid (PP−Val), and 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrolyl) propanoic acid (PP−Ala), respectively. Next, PUR-1 was isolated from a heat-treated solution containing PP−Val and allicin, and its structure was determined as (1E)-1-(1-((1S)-1-carboxy-2-methylpropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-prop-1-enylene-3-(1-((1S)-1-carboxy-2-methylpropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-ylidenium). The structure of PUR-1 suggested that PP molecules containing a 3,4-dimethyl pyrrole ring had been cross-linked by an allyl group of allicin to form conjugated pigments. While PUR-1 is a dipyrrole compound exhibiting a reddish-purple color, a color shift toward blue to green can be expected as the cross-linking reaction continues to form, for example, tri- or tetrapyrrole compounds.   Copyright © 2006 American Chemical Society  Translation: there are some chemicals in the garlic that, if conditions are just right/wrong, can result in blue green pigments being formed.

t5_2qjii,JasonMacker,1363252875,"I'm sorry but I'm going to have to agree with the Maoists on this one when they speak of oppressor nations and oppressed nations... referring to Chavez as a ""bourgeois nationalist"" is ignoring the material conditions of the third world. Chavez was an anti-imperialist and leftist. He also established good relations with many different nations, promoting anti-imperialist solidarity. Hardly a ""nationalist"", which really only makes sense when referring to first world nations in this context. Supporting oppressed nation sovereignty and independence is not ""bourgeois nationalism"", and I say this as a Luxemburgist, generally opposed to nationalism.  Chavez as not a communist, nor did he identify as Marxist, but he was a Bolivarian revolutionary and a comrade of the working class. What he did, and what all of his friends in other South American nations have done and continue to do, is make the case for the destruction of American hegemony and forging a new future for South American nations free of the tendrils of western imperialism. This is a significant development for the 21st century and shows that capitalism can still be pushed back and an alternative is possible.  He was not perfect but then again who is (besides Dear Leader Luxemburg, of course ☺)?  Chavez was a force for good in the world, and his successes (and errors) should not be dismissed or brushed off as ""bourgeois nationalism""... how ridiculous.",☺

t5_2qhwp,Boffosaurus,1363256237,"I hope never.  The series weakened towards the end, but I can't think of a single developer who wouldn't casualize the series to aim for a larger audience.  Gone would be the excessively wordy dialogue in favor of echoing ""Fuck You!""s.  It would most likely play just like God of War as well, which no one wants (or should want from the Legacy of Kain).  The controls could always be touched up of course, but, at least in Soul Reaver, there was something to be admired in the mechanic of having to use your environment to kill your enemies that was missing even in it's direct sequel.  I'd like to see how they could get that working in an updated engine but I fear that it would be highly scripted.  You dizzy them, a message tells you to GRAB THIS ENEMY.  When you do, all of the interactive objects in the zone glow to draw your attention and tells you THROW THE ENEMY ONTO A WALLSPIKE™.  I'd rather leave this series fondly nestled in the minds of the people who were lucky enough to experience it in an era when the industry raised pieces like it.  That's not to say we aren't still getting good games, but the time for the Legacy of Kain has passed and we need to let go.  There is no motivation for a publisher to bring it back besides hoping it's name is recognizable enough to sell a vaguely similar game to a new audience.",™

The last West Yorkshire derby was an odd affair because it had an ex-Town manager managing Leeds and an ex-Leeds manager managing Town, but Warnock showed us that he's still got it where it counts and I think there's a feeling of distinct unease about this coming weekend's return leg for that reason.

t5_2uxyh,rushone2009,1363262671,"OK buddy. First of we need more information, and while I'm here I'll help you out.  First of, is it a college? If so, how big? This matter because larger universities have very secure systems with multiple networks, meaning a lot of routers and hubs, server racks cloud protocols, VM's and databases. If you are at a large college, Wireless is distributed over a network with several steps for authentication, so a simply bruteforce attack or a handshake wont do.  If its a high school then you might be able to break their WPA. I recommend running a Linux distribution like Backtrack or Backbox or the recently released Kali Linux. Ten you might use the aircrack-ng suite of tools, or just try running wifite (google it)  You can find an aircrack tutorial on [my blog](http://rootbox.tumblr.com/wifi) or just Google it.  Now about Cygwin:  &gt;Cygwin is: &gt;a collection of tools which provide a Linux look and feel environment for Windows. &gt;a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API layer providing substantial Linux API functionality.  &gt;Cygwin is not: &gt;A way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows. &gt;A way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIX® functionality like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.  This is right on their site. Running Hydra is possible, but not necessary. I tend to avoid cygwin and advice you to do so also, because of its long install time, constant fuck ups and incompatibilities. If you want to hack, use Linux natively. Remove Winblows, and forget about it. That's really the only way to learn.  Oh and typing the default gateway into what? Hydra? That wont do much.

t5_2qq65,UncleTobys,1363262803,"**The NEAT™ Glass**  I can't be bothered giving everyone a breakdown of all the ""science"" and stuff behind the shape but you can go [here]( http://www.theneatglass.com/Home.html) for more info. I tried reading the [Nosing Science]( http://www.theneatglass.com/NosingScience.html) page but I almost fell asleep.   I bought this for $20.00 AUD. You can get it from the website for $18.95 USD. Yes, it's a bit pricey but I like trying new things and this thing looks pretty funny.  For the purpose of this exercise, I will be sampling **Ardbeg Alligator (51.2% ABV)** from a NEAT™ glass and a Glencairn. I'll let them sit for 10 or so minutes before nosing and tasting. My understanding is that this glass is supposed to reduce the alcohol burn when nosing in the *sweet spot* and bring out more/different scents. Let's see if they're full of it.  [Obligatory photo](http://i.imgur.com/t6bb6WI.jpg)  **Glencairn**  * Nose: Floral and peaty. BBQ smoke, charred oak, brine. Vanilla, light citrus and smoked paprika. Honeyed ham, dried bay leaves and sandalwood.  * Taste: Perfect mouthfeel - medium to full bodied, slightly oily and creamy. Meaty smokiness. Peppery and bittersweet. Barbequed meat and caramelised onion. Earthy peat and burnt wood. Ginger and citrus skin. Oaky vanillin and spice.  * Finish: Anise, clove and more pepper. Honey and sea salt. Smouldering peat bonfire. Faint coffee bitterness. Medium-long, medicinal and yummy.  Nothing much to add; I'm sure most of you have used a Glencairn before.  I must say that the Alligator is delicious! I think I'm starting to like it more than the Corry and Oog.  __________________________  **The NEAT™ Glass**  * Nose: Feels awkward because the shape makes it nearly impossible to stick my nose in the glass. WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT MY NOSE? After moving my nose around for a bit I think I've found the sweet spot.   Less prominent peat and smoke. Floral notes are more *flowery*. More well-defined vanilla, citrus and herb/spice. Meatiness is still there but you have to look for it.  I also picked up these additional notes: buttermilk, tea leaves, tobacco, marzipan,  dark chocolate, pine, nuts, olive oil and some vegetal qualities.  Because of the wider opening, I didn't get a blast of aromas and alcohol like from the narrow opening of a Gencairn. The alcohol burn is reduced significantly and the scents are more subtle. I had to work my olfactory system and it was quite challenging, but I really did pick up more notes. I could also nose this  CS whisky continuously without frying my nose.  * Taste: The flared lip feels funny but I got used to it, and it sort of spreads the whisky over the tongue. The taste is the same but also a bit different... it's difficult to explain.   * Finish: Same.  **Pros:**  * Less alcohol burn * Feels nice in the hand * More nosing notes   **Cons:**  * Less alcohol burn * Looks stupid * More subtle nose  **Conclusion:**   This glass is pretty [neat.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jgvNqNKJ5Q) It's the perfect compromise between a Glencairn and a tumbler - you can cup it with your hand and add ice more easily, while still being able to nose the whisky. If you don't like alcohol burning your nose this glass will be perfect for you.  Because I'm a sadist, I still prefer a Glencairn for the explosion of alcohol and smells, but I did get more nosing notes with The NEAT™ Glass. I'm still undecided as to which one I like more.  If you have 20 bucks lying around and you want to try a glass that's not a copita, tumbler or Glencairn, you should give this one a fair go.  **Edit: If you have neck problems you shouldn't buy this because you have to bend you neck back 90° to get that precious last drop.** ",™
t5_2qhbp,Logical1ty,1363263271,"One of the posters in the ex Muslim subreddit said these were his friends and they couldn't possibly do such a thing.  As for the behavior of reddit's atheists with regards to women, I'm sure everyone remembers this:  http://skepchick.org/2011/12/reddit-makes-me-hate-atheists/  Dawkins has made controversial misogynistic statements before too.  http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2011/07/richard-dawkins-draws-feminist-wrath-over-sexual-harassment-comments/39637/  If you Google ""atheism misogyny"" you'll run into a ton of articles (by atheists) talking about whether the 'New Atheists' movement ought to be associated with misogyny. At this point it just isn't fair of us to expect respect for women from them when even other atheists do not. It's okay to harass women if your intention is to ""challenge their beliefs"", a sacred duty undertaken by the brave™ knights of New Atheism.  Though we should probably thank God, there would be a lot more atheists today if it weren't for the likes of Dawkins and his ilk.  &gt; he said incest is fine as long as the brother wears a condom before having sex with his sister.

t5_2rxrw,mludd,1363267316,"&gt;And I can't stand it when 25+ men do a shit ton of drugs. I personally feel like you should get the wild stuff out of your system by then. I would never take a man seriously who had a ton of pictures of him rolling with 18 year old candi girls on his arm. Or a man who left his weed out on the coffee table for everyone and their mother to see.   While I understand that leaving a bunch of weed on the table or dating 18 year-olds when you're over 25 may seem off-putting I'm a bit curious about the whole ""should get the wild stuff out of your system by then"" bit.  What if he was one of those guys who were seriously responsible at an early age, i.e. didn't party his brains out from age 14 all the way through college and now that he's got a degree and a job he feels like it might be time to do all that partying (perhaps he feels like he missed out when he was younger, perhaps he was that bullied kid who was good in school but never got invited to parties in HS and it took most of his college years just to catch up to everyone else socially since he was essentially forcefully left behind in HS).  Now, I'm not saying I'm one of those guys, I'd say I did some of my hardest partying in my teen and college years actually but I just felt it came out a bit too black and white. Of course, I also have some serious issues with this faux maturity thing that hits a lot of people in their twenties (when suddenly they try way too hard to act like Real Proper Adults® and make a big deal about how they **Never** drink anymore, how they're *too* *old* for weed, how they rush into a mortgage with someone they started dating five months ago and all that)...",®

Most people will recommend running your first play through of the trilogy as is, making your actions have real consequences. Only you know how important that is to you, if you really want to get into 3 with him alive go ahead and do it over again. ME3 is completely playable and beatable without Mordin Solus.  &gt;  Second, should i download the citadel dlc before or after i finish the game?

Stand up now, stand up now.  Your houses they pull down, stand up now, stand up now, Your houses they pull down, stand up now; Your houses they pull down to fright poor men in town, But the Gentry must come down, and the poor shall wear the crown. Stand up now, Diggers all!  With spades and hoes and plowes, stand up now, stand up now, With spades and hoes and plowes, stand up now; Your freedom to uphold, seeing Cavaliers are bold To kill you if they could, and rights from you withhold. Stand up now, Diggers all!  Their self-will is their law, stand up now, stand up now, Their self-will is their law, stand up now; Since tyranny came in, they count it now no sin To make a gaol a gin, to starve poor men therein. Stand up now, stand up now.  The Gentry are all round, stand up now, stand up now, The Gentry are all round, stand up now; The Gentry are all round, on each side they are found, Their wisdom's so profound to cheat us of our ground. Stand up now, stand up now.  The Lawyers they conjoin, stand up now, stand up now, The Lawyers they conjoin, stand up now; To arrest you they advise, such fury they devise, The devil in them lies, and hath blinded both their eyes. Stand up now, stand up now.  The Clergy they come in, stand up now, stand up now, The Clergy they come in, stand up now; The Clergy they come in, and say it is a sin That we should now begin our freedom for to win. Stand up now, Diggers all!  The tithes they yet will have, stand up now, stand up now, The tithes they yet will have, stand up now; The tithes they yet will have, and Lawyers their fees crave, And this they say is brave, to make the poor their slave. Stand up now, Diggers all!  'Gainst Lawyers and 'gainst Priests, stand up now, stand up now, 'Gainst Lawyers and 'gainst Priests, stand up now; For tyrants they are both, even flat against their oath, To grant us they are loath, free meat and drink and cloth. Stand up now, Diggers all!  The club is all their law, stand up now, stand up now, The club is all their law, stand up now; The club is all their law, to keep poor men in awe; But they no vision saw to maintain such a law. Stand up now, Diggers all!  The Cavaliers are foes, stand up now, stand up now, The Cavaliers are foes, stand up now; The Cavaliers are foes, themselves to disclose By verses, not in prose, to please the singing boys. Stand up now, Diggers all!  To conquer them by love, come in now, come in now, To conquer them by love, come in now; To conquer them by love, as it does you behove, For He is King above, no Power is like to Love.

t5_2qh1i,extrados,1363302680,"I know 3 ways to tie shoes, and of at least 1 other (the ""speed"" method; just never practiced it enough to ""know"" it).  Try one of these?  * ""Standard"" method - [starting knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/startknot.htm); make a loop next to the knot with one of the laces; wrap other lace around the base of that loop once; pass a bit of the wrapping lace through the space between the knot, loop, and wrapping lace. * Easy kid method - [starting knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/startknot.htm); make a loop next to the knot with BOTH laces; tie those loops into another overhand knot.  Makes the same as the ""standard"" knot but seems easier for some people to tie.  Knot site calls this one a [two loop knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/twoloopknot.htm). * Double-cinch - [starting knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/startknot.htm) ([double starting knot option](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/doublestartknot.htm) - pass around and through twice); cross the laces like you're going to make another starting knot, but only pass through a little loop of each lace instead of pulling them all the way through. (Looking at the site with the pictures I've linked from, appears this is called a [Freedom Knot™](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/freedomknot.htm))  With any one of those, you can also tie another starting knot with the laces afterwards for more secure laces (or if they're really long) which is usually called a [double knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/doubleknot.htm).

t5_2tl67,thelmick,1363304873,"Yes, we did exactly this. Last year we purchased a number of points, resale. After using our points we decided we wanted more, so we are closing next week on more points, again resale. Quellman says that you will end up with two contracts, however if you can get matching use years on both contracts, it will merge to one contract. From one of the resale sites:  &gt;If you have the same use year for all of your packages, you will have one ID card for all of them. If you have more than one use year, you will receive an ID card for each one  We didn't have a problem with two cards, but we did end up with the same use year on both contracts.   You can use your points through the RCI network as that is a third party company. There is a fee to trade points via RCI, but I think it's like $90 per trade. Again from one of the resale sites:   &gt;The Membership that you purchase through the reseller will not be eligible to use those Vacation Points to make reservations within the Concierge Collection, the Disney Collection or the Adventurer Collection. Those Vacation Points will instead be valid for reservations at Disney Vacation Club resorts, as well as for the RCI® exchanges, Club Cordial and Club Intrawest.  You mention you want to use your points at Disneyland, you'll only be able to use it at the villas, not the hotels at the Grand Californian.   One other thing to keep in mind, Disney is [raising the base point price](http://dvcnews.com/index.php/dvc-program/financial/2215-massive-price-increases-on-march-20) for all DVC properties by $30-$40 *per point* soon. This means reseller will be asking more money for their properties. So if you can find a way to all the points you want now, you'll probably save yourself a lot of money. A lot of the resellers have financing, you can you try to get it from your local bank.  When buying points, take into consideration the annual dues. They vary by property as does the price by point and the end date of the contract. Owning some properties just aren't worth it in my opinion. ",®

t5_2rnve,dwjackson,1363307291,"FreeNas Server With Max Ram  http://doc.freenas.org/index.php/Hardware_Recommendations  RAM The best way to get the most out of your FreeNAS® system is to install as much RAM as possible. If your RAM is limited, consider using UFS until you can afford better hardware. ZFS typically requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM in order to provide good performance. The more RAM, the better the performance, and the FreeNAS® Forums provide anecdotal evidence from users on how much performance is gained by adding more RAM. For systems with large disk capacity (greater than 6 TB), a general rule of thumb is 1 GB of RAM for every 1TB of storage. This post describes how RAM is used by ZFS. NOTE: by default, ZFS disables pre-fetching (caching) for systems containing less than 4 GB of usable RAM. Not using pre-fetching can greatly reduce performance. 4 GB of usable RAM is not the same thing as 4 GB installed RAM as the operating system resides in RAM. This means that the practical pre-fetching threshold is 6 GB, or 8 GB of installed RAM. You can still use ZFS with less RAM, but performance will be affected. If you plan to use ZFS deduplication, a general rule of thumb is 5 GB RAM per TB of storage to be deduplicated. If you use Active Directory with FreeNAS®, add an additional 2 GB of RAM for winbind's internal cache. If you are installing FreeNAS® on a headless system, disable the shared memory settings for the video card in the BIOS.",®

t5_2tduo,MsPrynne,1363318051,"&gt;whether (as someone with no direct experience of sexual assault) I should just avoid talking about this in the future.  The thing about this issue is that lots of people who *do* have that direct experience find these conversations - ""please don't trivialize rape,"" ""you're perpetuating rape culture when you say that,"" etc. - difficult and even triggering to have. It's also very easy for the person to dismiss the issue as Irrational Emotions™. I would argue that it's not just okay but necessary for people who haven't experienced sexual violence to be vocal advocates against rape culture when they encounter it, because they aren't as likely to be subject to being triggered and aren't quite as easy to dismiss.

Most people don't understand, the Second Amendment WAS NOT established to give us the ""privilege"" of owning guns. The Second Amendment was established in case the same thing happened to us as happened to Americans by the British, a tyrannical government. Our Second Amendment was made so that if we our government ever became tyrannical, we would have similar weapons to regain the control of the people as the government was using to suppress the people. The government is already one step ahead of us by requiring special licenses for certain guns which they use daily. Don't require us to have licenses if you aren't required to have them. The government should better maintain their own check systems on the people that get these rifles. Our innocent, law-abiding citizens, are being punished for things the crazy people are doing.

This is what I received in their reply e-mail:  ""Thank you for your interest in the clinical trial we are taking part in.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether an investigational Intrauterine Device (IUS) is safe and effective.  The IUS is called LNG20.  It has not been evaluated or approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In fact, this study will provide the FDA with the information it needs to evaluate and potentially approve LNG20.   ""An IUS is a birth control method that is placed into your uterus by a doctor. The IUS releases a small amount of hormone into the uterus every day for up to 5 years.  Currently on the market is a similar IUS that is FDA-approved called Mirena®.  If you are enrolled in the study, you will receive the LNG20 to use for birth control.""  This is NOT a study of Mirena, it is a study of a device, unevaluated and not yet FDA-approved, that is SIMILAR to Mirena.  Just FYI, in case that would change anyone's interest in participating.

It is being aired on Dubai One to the entire Middle East + North Africa, internationally online and is sponsored by Google, Google+ and YouTube. Two brothers from the United Arab Emirates are traveling 100% guided by social media tips we get fed. We call it ""#SocialTravel"": being led by locals, not guidebooks. As we wander into South Korea next week (Country 4 of 12), one of the sub-cultures I've made sure gets included is Starcraft.  On March 20th, we've invited Artosis, Wolf and Khaldor to host a sponsored Google+ Hangout and live YouTube stream for anybody and everybody to dialogue with the guys. The Hangout is endorsed by Google+ and is a great chance for the community to shine. In the spirit of PeetaPlanet, we hope that some of you who wish to see Korea in the future through the lens of Starcraft can get a clearer picture of what it's like from dedicated people that have made e-sports their lives. We will be taking any and all questions on Twitter with the hashtag #PeetaHangout and reading live comments on the YouTube stream. Here is the Google+ page URL:  Google+ http://google.com/+peetaplanet  YouTube Stream: LINK TBA on 3/20 at 3:30 KST  In addition, Wolf will be guiding us through his own perspective of Seoul for the network TV show. What would you like to see answered, and more importantly, what would you like to see broadcast to millions of people across the globe? What do you think the world should know about Starcraft or e-sports? What do you want to see in Korea from Wolf's perspective?  Cheers! PeetaPlanet™",™

The numbers you can find publicly with a Google search will show that there are +500 customers and +1000 Vblock installations of various scale patterns (Vblock System 300 and Vblock System 700) around the world. In a nutshell, the majority of VCE customers that get a Vblock order another Vblock... or two or three or many many more.   That might seem like a big number with lots of folks running a Vblock somewhere but if you are looking for those same folks here it might be a bit of a stretch even with the popularity of these humble forums.    Semi-mostly-formal AMA:   If anyone in the thread wants to talk to VCE customers that are consuming Vblock and VCE Support just ping me. Also, if you let me know if you are in a specific industry with unique concerns / requirements I'll find someone for you to talk to that is a bird of a feather.   The last thing I want is for someone to think that just because someone from VCE weighed in here that I think it answers the OP query. i.e. don't take it from me -- take it from someone that has operated a Vblock for greater than a year and can point out the pros, cons, and considerations they went in with vs. where their considerations are now.",™

t5_2qplv,raginghamster,1363383545,"More like anti-dogma. Against censorship, against materialistic notions and assumptions of ""good science"" based solely on scientific methodologies. Yes, it sounds absurd, and some proof cannot be indexed the same way as materialistic proof, nor can it usually be replicated in a controlled environment, and of course not all proof is equally true, but this doesn't mean the scientific community has to demonize Sheldrake's ideas.  If something about our universe cannot be explained, then we seek ways to explain it to the best of our scientific methods and instruments. Perhaps our instruments are simply not capable of explaining or measuring whatever phenomena Sheldrake so passionately describes. Perhaps creativity and ""absurd"" ideas are what moves science forward. Perhaps the Earth orbits the Sun...  This whole TED censorship thing couldn't possibly get any more ironic. Dogma is a strong word, and it certainty applies to ""believers"" of Sheldrake, the people that ""know"" he is right. Similar to the accusations against those who ""believe"" in a causal-materialistic reality. But I don't think people are angry because the video goes against dogmatic beliefs. People are angry because the TED team has decided what they deem is bad science. The question is, should that be be TED's job, or ours? Is Sheldrake not presenting a ""good"" idea? What makes an idea ""good""?  EDIT: I'd also like to add that the video title ""Science Delusion"" was a terrible decision. Some people are taking the talk as an attack against science, and I don't think this is the point of the talk at all. The talk questions the foundations of what makes good or useful science, and adds some unorthodox ideas to the scientific discussion. I'm not surprised TED took this down. I mean, ideas like Carl Jung's acausal connection principle of synchronicity, Sheldrake's morphogenetic fields, etc. DO NOT follow our model of logic or reality. But these ideas attempt to explain phenomena that exists here in our reality. I think crazy ideas are a great starting point in creatively addressing unexplainable phenomena that does not seem to follow the ""rules"" of physics, or time, or causal-relationships. I don't think we are there yet technologically to recognize and ""prove"" these events. But maybe one day we will. Or maybe all observations of such events are a COINCIDENCE™ proven by existing laws of science. Until that day comes censoring videos like this one will not help progress science into new realms of understanding.",™

t5_2cneq,thinkB4Uact,1363405638,"It seems that there are two main camps of thought on the right, social conservatives and fiscal conservatives, with some convergence between the two.  I find that many fiscal conservatives just find balanced budgets appealing and have bought the brand *fiscal conservative*™ marketed by the GOP.  If they looked at what each party does in relation to government spending and revenue, they'd come to a different conclusion than that the Republican party is the party of fiscal responsibility.  They'd see that Republicans are not against big government spending when it comes to starting wars, increasing the funding of the military, giving tax cuts to the rich, or providing subsidies to profitable businesses.  They are generally against spending when it comes to social welfare programs.  It's not that Republicans are the opposite of *tax and spend liberals*™, they like to spend too, but they don't like taxes, especially on the rich, and they value different functions of the government.    I wanted to point this out, because I don't like how people hide behind labels without elaborating or defending their positions while many of us simply respect them for it without sufficiently challenging the ideas that the labels are often used to support.  I think of myself as a class warrior liberal, but since I agree that we should balance our budget, omitting the other beliefs that I have, wouldn't that make me a fiscal conservative too?",™

t5_2fwo,kopkaas2000,1363430047,"It's very easy to overlook in the article that the problem he is referencing applies to paginating a 'newst item first' view. In that case, regardless of whether you order by a date field or by an incrementing counter, the insertion of a new comment on top of the list means that any scheme that relies on LIMIT N,N exclusively to handle paging is going to have issues, as described:  &gt; The last comment on their first page got pushed down by the new comment, and it became the 11th comment in the list. Now your page just looks sloppy ☹  I would say the author should be a bit more clear about the reverse chronological sorting, the 'DESC' in the stated SQL query is easy to overlook. Moreso for me because I think sorting comments like that is stupid.  Edit: as nevirin points out, even in proper chronological order, if comments are allowed to be deleted, any 'sliding window with an offset co-ordinate' scheme will fail at this. It doesn't even have anything to do with SQL. Take a fictional thread-safe array, let's say:      Array comments = [1,3,5,9,13,17]  Now let's say we want to page these comments with a window of 3. Starting page numbering at 0:      pagedata = comments [ (page*3) ... (2+page*3) ]  So now we have a thread that wants to display the first page (page=0), it will show comments[0::2], being [1,3,5]. Now another user/thread mutates the array. Let's say the author of comment-id 3 just noticed he had a goat porn site on the other tab of the screenshot he posted. The array is now      [ 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 ]  The original user clicks 'next', so he gets served comments[3..5], yielding [13, 17]. Comment 9 never showed up for him.  In case of deletes, you can work around this by flagging deleted comments as invalid/deleted instead of removing them from the collection. But insertion is still problematic if the pagination has to work backwards. ",☹

t5_2qi58,Riverboat_Gambler,1363449766,"&gt;No, that he is waving a banana at a black player. I don't see why this is difficult for you to understand.  It's not difficult to understand, I just don't believe it's true. You're saying he's waving it **at** black players, I'm saying he's bringing it to every match for a laugh and until proven otherwise I'm perfectly fine having that opinion. I don't like assuming people are racists when there really isn't any proof of it.  &gt;Probably under the influence of some beverage or other, Frank thought it would be a good laugh to parade the banana on the terraces at Maine Road. Frank was loaned the banana on condition that he provided proof that he had taken it to the game.  So, err, the special case is that he's drunk and knows someone with an inflatable banana? Wow, yeah, could see how that's completely different from whoever else chooses to bring an inflatable piece of fruit. Did ManCity have any black players at the time? In that case their racism is built upon an original racist showing from a fan, not exactly admirable or a good excuse. I somehow knew you'd make excuses for English fans, though. It's *different* then, having a laugh is allowed because you lend them more credibility than you do Italian fans. There's no reason you should infer any more racism from the Inter fan than the (original and the subsequent) ManCity fan(s), but you do.  &gt;This is a complete non-point, because I explain immediately after what is important. This is effectively an attempted ad-hominem.  Some cheek bringing up ad-hominem. I'm a racist defending other racists, remember?  &gt;This is where you show yourself up to be a complete bigot. Should we never fight for the things that are right, just because nobody speaks up?  This is where you show yourself up as a complete idiot with no internal logic to your arguments whatsoever. You can't say that the only relevant thoughts on the matter are brought up by black players before arguing your case despite not being a black player, and then accuse me of being a bigot because I don't agree with you, DESPITE not having any substantial quotes from black players on the matter. You can pretend Balotelli is extremely afraid of inflatable bananas, not daring to speak up against this unspeakable horror, but somehow I don't think so.  &gt;Again, this makes no sense. YOU DON'T WAVE BANANAS AT FOOTBALL MATCHES WHEN BLACK PLAYERS ARE PLAYING.  Except if you're from Manchester, because then it's a Certified Laugh™ and therefore allowed. Those pesky foreigners aren't allowed the same benefit of the banter doubt.",™

You lost me in the first sentence. ""Skepticism"" does NOT need any of those things, since it's not a ""movement"" like environmentalism or Christianity but rather an epistemological attitude that's available to anyone without a litmus test. The concept of ""skepticism"" would suffer from being highly associated with some kind of centralized authority, since that reinforces the whole system of polarizing and exclusive ingroup/outgroup, ""I'm a Real Skeptic™""-style discussion.  You should take a step back and ask whether conceptualizing skepticism as a movement is really the most productive way to think about it, in terms of what sorts of change you want to effect in the world around you.  EDIT: Reading lightly through the rest of your essay, I got to ""If we as a movement hope to continue on the path to intellectual world domination"" as what may or may not be a sarcastic expression of your personal aims. If you're serious about this, I would want you to honestly ask yourself whether this is really a good goal, what it would mean for skepticism ""as a movement"" to be something that could ""dominate"" existing worldviews, and whether that's any fucking different than some kind of insane cult.",™

What about fidelity?   https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/index-funds/overview  &gt; Index funds attempt to track the performance of a particular stock or bond index, such as the S&amp;P 500® Index or the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, by holding most or all of the securities that are included in that index.  I think the keyword there is ""most"".    &gt; Yes, there are overly engineered ETF products that people might call index funds.  You mean there are index funds out there that do not own every security in the index they track?  Gosh, why didn't you just say so to start with.  That would have saved us a lot of time.     And they are not even ""overly engineered"";  it's just some portfolio manager sampling / weighting slightly different than the index he is trying to track.  Again, tracking error is what is used to measure how well an index fund compares to its benchmark.  If a security is costly to own or is illiquid, a manager might very well have a lower tracking error by not owning the company.   Do you get this through your thick skull yet?  Not every index fund owns 100% of the companies in the index it tracks.  ",®

t5_2qh1i,maria_stk,1363476369,"So since you actually read my comment and are considering this here's a lil more advise...  1. Just because certain things might work for other people doesn't mean those certain things will work for you. If it doesn't feel right or doesn't make sense to you, you don't have to force yourself to try/believe things you read or people say. For example...you read a book and there's tons of suggestions to get your life back on track you don't have to try do everything...Do what makes sense to you.  2. Some book suggestions:  'Awaken the Giant Within' by Tony Robbins  'How to Make Friends and Influence People' by Dale Carnegie (not necessarily about depression but definitely a great book that can change your life and help you understand human nature)  '7 Habits of Highly Effective People' (forgot author..my bad...just started reading it though and I think it's great)   3. Some motivation..I was depressed. No longer depressed and can confidently say I understand my emotions enough that it would be impossible for me to get into that state ever again (depressing shit has happened in my life since that time that could easily have got me back into that spiral [dad got really sick] and although it was obviously an extremely sad time the sadness of the situation didn't consume my life...I'm mentioning this cuz I know when your in a depressed state happiness can seem absolutely hopeless.   4. Do what you said you would. Research for sure. It's how I chose my books...especially one review in particular from amazon about the tony robbins book...the review made me buy the book and I'm extremely glad I did :p   5. I'm so excited for you :p All the power to you and good luck with everything ☺",☺

t5_2qh2s,daren_sf,1363477690,"It all starts with naked movement:    The low end: little movement.   The high end: lots of movement.   (Example: pugilists thru whirling dervishes.)  Then layer on fighting:   The low end: lots of damage.   The high end: little damage.   (Example: A level 1 character standing still in one spot will be able to deliver more damage than a character whirling around in the same spot can over time.)  Then layer on clothes:   The low end: padded and dense.   The high end: loose and flowing.   (Armor: spiked thru razor sharp tassels.)  Then layer on weapons:   The low end: increase range/damage/speed.   The high end: decrease range, increase damage/speed   (Weapons: projectile weapons thru bombs/mines.)  Here's a more detailed article: [Martial Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_art).  You're starting to get a lot of variety with just a couple points to consider.   Here's some play:   The [Testudines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testudines) are a nobel clan from the North. Known for their heartiness and patience, they're also well-versed in the art of concealment. Unparalleled in adverse conditions combat they'll surprise you more than you surprise them. (Fun Historical Fact: It's thought that the appearance of Testudines, with v1 of their now infamous 'pea shooters'**, in the 4th Ming War directly contributed to the dishonorable suicide of General Xaig.)  The [Cymric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymric_(cat)) Clan from the Isle of Man take more than their name from the indigenous felines. Long known for their grace and balance they prefer chained sticks (that extended no less!) and their 'mother's rings'*** in combat. (Fun Historical Fact: Soon Hoon's mother's ring is still wrapped around and through the orbital socket of Chan Xi's skull from the 2nd Ming War. Proudly still on display in the Hoon family museum.)  The [Rheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Rhea) Clan from the South are as vibrant and joyful in life as they are during combat. Favoring bright and tight clothing that's been known to secret bolos, rods and 'foot fan'**** the Rheas laughing smile has been the last visage of many a warrior. (Fun Historical Fact: The left foot fan of El Milase is still embedded in the base of General Zang's statute in Tiananmen Square with a bit of General Zang. Widely believed to be the start of the 3rd Ming War.)  The Clan of [Patagona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagona_gigas) is fiercely secretive. Always dressed to blend into their surroundings they can literally be any where or any one. With their uncanny ability to accurately drop (and avoid) mini-mines during combat give opponents a choice of moving and dying or not moving and dying. Their clothes are their weapons and their hand weapons are feared, and for good reason. It's believed that their dreaded finger blades have been replaced 'whiskers'*****.  ** Pea Shooter v1: 100m projectile weapon with armor piercing 1d4 rounds. 100 round/magazine. Most combat turns will allow 1 shot but due to a 'malfunction' in the v1 series occasionally 2 shots could be fired. The refinement of that malfunction made them infamous.  *** Mother's Ring: A stone of unknown origin with the family crest etched into it on a 6–12"" retractable chain attached to a ring foundation. The stone is twice as dense as normal stone and cannot be further modified. Only Calliese, the Cymric Mother, knew where they came from or how to modify them and she died whilst being tortured for that knowledge. Cymric Claws eventually became known as Mother's Rings in remembrance.   **** Foot Fan: An intricate, light weight metal fan embedded in the sole of a shoe. Using centripetal force during a kick it can fan out (in almost any shape) to deliver a cutting edge that's usually poisoned.  ***** Whiskers: Because 12"" FlexSteel™ finger blades weren't deadly enough, battle casualties are showing signs of deeper, more precise cuts (in those pieces that were big enough to ID such a laceration).

Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers because it increases uterine tone and contractions in pregnancy which may cause partial or complete abortions, and because its use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects.[31][32]  (From Wikipedia)  THIS SHIT IS USED TO INDUCE LABOR ALL THE DAMN TIME, even AFTER the manufacturer sent out specific notes that it was NOT to be used that way.   Don't think it happens?  It was used ON ME and guess what?  I had what they call a ""window"" in my uterus during my next birth.  That was in 2007.    Here is a link to the label, which CLEARLY states that it's not to be used on pregnant women.  It is an ULCER drug.   EDIT: they sent this letter out in 2001, so yeah, it was known for 6 years by the time it was used on me.  Searle, the manufacturer of Cytotec® sent all physicians a Drug Alert (also called a ""Dear Doctor letter"") in August of 2001,  warning that Cytotec® may cause uterine rupture, and recommending against its use for induction of labor.",®

t5_2qi79,How_Does_One_Reddit,1363499255,"The tributes are made in Indonesia but have all American parts. Legacy has vintage style pickups and the S-500 has the MFD Pickups.  &gt;The G&amp;L Magnetic Field Design® pickups use a ceramic bar magnet installed underneath each coil, with soft iron adjustable pole pieces to transfer the magnetic field to the top of the pickup. By contrast, traditional Alnico type pickups, such as used in the Legacy model, use non-adjustable Alnico pole pieces leaving the only adjustment being pickup height. The Magnetic Field Design has this adjustment, but further offers individual adjustment of each pole piece, letting the player effectively adjust the output of each string on each pickup. Magnetic Field Design yield about twice the output per wind, making the pickup quieter while allowing a greater overall output. The sound of Magnetic Field pickups is slightly warmer with a broader frequency response.  The S-500 also has a mini toggle that allows for all three pickups to be on at once. Both the Legacy and the S-500 have PGS demos",®

UDK is really expansive as there is alot to everyone.  That being said, if you want to make a game using UDK, I recommend going over the interface first. This helps out a lot because you don't know what functionality is at your fingertips until you find it.  Learn the rudimentary ways of setting up levels. How does Kismet improve workflow, and why is it useful? What about the design of a level and how to implement goals? If you want to make a brand new game, look to my next point.  After you know what the *editor* can do, learn to make it do what it can't. That is, make your own stuff for it. Creating custom actors, game rules, events, and scripts. This is done through UnrealScript, but you can learn it quickly.  One thing I should tell you: don't worry about art assets. You are the programmer, not the artist. Your art guy will take care of that crud for you. Don't be afraid to use the UT3 models for your game.   Resources to use:   * 3DBuzz offers a series on UDK   * Books:      * UDK™ Game Development ( Print ISBN-10: 1-4354-6018-9 )     * Unreal Development Kit 3 ( Print ISBN-13: 978-1-84969-052-2 )     * Unreal Development Kit Game Design Cookbook ( Print ISBN-13: 978-1-84969-180-2 )     * Unreal Development Kit Game Programming with UnrealScript ( Print ISBN-13: 978-1-84969-192-5 )     * UnrealScript Game Programming Cookbook ( Print ISBN-13: 978-1-84969-556-5 )  You actually have to get down and dirty and use UDK though. My approach when I learned it was:   * Make basic levels  * Add already existing scripting to basic levels   * Customize scripting a little ( movers, bombs, triggers )  * Fully customized scripting ( UnrealScript ) with new Pawns, Rules, etc.  Also, search for Dungeon Defenders. It's a game made using the UDK, it also has all it's Unrealscript open-sourced, so you can see how a real game, that made real mullah, did its work.  ",™

Before that point, however, they're nice as pie to the woman they're targeting, and tend to put her on a pedestal and heap compliments on her.   In a lot of cases, the women they are pursuing are already dating someone or married, but that doesn't stop Nice Guys™ from wanting them. Then they'll say stuff like, ""Well, if you were my girlfriend, I'd never treat you that way!"" when the woman's partner does anything they don't agree with. When the inevitable reject occurs, the Nice Guy™ immediately turns into a creeper and ramps it up to 11 and just gets disgusting.

t5_2s494,ilovefortlauderdale,1363551882,"Water Taxi firing shows perils of civic engagement Trying to save Fort Lauderdale tree, Chris Brennan loses his job  Michael Mayo Sun Sentinel Columnist  6:27 PM EDT, March 16, 2013  Truth be told, I don't care much about a big old rain tree in Fort Lauderdale that's stirring controversy because it might be moved — and perhaps mortally harmed — for a new condo development. If I cried for every fallen tree or lost patch of wetlands in South Florida, I'd be drowning in tears and antidepressants.  But I do care about the disturbing plight of Chris Brennan, who recently got fired from the Water Taxi for taking up for said tree.  The chilling lesson: Don't bother being civically engaged, because it can only lead to trouble.  ""That's why apathy has won in this state,"" Brennan, 33, told me Friday. ""If you try to speak out about something, you get squished.""  On Feb. 6, Brennan posted a YouTube video decrying the tree's proposed uprooting to make way for Marina Lofts, a three-tower, 1,000 condo development. The video rankled the developer, who also happens to be landlord of the Water Taxi's current base.  The developer, Asi Cymbal, got in touch with Brennan's boss. Brennan declined to take down the video.  On March 1, after nearly six years with Water Taxi, Brennan was fired. The company sent an email to his co-workers that read, ""Because Water Taxi is a tenant of Cymbal Development, Chris' actions are in conflict with the company's interest, and he was terminated."" His firing is perfectly legal. But it's also an outrage.  Is it any wonder so many people are leery about getting involved — or caring — about local issues? Is it any wonder we end up with local elections where only 8 percent of voters turn out?  We give a lot of lip service to personal liberty and freedom of speech in this country, but Brennan's story shows that workers are only as free as their bosses (or their associates) allow them to be. America has gone from ""Don't tread on me,"" to ""Tread carefully.""  ""As long as you're not under somebody's thumb economically, then you have freedom of speech,"" said Brennan. ""Otherwise, you have to be willing to lose your livelihood.""  I could understand getting canned if you worked at McDonald's and posted YouTube rants about the perils of Big Macs. But what Brennan did seems more tangential. If we all have to live and act based on what meshes with our employers' best interests – even on our own time – how does that differ from totalitarianism?  What happens if you want to stop a new nuclear plant near your home, but your employer does business with FPL? What happens if you oppose the expansion of casino gambling, but your company says new resorts could help its bottom line?  Brennan told me, ""I'm not a tree-hugger, and I'm not opposed to progress…I'm just a native with an appreciation of the past."" He said he's bothered by the disposable nature of promises, like a 1987 Fort Lauderdale commission resolution that supposedly protected the rain tree. About his video, Brennan said, ""It was tongue-in-cheek, but factual. I didn't find it to be that big of a threat to [Cymbal's] project."" Since his firing, Brennan has gotten a bartending job at Big Dog Station in Oakland Park, where his new boss supports his efforts.  ""I have no ill will toward Water Taxi,"" said Brennan, a Fort Lauderdale native who once worked as a Broward County park ranger. ""They had to do it…My boss had tears in his eyes when he let me go.""  Brennan blames Cymbal for putting the squeeze on Water Taxi, but Cymbal told my colleague Brittany Wallman he didn't request Brennan's firing. I wanted to talk to Cymbal about the situation, but he was out of the country and unavailable, according to the greeting on his cellphone. Brennan's firing might bring more attention to the tree and more opposition to the condo project.  But it comes at a steep personal price, one most workers aren't willing to pay.

I stopped pumping when he hit one year and they just started giving him cows milk at daycare. We still nursed when we were together, no problems. It was such a pleasure to stop pumping at work!  I love breast feeding; wouldn't have it any other way, but lets face it, pumping sucks :-P.   Now, I basically nurse him to sleep every night in his own bed, then at least one more time before morning.  Sometimes I'll nurse him when I get home from work, but not everyday. On the weekend, I nurse him a couple times a day, often down for his nap, and maybe once or twice more. You will figure it out; just do what works for you. Your body will adjust.   Nights out should be fine, but I can't really speak to that because I've never had one 😳. Never spent a night away from a nursling (I've had three), but I would image I'd pump if I did. ",😳

t5_2rb2y,movzx,1363577290,"I am not arguing the speed boost.  I am arguing the ""isNaN may be overwritten by someone"" justification.  Claiming that throwing an error or giving unexpected results because someone broke the core language is acting as a ""teaching tool"" is asinine.  It's not an obsession about wondering about shitty developers. It's pointing out that shitty developers exist and will be shitty regardless of you trying to avoid the basic language features in the language you work in. Hell, if anything  you're the one 'obsessed' because you're still trying to defend avoiding core language features because of the possibility that a shitty developer overwrites them.  If you think redefining core language functions is a-okay then by all means continue to replace every single piece of JavaScript with your own code that only uses primitives. Best to be safe!  Wouldn't want to get bug reports about String.match() not working in our library because some idiot developer decided it was best to overwrite it in theirs.  Hell, what is jQuery to do when someone defines the $ or jQuery? I think there should be an issue reported about using traditional ASCII for the object name. We need something that developers won't accidentally use. Maybe a frowny face ☹ because we're so sad about not being able to use the date libraries that already exist because someone, somewhere may have overwritten it.  This is a ridiculous point you are trying to make. I'm done. If you truly believe that redefining core language and not maintaining compatibility is an okay thing for someone to do then you're a bad programmer.",☹

t5_2s4k5,edit1754,1363584426,"Do you think you could tone down the site's use of marketing-style language a bit?  I was just looking at the page you have for the IdeaPad Y580, and *""Leading-edge displays. IdeaPad® Y580 boasts a 15.6″ LED backlit HD display for dazzling colors and rich contrasts.""* couldn't be more incorrect. The Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 comes with a 15.6"" 1366x768 display. 1366x768 resolution in a 15.6"" display makes things onscreen large, and 15.6"" displays that have 1366x768 resolution tend to be low-grade LCD panels with very poor image quality due to low contrast. This is a type of display that you should make a point to avoid when it is reasonable to do so, unless you require the larger text for eyesight related reasons.  The Lenovo IdeaPad used to be offered with two types of displays: That display, and a 15.6"" 1920x1080 display that was not only better in terms of resolution itself, but was also significantly better in contrast and quality. The Y580 was really only a good choice if you were to buy one of the models that came with the 1920x1080 display, and the fact that it's essentially no longer available with the 1920x1080 display has caused it to lose its rankings from the Quick Picks list in this subreddit, and as a recommendable choice in general. You shouldn't really be recommending the 1366x768-model Y580 on your site.  Your idea looks like it has potential though, and could become a great resource with a bit of work. Just throw out the Y580 listing, replace cases of marketing language with meaningful and truthful details, and maybe start listing a couple more models.",®

t5_2qm35,therantwork,1363606443,"Ăsta e un subiect pe care îl iubesc infinit de mult. Așa că mă lungesc. Dacă citiți, mă bucur :)  Am 23 de ani, locuiesc de 5 ani în București și merg în fiecare zi de lucru cu cel puțin patru ""mașini"" diferite. Sunt genul care dacă n-are abonament, are sigur bani de bilet pe cardul electronic. I've seen a lot of shit.  **CAPITOLUL I: CONTROALELE**  Din câte am observat, controalele în RATB se fac în 3 feluri: Raid, Ninja și Filtru.  *RAID*:  Controlul RAID este cel mai des întâlnit. Mașina oprește în stație, se urcă toată lumea, urcă și nemâncații de controlori, se închid ușile și, înainte ca cineva să aibă timp să se prindă de bare/să scoată cartela/să valideze/etc, abilii protectori ai transportului în comun blochează cititoarele și trec la inspectat.  Dacă n-ai apucat să validezi și n-ai abonament, ai belit metaforicul belengher. La abonament merge să nu validezi, nu-ți zice nimeni nimic dacă ai abonament și nu ai validat. Dacă ai Portofel Electonic^® și n-ai validat călătoria, începe scandalul.  Pe controlori nu-i interesează că abia ai urcat și n-ai apucat să validezi pentru că și-au băgat ei coada prea repede. Înep cu teorii de genul ""Dar era obligația dumneavoastră să validați. De când mergeți cu autobuzul?"" De parcă vechimea ""ca călător"" ar avea vreo relevanță cu faptul că sunt ei niște mârlani. Orice ai face, dacă ești prins, profesioniștii în controlul biletelor te vor lua la mișto.  *NINJA*:  Controlul NINJA este asemănător primului, însă este direcționat în special către cei care nu plătesc/validează.   Mașina oprește în stație, urcă lumea și controlorii, se închid ușile și se așteaptă. De obicei băieții așteaptă un minut-două și după aia acționează. Atunci ești mâncat. Nu mai ai nicio scuză că n-ai validat. Ai făcut vizibilă intenția ta de a nu plăti. Ai belit-o. Iei amendă sau te înțelegi.  It's super effective!  *FILTRU*: În ultimele două săptămâni, am întâlnit de cel puțin 5 ori controlul FILTRU. De obicei pe linia lui 336 sau 61, chiar înainte de Politehnica (este un centru medical Doris - chiar în dreptul lui. Cunoscătorii, probabil știu.)  Controlul FILTRU se face între stații. Se oprește mașina în dreptul unui grup de aproximativ mai mult de 10 controlori, se deschid ușile, controlorii urcă și se controlează rapid. Cei cu mâța în sac sunt dați jos, ușile se închid și mașina pleacă.  Acest gen de control este eficient, dar e exagerat. Să organizezi un flagrant, să lungești și mai mult o călătorie care deja merge ca ochiul mortului e de-a dreptul nesimțit. Dar, vigilența și eterna Corectitudine^® a controlorilor nu poate fi stârpită nici gând.  **CAPITOLUL II: CONTROLORII**  Controlorii sunt o specie care mă dezgustă. În calitate de călător corect, fac tot ce-mi stă în putință ca să mă fut în gura lor.   Nu validez niciodată abonamentul. Scot greu cardul când mă controlează. Îi privesc cu scârbă atunci când mă controlează și cu și mai multă scârbă când ""prind"" pe cineva și fac scandal. În situațiile (rare) în care am fost prins fără bilet (pentru că mai aveam 1.2 lei în loc de 1.3 lei și nu îmi valida călătoria sau îmi expirase abonamentul cu o zi în urmă, nu validasem dar aveam vreo 20 de lei pe card) am plăcerea sadică de a o face pe deșteptul cu ei.  Fac toate cele de mai sus, nu pentru că sunt un cocalar bulangiu (deși în situațiile alea pot fi perceput ca atare), ci pentru că EI sunt niște mizerii de oameni care abuzează de minuscula și neînsemnata putere învestită în funcția lor de căcat.  Controlorii controlează cu precădere tinerii sub 25 de ani. Apoi, ca preferință, merg după femeile până în 35, apoi bărbații până în 35. Ești, în mare, în siguranță dacă vârsta pe care ți-o trădează înfățișarea pare peste 40-45 de ani; atunci nu mai ești controlat pentru că poți fi pasibil de Pensionarism^® sau Veteranism^®.  Când începe controlul, jegul de om numit controlor te înghesuie într-un colț, îți ține baraj sau te se proptește lângă scaunul tău, ca și cum te-ar fi prins deja fără bilet. Cu un ton slinos și sigur pe sine, care sugerează că el te-a acuzat de neplată încă de când s-a urcat în mașina jegoasă în cauză, îți cere Legitimația de Călător^® și îți întinde timp de o fracțiune de secundă legitimație în aria generală a câmpului tău vizual. Niciodată n-am reținut numele vreunui specimen pentru că n-ai timp, fizic, să citești, darămite să reții.  După ce îți verifică datele, dacă ești în regulă, îți scuipă în silă plasticul înapoi și un ""mulțumesc"" atât de sictirit încât ai zice că i-ai făcut un deserviciu pentru că ai plătit.  Dacă NU ești în regulă, atunci începe distracția (de ambele părți).   Controlorii pot fi catalogați după două criterii. *II.1 După dotare* II.1.1 Clasi-controlorul  Are o cartelă electronică cu care blochează cititoarele. Ideal pentru controlurile RAID și FILTRU.  II.1.2 Inspector Gadget  Are un Smartfon^® pe Android care are pe spate cititor de carduri. Ideal pentru controlurile tip NINJA. De obicei este un specimen mai tânăr, pentru că boșorogii bașoldiți care verifică de dinainte de revoluție și-ar prinde urechile în tehnologie și sunt deja depășiți de cititoarele portocalii și electronice.  II.2 După suflet II.2.1 Soul Controller Este controlorul care te iartă, care te lasă în pace și care ""înțelege"" că ești tânăr, că și el a fost odată. Specimen RAR, dar existent în cel puțin 2 exemplare întâlnite de mine. N-am avut onoarea să fiu prins de un astfel de exemplar, dar am văzut pe alții cum s-au descurcat.  II.2.2 The Pack-controller  Lucrează în haită, te amendează, te dă jos. No escape. Controlorul cel mai des întâlnit.  II.2.3 Big-Mouth Face scandal ca să se facă remarcat. El este cel care provoacă o scenă pe care o agravează, acuzându-te că provoci o scenă. Plin de zel, nesimțit, care nu suportă să fie înduplecat de către martori. Ba mai mult, dacă cineva intervine (așa cum des se întâmplă), controlează și pe persoana care intervine, chiar dacă este un pensionar (important pentru un motiv pe care îl voi explica în continuare).  **CAPITOLUL III: RATB ÎN GENERAL**  Deși, pentru mine, RATB-ul este principalul mijloc de transport, îl urăsc atât de mult încât mi-am luat bicicletă ca să nu mai merg cu RATB-ul. Dar tot trebuie să merg cu RATB-ul pentru că nu merg iarna sau dacă e prea frig sau dacă plouă.   RATB-ul este un jeg. Un jeg mai mare decât jegoșii care îl conduc, la propriu și la figurat, care îl controlează și îl gestionează.   Dacă ar fi după mine, și aș fi eu, deodată manager la RATB, aș face următoarele chestii:  1. Aș scoate gratuitatea pentru pensionari și le-aș da aceeași reducere ca pentru studenți. Excepție ar fi doar pensiile abject de mici. Dar dacă ești un bășinos octogenar cu pensie cât salariul meu, nu cred că ar trebui să îți plimbi hoitul pe moca. În orice caz, și pensionarii ar fi obligați să aibă cartelă, pe care să o valideze. Dacă stai să te uiți, ma bine de 80% din călători sunt pensionari, deci nu plătesc. Dacă te uiți și mai bine, pensionarii sunt cei care comentează și se plâng cel mai des de autobuzele vechi și jegoase sau de aglomerație. În același timp, pensionarii au cele mai voluminoase bagaje pentru că marea majoritate fac naveta din Apusului până în Obor ca să ia ouă cu 10 bani mai ieftine (doar nu dau bani pe transport și timp au destul). Mulți pensionari cam put, ceea ce adaugă la izul putred de transpirație stătută pe care îl au mașinile publice în general. Tot pensionarii au pretenții la scaune. Ei te ridică de jos ca să stea ei, ei se împing în tine dacă nu te dai, ei sunt cu gura mare și tot ei nu plătesc. Și cu pula-n gură și cu sufletu-n rai nu se poate.  2. Aș face obligatorie intrarea pe la ușile din față și coborârea pe la mijloc. Așa e civilizat și nu mai trebuie să te rogi de toți căcănarii surzi ca să se dea dracului la o parte, doar să te întâlnești cu gloata care a urcat deja și s-a făcut ca sardinele. Câte coborâri n-am ratat din cauza cretinătăților de genul ăsta. Mai mult, aș face taxarea în stație - ca la metrou, cu turnicheți. Stația să fie o clădire închisă în dreptul căreia să se oprească autobuzele, oamenii validează, intră, așteaptă mașina și se urcă. Aș suplimenta numărul autobuzelor (din banii obținuți prin taxarea tuturor călătorilor) și, așa, s-ar reduce aglomerația.  3. Aș încerca să fac transportul gratuit, susținut din fonduri publice și publicitate. Nu mi se pare normal să dau bani și să îmi fie servită și publicitate. Nici în RATB, nici la Metrou. Se învârt bani grei în spațiile de publicitate out-of-home, deci s-ar putea susține gratuitatea prin transformarea tuturor spațiilor RATB (mașini noi și vechi, stații, cartele, bonuri, coșmelii etc.) în spații publicitare. It's free, but at a price.  4. Aș controla la sânge performanțele șoferilor. Unii conduc de parcă ar căra cartofi. Alții se mișcă mai pohales. Unii opresc în intersecții mari, chiar dacă e verde, dar semaforul de la pietoni pâlpâie pe verde, ceea ce indică că se va face roșu și la mașini în următoarele 20 de secunde; și nici măcar nu e aglomerat. Nu i-aș mai lăsa să asculte radio/muzică în cabina lor. Dacă vorbesc la telefon fără hands-free, -25% din salar per incident și abonament de o săptămână gratis pentru călători. Dacă folosesc hands-free și zbiară ca niște troglodiți sau discută despre niște chestii care pe nimeni nu interesează, același tratament.  5. Aș introduce o persoană care acționează ca un OPC în fiecare stație/mașină. Această persoană ar alunga boschetarii mirositori și ar da jos țiganii care se comportă ca în cort. Dacă ești cocalar și ești dat jos, poate înveți o lecție.  6. Aer condiționat în toate mașinile, inclusiv alea vechi.  7. Reînnoirea completă a parcului cu mașini noi. Accentul se pune pe capacitatea totală (jos+în picioare) și confort, nu pe firmă.  Aș mai avea multe de zis :)",®

Now i'm curious, could Sakura develop a concentrated solution of the protein? Isolating the gene, inserting into bacteria, taking the product and making ""HASHI'S POWER DRINK™"".

t5_2qh1i,bast58,1363630379,"Hey Elfe,  Here's some help for you:  1.  Favorite poem: Song of Myself from Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman. (Although Desiderata by Max Ehrmann is a very close second).  2. first heard:  11th grade English - probably have reread it 4x a year every year since then (I graduated high school in 1976  - you do the math, but that's a fair number of years.)  3. From near the end - ""I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable. I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  The last scud of day holds back for me, It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds, It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.   I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,  I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.  I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,  If you want me again look for me under you boot-soles.  You will hardly know how I am or what I mean. But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood.  Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, Missing me on place search another,  I stop someplace waiting for you.""  Walt Whitman   Too me this is the image of approaching death with a life well-lived, fully-lived, ready to take the next adventure.  4. Read it often?  Yes  Why?  It adds depth and beauty, illumination and joy to my life.  It gives me understanding - It helps me know others have the same questions, same misgivings, same hopes, same dreams, same fears.  It makes me feel a part of the larger world of humanity.  5.  Make more accessible?  Most people love poetry - they just don't think it is poetry.  Got any favorite music?  Know all the words by heart?  Guess what - That is a poem set to music.   If I were teaching - I'd teach the lyrics (the poetry of the song) and then have students analyze how the music impacts the meaning of the lyric (poem).  Also - I think great quotes from great poems are excellent ways to help people learn to love poetry.  I'd have a quote on the board everyday and talk about what it means - and why it means different things to different people.   Suddenly it is evident in sitcoms, movies, and even current music.  Efie - I hope this helps.  Read Song of Myself, Read Desiderata  - in fact, here is Desiderata:  Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927   ",©

t5_2qhbe,Rossco1337,1363632233,"Most education institutes are great at running these rackets. Books, software, whatever they're teaching you, they're guaranteed to be making a big margin on it. I hear in America they require you to buy a specific edition of a specific book (which can run up to $140 per copy) to teach a class. Then the publishers pay the professors and everyone's happy apart from those broke suckers with the soon-to-be-obsolete books. Copies and electronic versions not allowed because that's cheating.  I have a friend who's taking an Adobe Class® for something to put on a CV. The class only exists because Adobe is paying the college for it. Of course, all the students have to pay out their own pockets on top of the class for all the software they need to buy. It's the same thing with Office; everyone gets taught how to use MS standards so *everything else* looks weird and broken and they'll take that opinion to work with them. At least with operating systems there's some competition because Apple wants their computers in schools too. It's not about education, it's simply who can pay them more to teach their doctrines so the money will come back to them when they get a job.  No matter how good free software is, it will never be taught in schools. Free can't compete with large subsidies and kickbacks. Maybe when you get to the ""five figure grant"" stage you can get some unbiased education.",®

Roughly 54 percent of those sales have been of digital versions of the game, downloaded directly to players’ PCs via Origin™ or other digital download services.  &gt;“SimCity had a great weekend with sales strong across both North America and Europe, adding to overwhelming demand at launch that has us tracking well beyond expectations for the game,” said Peter Moore, Chief Operating Officer for EA. “SimCity is one of the storied brands in gaming, and Maxis delivered a game re-envisioned and engineered for the online age.”  &gt;Gamers have logged on to SimCity via Origin in record numbers, with 44 percent of SimCity sales delivered via EA’s direct-to-consumer digital download service. SimCity gamers have also helped set new records for peak concurrent users on Origin, now at 1.3 million and rising.  &gt;In just two weeks:  &gt;SimCity players have logged more than 15 million hours of online gameplay. &gt;More than 5.7 million original cities have been created since launch. &gt;More than 780 million buildings have been built. &gt;SimCity mayors to date have built enough road and railroad tracks to circle the globe more than 40,000 times.  &gt;The Maxis™ studio also continues to enhance both the core SimCity game and the online service infrastructure; in the last two weeks, they have increased server capacity by more than 400%, optimized server response times by 40 times, and deployed fixes to address players' direct feedback on game performance.  &gt;Everything is intelligently simulated in this new SimCity, from all of the Sims in a city, to every kilowatt of power pulsing through a region thanks to the powerful GlassBox Engine. It is the most expansive city management game yet where multi-city gameplay across regions delivers a larger playing field. No longer are players relegated to playing one single city, now they can manage and play up to 16 cities at once. Each city can have different specializations; they can share services and trade resources; they can help or even hinder each other; every decision a player makes in each city has impact in the broader region. It’s up to the player to decide where and how they play.  &gt;For the first time in the series multiplayer is added to the gameplay giving players a new dimension to the game, as decisions impact both the city and the region, creating new ways to play by collaborating or competing to earn achievements. Underpinning SimCity is a live service that simulates real-time updates and pushes them to players in the form of new challenges and achievements. Players will track their progression alongside their friends and the world for the most polluted city, the richest city and more. Whether players play by themselves, with their friends or with the rest of the world, SimCity will challenge players to create the city of their dreams and answer the question – what kind of mayor will you be?  &gt;SimCity is available now worldwide on PC via Origin and retail stores.

t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1363649357,"&gt;I'm an economist, and I could bullshit about how you need to take courses in dynamic programming and master MATLAB before you can pretend to talk knowledgeably about fiscal stimulus, but I don't because I recognize that this would just be an unproductively defensive assertion of authority.  Fair enough, and a good point. Maybe if I were teaching, I would know more about how to confer knowledge without being literally so obtuse. But, then again, I don't pretend to give an informed opinion about fiscal stimulus without having the requisite knowledge. In fact, I don't attempt to opine on topics outside of my field generally, which is why I am here trailing away from a conversation about eugenics instead of in /r/politics suggesting my *two step plan to solve the economy™*.   &gt;And if people asked me for sources on these issues, I would give them (or at least admit to being too lazy to dig up the proper references.) Because they do in fact exist, are reasonably approachable, and I would expect anyone who claims to know what they're talking about to be familiar with them.   False Metaphor, I don't ask you to explain to me the proof for the fundamentals of econometrics for the same reason that it is ridiculous for you to be asking me for a source regarding the entire history of both population genetics and genetic engineering. And your derisively stated expectation belies the fundamental difference between our knowledge sets on this topic.  For not constructing my own summary document of the world of genetics to this point in history, I can say that I am sorry. I am lazy. YOLO  &gt;but I guess I need a Biomedical Engineering degree first.   Of course you are familiar with it, everyone is, you just probably aren't accustomed to thinking about it in a Biological context. But no, a Biological Systems Engineering or Bioinformatics degree would probably be fine. It's not ""being obtuse"" to state that there are years of rigorous classes in all fields of Science and Engineering before getting to the discussion of biological engineering, let alone genetic engineering. I'm sorry if it seems that way to you, but if you have a real interest in the field, I would actually suggest that you start with the in depth fundamentals of biology and work your way up.   With the fourth straw man and accusations of being obtuse because I won't explain the core assumptions of my field any more than those explanations which I have given you three times, I am just going to go ahead and stop responding after this message. I wish you well.   ",™

Boy eats good and is strong and healthy. I looked EXACTLY the same at his age and was also active in soccer and baseball. I lost the baby fat and the rest of the weight at puberty and grew to 6'4"" and a solid 240-250 lbs.

BF3 multiplayer without DLC is alright but you could just buy the premium version of the game that comes with vanilla for free at the same cost as buying premium for all of the DLC.  Plants vs. Zombies is super cheap, they were even giving it away for free sometime last fall/winter.  Why get an older version of SimCity when you have the newest one?  Bejeweled 3 is pretty old now and is probably as cheap/free as Plants vs. Zombies.  MoH Warfighter was originally one of the ones I'd say you should get but I just really liked the story, personally... ♥Dusty. Single player plays like a CoD clone and the multiplayer is so-so.",♥

t5_2qh1i,sunnynook,1363688777,"[Desiderata](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gongsu/desiderata_textonly.html)   -Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy. © Max Ehrmann 1927 ",©

Maybe I'm wrong, and perhaps this was a group opeartion, and there were 17 players behind that fleet. If you were involved in that fleet, please tell us.  But that encounter raises the question: how far is too far? Should we allow players to use the game mechanics to that extent?

t5_2qh13,Atlai,1363704325,"&gt;That was the most cynical and human unfriendly claim I've read today. What kind of twisted view upon humanity do you have?  Cynical? Human unfriendly? There are a lot of [shitty jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Jobs) that need to be done for modern society to function, whether you like it or not. It's a fact. The market decides what these jobs are. This is not monetary thinking. This is humans deciding that something is useful to them. People are needed to dump rotting meat into a reclamation machine to make usable products out of waste. Do you think they *like* going home smelling like rotting flesh all day? No, but someone is willing to pay them enough that they think it's worth it to do.  If your job happens to be fun to you, then good for you. I like my job, but it's not always great to do. Sometimes it really sucks.  &gt;Today there are plenty of completely unnecessary ""jobs"" which are neither fun nor are making the society do any kind of progress.  This is childish and naive thinking. You may think that they are not doing anything for society, but society has decided these jobs are necessary by deciding to pay the workers for them. If these jobs were deemed unnecessary, then the companies would get rid of them (like how they did with all the unnecessary tech support or phone sales jobs in the US and outsource them). Furthermore, if you think yourself a worthy judge of what jobs are necessary and not, you fall into the trap of the USSR. Society has determined organically through the market that these shitty jobs are necessary for society to function. You can't tell society what it needs or wants.  &gt;Those jobs which are not fun those we may consider being unnecessery, thus abolishing.  &gt;Those jobs which are not fun those we may consider being unnecessery, thus abolishing.  You can abolish all the shitty jobs you want, eventually, but the companies are only going to switch to robots and AI when society decides through the market that it's cheaper to have robots and AI do those jobs. As long as its cheaper to have humans do it, humans will do it.  &gt;Those jobs which are too heavy or too boring for people to do, there you can find plenty of people (like me) who are keen on automatizing those kind of jobs with artificial intelligence and smart machinery. That is fun❣  I'm perfectly okay with making shitty jobs automated by technology, but it's completely naive to think that we can do that with every job today. Society is not to that point yet, even if we can see it coming. The way the world works today, we have to work and it may not be something we want to do, and that's okay. Plenty of people have to make much tougher decisions than whether they want to clean out grease traps for $8/hour, and it's important to put that into perspective when 780 million people don't even have access to clean water in this world.

t5_2ug10,Comrade_Klim,1363706521,"Let me preface this by saying I am not an LEO. I’m just a fellow Masshole who might have some useful insight for you. I’m not going to touch on question #3 because it would be best answered by someone with experience in those fields.   While I wouldn’t say a CJ degree is worthless, I don’t think that it is the best path to get a job in law enforcement. Also, you’re 19 so don’t commit yourself to a path that offers such narrow possibilities in the future. I am 22 and in May I will graduate from UMass Amherst with BBA in management. I started out thinking that I wanted to be an accountant but after a few years of classes and an internship I knew it wasn’t the right career for me. I switched to management because I enjoyed the aspects of working with people and public speaking, presenting, etc. I hope some of those skills will transfer to a career in LE.   What I am saying is that you should pick something you think you will enjoy and take some classes to get a feel for what you like (start out at community college if you don’t want to pay crazy tuition at some of the Boston schools). Do internships, they are the only way you can actually experience a portion of what you will be doing on the job. Hopefully you will find something you enjoy and stick with it.   If you really want to do CJ, take a look at Northeastern. I was accepted to their CJ program in 2008 but decided not to go after discussing career possibilities with their dean.  From what I understand it is a pretty good school for that degree. The upsides to NEU are that it is close to you and they set you up with internships between your second and third year IIRC.   Your separation from the military shouldn’t adversely affect your background check for LE, as long as you are open and honest about it. It will be a non-issue for nursing unless you’re trying to go ROTC. Then they may not accept you because of your medical history. You would really have to talk to the PMS of whichever school you decide on to know for sure.  As a side note is very hard to get an LE job in MA without having veteran status. Not to say you shouldn’t try, but apply everywhere you can and never put all your eggs in one basket.   Nursing is a great career field. My girlfriend is in her junior year of nursing at UMass and they have an outstanding program. The only downside is that you have to commit to it early on. Aside from a few GEN ED classes they only experience medical classes. Their degree is very structured and leaves no room to try anything but nursing. After their second year, nursing students start clinicals and most of their time is spent practicing in hospitals or in home care. If you start nursing be certain that you want to see it through or you might end up having to start over with just a few transferable credits.  If I were you, I would also take the next NYPD test offered. Its quite easy if you look at their study guide. You can take the test at your age and by the time you get called for the next step you would probably be at least 21. I never knew about this option so I took it this past June. My list number is in the low 200s but it will still be a while before I get called (If I’m lucky enough to get called ☺)  Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to be as thorough as possible. I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck.  ",☺

t5_2qh1i,z0mbiegrl,1363714263,"**Reposted, but appropriate**  When I was 15 years old, I started attending a rather prestigious christian school. Yeah, yeah, uniforms and the whole bit. I'd grown up very sheltered, thus I wasn't really used to any kind of male attention, which I got, having developed early, in great quantities. Usually, I was either embarrased, or convinced that the guy(s) were playing some kind of joke on me. I didn't believe that I was really at all attractive.   Then one day I found a note in my locker. It was a plain white index card, folded over and sealed with a little foil heart sticker. Inside, it simply said ""I think you're beautiful."" in careful print. That one got to me. It was very, very different from what I was used to... Basically leering, dirty comments, or propositions. That was sweet, innocent, and touching. I wondered who sent it, but didn't really have any way of finding out.    So I stuck it in one of my notebooks and began to daydream about who might be my secret admirer. Was it the cute boy who gave me a pencil in my homeroom? Maybe my lab partner, who I found utterly adorable, even though he was a few years older than I was.     I was a ditzy, moony eyed teenage girl, dreaming of puppy love and maybe my first kiss. I took the note out whenever I was sad or upset and it always made me smile, but weeks had passed and I had no idea at all who had left it, nor had I gotten another one. I began to worry that maybe it wasn't really meant for me at all. Maybe someone had just put it in the wrong locker by mistake.     I was feeling down on myself and a little silly when I opened my locker one morning and - behold! - another note. Same little white index card, folded over and sealed with the same little foil heart. Trembling with excitement and anticipation, I carefully peeled one lobe of the heart up and read the following words: ""You are so lovely."" Like any dopey kid, I held the note to my chest, sighing, with a dumb grin on my face. 2 notes? It was no accident! Someone really liked ME. WOW!    I made a dumb little scrap book thing and tucked the notes inside. I also began trying again in earnest to discern the identity of my secret admirer, but with only two unsigned notes as clues, I didn't get very far. I knew that whomever left the notes had to go to my school, that was obvious... But I didn't know much else. Maybe my admirer wasn't a guy at all. Damn. I didn't like mysteries I couldn't solve.     During this time, I had been building a friendship with a classmate, we'll call him Mark. Mark was a sophmore (I was a senior) but we had AP Latin together. We shared a free period as well, and sometimes hung out in the library, as we were both avid readers. Mark wasn't exactly my type, if a 15 year old can be said to have one, but he was sweet and we had many common interests.     As we spent more time together, I started thinking that the notes were from him. Then one day, he confessed to ""liking"" me, and I had my answer! Or so I thought.    Mark told me how he felt over stale fundraising donuts eaten on the back wall behind the gym. I laughed, getting powdered sugar all over my stupid vest. ""Why the big charade?"" I asked, ""Why didn't you just tell me to begin with instead of leaving me those mysterious notes?"" Mark's face fell. ""What notes? I didn't send you any notes, Z0mbiegrl."" The mystery continues... but now I had a coconspirator. (Forgive my naivette. I was 15 and didn't realize how cruel it was to use someone who had just confessed to liking me, but that I wasn't really all that keen on to help me figure out who my secret admirer was, all the while hoping it was someone I really DID like...)     Another week, another note. ""I think about you always."". Awwww. Mark was starting to exhibit some signs of jealousy, which I brushed off. After all, we didn't know who the mystery notesender was. It could be *snort* ""Riley!"" (The token loaner/weird kid).    Time went on, and I started losing focus in class. My grades didn't slip or anything, I made up for it, but as a normally attentive student, there was a clear shift in my attention. I went from listening intently to a talk on greek mythology to being called on and gasp! not knowing the anwser because I was too busy staring off into the distance and imagining my secret admirer as some sort of Tuxedo Mask-like figure, who would someday reveal himself and give me a rose and a dashing smile.     The next note said ""You smell like love itself."" Huh. I didn't know how to take that. I smelled like a combination of L'Oreal Kids Cherry shampoo and Cotton Candy Body Fantasies™. But, if that was what love smelled like, ok!     The next note said ""I want to touch you."" Ok. That's a little creepy, but maybe in a kind of sweet way, right? Mark was freaked out and said I should go to the authorities, or at least the Head Mistress. I was dead set against that. I might scare my admirer away, if not get him/her in trouble. I didn't want to do that. So I tucked the note away with the others and waited for the next one.     I spent the night at a friend's house at some point during this whole affair. Typical teenage stuff. We watched stupid movies, gossiped about everything, ate junk food, and played with makeup. It was a great time, though by then I had begun to realize that I fit in better with the boys (Especially the video game/tabletop playing kind) than I ever would with the girls.     When I left the following morning, something caught my eye - and stopped my heart. On my friend's mailbox, shimmering innocently in the 10:00 AM light, was a foil heart.     Ok, now I was officially freaked out. I ran back inside and told my friend and her mother. Both of them seemed to think I was on something or overreacting. It was, after all, February. Heart stickers were everywhere. That one might've even been there for a while and I just hadn't noticed it. I dropped it, but inside I was still afraid.     Monday morning... another note. ""I want to taste you."" OK, this wasn't cool anymore. Not at all. But I didn't know what to do. I talked about it to Mark, who convinced me to approach the school's very own Safety Officer... Who proceeded to laugh at me. ""Kid, if I went after every hormone addled guy with a crush who didn't have the balls to admit it, I'd be here forever!"" Yeah. Ok.      I stole one of my father's pocket knives and began carrying it around with me ""for protection"". (Yeah, like a dull 2"" blade is going to stop ANYONE.) I stopped going to my usual after school activities and hurred for my bus as soon as the bell rang. I always took the seat closest to the door in class, so I could see if anyone looked in, or looked suspicious as they passed by. And I found more heart stickers. It felt like they were everywhere I looked. I started having panic attacks when I saw them. On the window of my mother's car. On the table I sat at at lunch. On the door of the girls' room after I left (When it hadn't been there before).     Mark wanted me to go to the ""real cops"", but I couldn't make myself do it, not after the way Safety Guy had treated me. I didn't want to be laughed at again. It's a major issue for me, not to be taken seriously. So I did nothing. I suffered in silence. Until one day I came home and got the mail. Just like always... only this time, mixed in with the catalogs and bills was a plain white envelope sealed with one of those goddamned evil foil hearts.    Inside it were pictures. Horrible pictures. Pictures of a grown man in various states of undress, doing things to himself. And a note. ""I bet your blood tastes like chocolate.""     I started screaming, which got my mother's attention. She called the police, who came out to the house and took a report. Luckily, I recognized the man in the photos, and they were more than enough evidence to arrest the slimeball. He was the school janitor.   **TL;DR: It was the Janitor.**   **Yes, I was a senior at 15. I skipped a few grades.**  ",™

t5_2qhk3,handsomemod,1363744515,"&gt;they lack access to the institutional weapons  This is very interesting to me. Are you saying I have access to institutional weapons? Surely these are kept under the highest level of secrecy, as none of my fellow patriarchy brethren have been given clearance yet. Even at our world patriarchy conventions there is no talk of these weapons. Tell me, are they powerful? I've always wanted a laser cannon, but apparently the technology just hasn't caught up yet. I imagine that we men could easily create such advanced weaponry, and we're simply keeping it away from the prying eyes of women. If you could PM me the details of these weapon caches I would be most appreciative. Any tool to aid me in oppressing others will be most welcome. May the patriarchy protect you.  Edit: It seems [the actual definition of bigotry](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=define%3A+bigotry&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) doesn't fit with yours.

t5_2u3e2,ghoti2007,1363745680,"I fly with glitter a lot, Tristan and Valcent despite their rough exterior and Tristans unusual obsession with kesha, actually do a lot.  Glitter is more about plexing than fighting.  Since it's inception (i was there) glitter has always been about plexing (usually more about deplexing).  Glitter is extremely newbie friendly, which is why i took a liking to it right away.  I was flying with almity and pinky on the nightly e-uni and lna brawls in my 1week toon trying to not fuck up with everyone in their fancy cruisers laughing at me (not really, but it sucks not having any sp).  tristan said fuckit, here's a bunch of ultra cheap ships (similar to fwee) and we shall go learn how to operate as a team, and die together in the same stuff. glitter is always plexing or deplexing _something_.  taking way larger than needed fleets to help deplex or plex a system so some drunks or newbies can learn and not worry about fucking up.  no one is making money off of glitter, trust me.  ill agree that the silly sometimes takes over from the 'work' that is orbiting buttons, but cmon, you gotta do something to keep people wanting to plex.  tristan has a lot of skill and knowledge and is getting better as an fc (he has admittedly stated he uses glitter to become a better leader, drunk or not ha)  glitter has a lot of good fights, maybe not BNI Talwar or e-uni hazing or LNA finally undocked kinda fights, but they are there.  i rarely if ever return from a glitter experience with the first ship i left with.  if glitter is out, and pinky or almity or whoever sends a ping out for a big fleet, glitter disbands (usually), and forms up with them to be part of the team.  glitter isn't really recruiting for TEST or BL.  thats jokes.  we take local sperging to a weird level (changing the corp/alliance name link to say fun things about shamans and mages for raiding gets people mad i guess).  glitter is probably more about the silly than the actual fighting, and ill be the first to admit we do some silly things (and have terrible comm habits).  glitter also does this (mostly) self sufficiently.  tristan funds most (if not all?) of the hulls and mods for our shitfits.  we have occasionally bombarded fwee for stuff much to turing's despise, but tristan is really the wallet here.  as far as the warzone, we are getting pounded all around, and i dont think thats anyone's fault really.  a lot of people got burnt out from the fall of dal™ (seriously, it was a weeklong epic trail of fights) and after we pushed us into T3 with our massive (our being everyone donated) LP push, it was gone when fweddit returned from our 'oopsie' hiatus from FW.  didnt mean to write a novel, nor attacking you, but i think you have the wrong idea about glitter?",™

t5_2cneq,devilsassassin,1363759147,"Uh, not really:  &gt; Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.  So that's a whole bunch of ""it may do this or that"" but not fully enough to see if it causes impairment like alcohol. It says don't mix with alcohol, but that's not the same thing.  &gt;Panel’s Assessment of Driving Risks: Low doses of THC moderately impair cognitive and psychomotor tasks associated with driving, while severe driving impairment is observed with high doses, chronic use and in combination with low doses of alcohol The more difficult and unpredictable the task, the more likely marijuana will impair performance.  It also says that they approve the use of Marinol when driving, which is synthetic THC. So they don't really say its not ""safe"". They say that they think people who use it chronically or get higher are worse at driving (duh?) but it doesn't say its ""unsafe"" or give a level like .08 BAC for THC. It says that they don't really know, but they approve the synthetic version for driving. Which is somewhat contradictory.",®

t5_2w7lx,eXeApoth,1363776092,"Hello chaps, this is Apothne. If you're looking for a new armour doctine for your large fleets I'd highly reccomend considering the Augoror/Maller fleet concept that became very popular after Retribution. Another large-member corp that uses it as standard is Fwedddit, and they use it exceptionally well with their large numbers.  It is both a very forgiving doctrine (these things are tanked up the wazoo) but when you start getting towards T2 medium lasers also have excellent damage projection with scorch.  An excellent addition to this doctrine is the dual-prop Thorax, which double as excellent tackle and a lot more DPS, for a slightly smaller tank. This means you can AB fit the Mallers for l33t sig tanking and still have strong heavy tackling, beyond the legions of frigates. The duality of prop, and the decision between CNA and Void make this Thorax fit interesting to fly and teaches good piloting skills.  The most powerful kind of EWAR to use with this fleet (and arguably the most powerful EWAR  of the moment) are sensor damps, and Celestis can be fit both to sit in the middle of the blob and catch reps or the more traditional""stay at range and coward out"". There are multiple ways to use the two types of script which leads to interesting decisions that can be made by your FCs and pilots, leading to much more fun than lock the target, shoot the target, lock the next target, etc etc etc.  Apoth ♥",♥

They read the above quote and conclude that marijuana drivers are in fact better by using selective quoting.   &gt; Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance  Wow!

Well, I'm not fluent in metaphysics, but it sounds similar to *god of the gaps*. What is unknowable today, might pretty damn well be knowable in the future. Just because we haven't invented instruments to measure stuff doesn't mean they are above our reality.  So basically, the moment metaphysics becomes relevant is the same moment it isn't metaphysics any longer. Which implies.. uh. Stuff.  &gt;I used to think hypnosis was quackery  I don't know how this relates, I've seen hypnosis in action. A close relative of mine treated phantom pains (when an amputated limb still hurts) through hypnosis quite successfully, but it's really just a branch of psychology.  &gt; I, myself, am agnostic about the issue.  I'm open to the possibility that there might be things not known or unknowable  Agreed, I too am agnostic about stuff I don't know enough about. There are plenty of probably-unknowables, for example stuff behind the event horizon but I don't see a distinction between some real source and the physical world.   In the end, our minds are pretty simple really and aren't built to understand everything. Some things may never be understood by us because of our own limitations.

Not only has is repeatedly been proven wrong in important areas (neuroscience, quantum mechanics) but you also have to look at the basis for the claim, and the person claiming it.  Ironically, the only way to claim that complete truth is unknowable is to have knowledge that this person necessarily cannot have.  No matter how sure you are that True Reality™ is beyond our understanding, you cannot ever claim this in a reasoned argument.

Palin, while representing an attempt by the GOP to break out of its stodgy Old White Male image, was simultaneously someone who had that 'relatable country' image that plays so well to the Southern majority.  Her tendency to say whatever came to mind, no matter how ridiculous or historically inaccurate, made her an ideal rabble rouser when backed up by the Fox machine.

It makes sense from a business perspective for them to try and revitalize perceptions of the game and ""fluff up"" the next expansion by using these existing assets as feature points. ...but blah blah blah...

This would make for a heavier flywheel which would spin much faster and longer after the initial ""throw"", plus the whole thing will be running on smoother, sturdier bearings capable of supporting hundreds of pounds. You can put a camera mount on the rim, and if necessary counterweight it by attaching something opposite for balance.  If you need a broader circle, just clamp some sort of extension on (like the steel arm in the video) but just make sure to balance it with a weight on the other side.  **EDIT:** That was quick!

I hate this idea that you're the best - because you're not. I'm the best. I'm the best in the world™!   There's one thing you're better at than I am and that's kissing Pudie's ass. You're as good at kissing Pudie's as as keefy was! I don't know if you're as good as Travis though, he's a pretty good ass kisser. Always was and still is. Whoops! I'm breaking the fourth wall.   I am the best commenter in the world. I've been the best ever since day one when I found this subreddit and I've been vilified and hated since that day because grassyknoll saw something in me that nobody else wanted to admit. That's right I'm a grassyknoll guy. You know who else was a grassyknoll guy? Derpinn. And he split, just like I'm splittin' but the biggest difference between me and Derpinn is that I'm going to leave with the Wreddit Karma Championship.  I've grabbed so many of Pudie's imaginary brass rings that it's finally dawned on me that they're just that: they're completely imaginary. The only thing that's real is me and the fact that day in and day out for almost 1.5 years I have proved to everybody in the WORLD that I am the BEST - ON this community, IN THE discussion threads even on YouTube. Nobody can touch me!  And yet no matter how many times I prove it, I'm not on your lovely little sidebar images, I'm not a moderator, I'm barely upvoted, I don't get to be on the front page, I'm certainly not a part of any crappy ""this happened so I have to do this"" bets on Squared Circle, I'm not on the little avatar for wreddit, I'm not in the signature at the top of the subreddit! I'm not on Botchamania, I'm not on Art of Wrestling but the fact of the matter is I should be.  Trust me, this isn't sour grapes. But the fact that TRAVIS is a new moderator and I'm not makes me sick! Oh and hey let me get something straight: those of you upvoting me right now - YOU are just a big as part of me leaving as anything else. Because you're the ones that are promoting Botchamania right now. You're the ones that promote those sidebar images that my face isn't on. And then at 5 in the morning you try to shove it in my face so you can get my thoughts on it and try to make me look bad on Squared Circle because you're too immature to go get a hobby.  I'm leaving with the Wreddit Karma Championship on an undisclosed date and hell who knows? Maybe I'll go defend it in r/TNA. MAYBE I'll go back to r/WWE. Hey form_wrestle_account how ya doin'? The reason I'm leaving is you people because after I'm gone you're still gonna pour content in to this subreddit. I'm just a spoke on the wheel. The wheel's gonna keep turning and I understand that. But Pudie's going to own Wreddit despite himself. He's a comment slut who SHOULD BE a comment whore.  You know why he's not a comment whore? It's cause he surrounds himself with glad handing, non-nonsensical, douche bag yes-men like JaysonGrayson who's gonna tell him everything he wants to hear. And I'd like to think that maybe this community will be better after Pudie goes away but the fact is it's gonna get taken over by his idiot friends and his doofus partner-in-law and the rest of his stupid clique.  Let me tell you a personal story about Pudie, alright? We do this whole bully campaign... ",™

t5_2qwvg,flip69,1363835252,"&gt;i could have sworn i read that taking 5-htp within 3 days before rolling would increase the chances of getting S.Sydrome, or am i wrong?   3 days?  Yeah that doesn't make any sense.  The 5hpt would have metabolized out of the system rather quickly.   You need not need to take any 5hpt to get Serotonin syndrome.. people can mix different meds together and get that on their own for awhile now.   There's some info that some very large doses (400mg) have been given daily for [those with migraine headaches](http://www.indiadivine.org/showthread.php/984579-Metabolism-and-absorption-of-5-HTP).    It's important to remember that normally the body self regulates the biosynthesis of such neurotransmitters and other molecules, it's only when we administer a drug that these natural checks and balances tend to get disrupted.  That's why being well educated is important.  &gt;you're suggesting that i should take 50mg before AND after (friday and sunday) would be good? i normally take around 100-200mg 5-htp for a few days following a single nights roll  I seem to do just fine with 75mg midway through... I'm sure that afterwards will also be important but I would lower the dosage down to something like 50mg. I would be looking to try to restore a balance physically.  I don't want to sound all new age about this but it's important to listen to what your body needs and be self aware of things..  So I can't just blind call on this... just that it would seem to be of benefit and that the studies have shown it's effectiveness in treating depression.   It should also work in helping people with a post MDMA depletion.    That's not to say that the neural HT system isn't going to be stressed and damaged afterwards...  5htp should help in some aspects.    All of this is theory and there really needs to be a lot more research done. for example over a decade ago there was the popular advance of the idea that taking prozac™ 4 hours after the peak of the MDMA trip would [help protect people from much of the physical damage theoretically caused by the MDMA.](http://thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html).   However the moderate use of 5HTP *should be safe. if pure MDMA is used in moderate doses.*   however the realities are that many times people aren't just taking MDMA but something else of dubious quality and quantity... the only real defense against harm is to be well educated regarding the mechinisms &amp; associated risks combined with testing beforehand.   hope that this helps* :)",™

t5_2qh16,aim2free,1363858089,"&gt; Are you stupid?  I take that as a rethorical self reflective question.  &gt; Lobbying is completely legal.  ""legal"" doesn't imply *ethical*, *fair* or *trying to improve the human condition*. Lobbying when performed by the monetary wealthy corporativistic maffia is usually performed in these assholes' self interest only.  &gt; If you run a company with large profits  I think you are coming closer to the problem now❣  How do you define ""profit"" ?  These assholes often define ""profit"" as the amount of money they have been able to hoard by stealing, that is, by selling the same stuff over and over again❢  I define ""profit"" as how much beneficiary effect a specific action has had upon improving the human condition or the society's progress. Counting in ""money"" is completely awkward, limiting, and braindead. Monetary thinking is only useful when money is seen as a tool to store and move motivational energy, that is all what they are good for.  &gt; you set aside some of those profits to invest in creating or changing laws that will help grow your profits.  This awkward principle is usually denoted ""winner takes all"" and should definitely be illegal, at least as long as people are braindead and only think about their own asses.  &gt; You're a fool if you run a large corporation and don't try to lobby.  I'm the owner(part), CEO/chairman of two companies, small so far.  I'm working on making them grow. This growth should never be delivered to monetary hoarders, neither myself, this growth is intended to kill this insane system and making it fair. Lobbying I'm doing as well, as being a member of [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), [FFII](http://www.ffii.org/), [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/) and [The Pirate Party](http://www.piratpartiet.se/) as well as a sympathizer for [Anonymous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29) and [Occupy Wall Street](http://occupywallst.org/), but as a company, we will only provide services and not mix into politics at all. These services we provide will be based upon only paying for something once, instead of the current system which is based upon [Economies of the scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) but the wrong part of the curve.  The current ""industrial"" system tries to lower the cost of production, without feeding back this lowered cost of production into a gain for all by investing it into better technology, more research, more freedom. Insted this dystopic system is trying to lock people into adverse cost spirals, keeping them in a Status Quo grip, making them pay for the same thing over and over and spend some of the money on [patent trials instead of research/development](http://bgr.com/2012/06/08/apple-motorola-patent-case-judge-dismisses-with-prejudice/#utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBoyGeniusReport+%28BGR+|+Boy+Genius+Report%29)...

t5_2qhwp,SilentProtagonist,1363867956,"Oh what the fucking fuck!?!  I don't even mind the language (ignoring the insults for now) or the excitement/frustration but first of all: you don't shout in your rivals' faces, especially not insults. Totally not cool.   And secondly, the outbursts seemed more of an end in themselves instead of actual expression of involvement. They were happy to shout not because they won but because they now had an excuse to shout, mostly in the other guys' faces.   Thirdly: volume. Seriously.   But I guess the argument about e-sports being like any other sport is really one of the reasons I'm ever so slightly wary of competitive gaming. It's been a long tradition and back in the good old days™ there was a qualitative difference in the behavior of competing teams but with increasingly larger events and more money involved it does drag some sportsfan-culture into an area that's broader than traditional sports.  I know I'm gonna sound like a smugly conceited tosser but I'm just gonna say it: I don't care for sports and I certainly don't care for the fan-culture surrounding it. But that's fine because I can easily ignore both. Now when things like this happen with games, well, it's harder to dodge. There's always been annoying chucklefucks in gaming culture but when you have developers, publishers and sponsors effectively fostering and catering to the likes of these, ahem, gentlemen it does spill over into non-professional multiplayer games and even singleplayer games, in the form of people who identify way too much with specific esports-celebrities or franchises.   I don't want TF2 to turn into soccer with hats. I don't know if I have any right to determine what (multiplayer) games ""should"" be but I guess we can all agree that the last thing gaming needs is more shouting. ",™

t5_2ugo7,silentdragoon,1363870842,"FREMONT, California — March 21, 2013 — Corsair®, a worldwide designer of high-performance PC gaming peripherals, today announced the Vengeance K70 fully mechanical gaming keyboard.  The new Vengeance K70 gaming keyboard is built on a rugged, brushed, aluminum chassis and features highly responsive Cherry MX Red mechanical switches under every key. The high performance switches combined with the keyboard's 100% anti-ghosted matrix, 20-key rollover and 1000Hz reporting rate provide fast, accurate input for gaming.  The Vengeance K70 gaming keyboards are available in two color schemes:  silver aluminum with blue backlighting, and anodized black with deep red backlighting. Overall backlighting can be adjusted to four levels of intensity and each key is individually backlit, enabling the lighting for each key to be independently enabled or disabled. The key-by-key lighting customization allows users to highlight just the keys they need to emphasize and then save the setting directly to the K70's onboard memory. In addition, the Vengeance K70 comes with alternate colored, contoured keycaps for the  WASD and 1-6 keycaps to allow additional customization.  ""When we launched the Vengeance K60, customers loved the look and quality, but some wanted a backlit version,"" said Ruben Mookerjee, VP and General Manager of the Peripherals Business Unit at Corsair.  ""In typical Corsair fashion, we over-delivered and created Vengeance K70 with key-by-key backlighting, mechanical switches on every key, and two color schemes.""  The Vengeance K70 also features dedicated multimedia controls to allow users to play, stop, pause, skip tracks and adjust volume. An extra USB connector is provided for attaching to USB devices such as a Vengeance gaming mouse or headset. A removeable soft-touch wrist rest provides comfort for long gaming or typing sessions.  **See Vengeance K70 at PAX East from March 22-24**  The Vengeance K70 keyboard will make its public debut at Corsair's booth at PAX East in Boston from March 22-24. Corsair is located in booth 1062.  **Pricing and Availability**  The Corsair Vengeance K70 will be available in April at suggested price of $129.99.

t5_2qxih,dulfy,1363878290,"Hi everyone,  With the launch of the Relics of the Gree event behind us, I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about the general state of the game and the launch of our Free-to-Play option.  Judging by the conversation in the forums and elsewhere, there appears to be a level of curiosity among many players to learn how things are going at the studio since the launch of the Free-to-Play option. Of course, that’s natural. We’re now about 120 days post-launch and more than 5 months into our new series of content updates, so we’re just starting to get a feel for it ourselves. In our commitment to improve the overall player experience, it’s important to reflect on all of the changes that we have made since last year.  Last spring, there was some uncertainty surrounding Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ as we were starting to lose subscribers and players were growing frustrated. In fairness, many of the complaints and worries were justified. In an effort to try to address everything, we just weren’t sufficiently focused on improving the core experience.  At the end of the summer, we announced that were going to make the game more enjoyable than ever before by working to improve three key aspects of the game: making it easier to find friends to play with (via Group Finder), increasing the cadence of our content updates (so players wouldn’t have to wait around for new stuff), and bringing back vitality to the game by reaching out to new players via a Free-to-Play option. In addition we introduced some cool new items for everyone to check out via the Cartel Market.  So how did it go? Well, you can see for yourself when you log in to the game. Our new, high capacity servers are teeming with people. Since launch of the Free-to-Play option we have had over 2 million new accounts created and have thousands of new players jumping in every single day. This means more people to play with, more growth for your guilds, more Warzone matches, and more ways for players to continue to advance their characters.  Even though there’s bound to be dissent about every aspect of MMOs on the internet these days, player feedback, in general, has been very positive about the new things in the game. We’re committed to continuing our 8-week new content cadence, and are looking forward to the launch of the first Digital Expansion: Rise of the Hutt Cartel this spring.  **And I’m happy to announce that we’ll be introducing several new features along the way, like a new customization feature, which will allow you to change your character's hair style, eye color, body type, or even species (including the upcoming Cathar!) using Cartel Coins. Look for it in early summer.**  We know that there are still a lot of things we need to do to make playing Star Wars: The Old Republic the best experience it can be. We hear you on features such as hood toggle (as one example of many), Asia Pacific server populations (we are actively looking into solutions that make the most sense given our current tech and should have an announcement soon), continued improvement to the Cartel Market pricing and content, and the need to keep working on performance improvements and bugs. In fact, our major focus after Rise of the Hutt Cartel launches is going to be on ""quality of life"" improvements. We will keep at it, I promise. We’ll keep listening to your feedback and continue to dedicate ourselves to making the game the best it can be. Nothing is more important to us than getting it right.  Thanks for your continued support and see you on Makeb!",™

t5_2ryr3,lxKillFacexl,1363893060,"Ok, so you can fix this. You just have to get a refund for the first purchase and buy it again at the sale price now. You will get the refund in 7 days. Here's my chat log.  Tip: Be very nice to the CSR and they will want to help you.  _______________________________  You are now ready to chat with Rajeev.   Rajeev   Thanks for contacting EA Help! My name is Rajeev how may I help you?   you   Hi Rajeev   Rajeev   Hello Matt   Rajeev   How you doing today?   you   I'm good. just have something I'd like you to help me with   you   I purchased Battlefield 3 as my free game from SimCity. Then, I immediately purchased the Premium pack from the ""Info"" button on the game listed in my ""My Games"". I paid the full $44.99 for it, however, I noticed now, from a post by another player on Reddit, that the ""Player appreciation sale"" was already on at the time and it should have sold for $24.99.   you   ORDER NUMBER: XXXXXXXXX   you   Why was the price different in this location? I would appreciate getting the difference back. Origin credit would be fine as I want to grab the Shortcut Kits.   Rajeev   I'll have to check. Can I also have your email ID?   you   certainly, XXXX@XXXX.com   Rajeev   Thanks. Is it okay for you to hold the chat for 1-2 minutes?   you   Yes, take your time.   Rajeev   The order number that you have provided is of SimCity Digital Deluxe Edition. Can I have the order number of your premium purchase?   you   No, that's the one for Battlefield. The content of the confirmation email: PURCHASE CONFIRMATION PAYMENT METHOD: Mastercard ORDER NUMBER: XXXXXXXXX DATE: 19 Mar 2013 14:24 GMT ITEM PURCHASED:	PRICE: Own More With Battlefield 3 Premium	 $ 51.97 TAX: $ 5.98 TOTAL: $ 51.97 © 2013 Electronic Arts Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Rajeev   Let me cross check.   you   I just checked my Order History and this is the number for SimCity:XXXXXXXXX   Rajeev   I apologize this is of BATTLEFIELD 3 PREMIUM SERVICE.   you   yes, exactly   you   So that's what I'm saying. I purchased that on Tuesday morning.....when the sale was already on (but I didn't know it was on) and it didn't have the sale price where I purchased it   Rajeev   My bad! I located different ID :(   you   no problem   Rajeev   Please provide me the answer of security question listed in your account. The question is: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX?   you   XXXXXXXXXX   Rajeev   Thanks. It's matching.   Rajeev   Now coming to the resolution part, is that sale still going on?   you   yes.   you   I can see it on Origin store now. It lists it as $24.99   Rajeev   Okay. Since issuing partial refund for this order isn't possible, I'd suggest to purchase the game once again on discounted price.   you   So you will refund it and I will purchase it again?   Rajeev   And continue to play the game. We'll be processing the refund for order number ""XXXXXXXXX"" after 7 days. As the invoice becomes available for refund only after 7 days.   you   Oh. So, just buy it now at the discounted price, and then the refund will process in 7 days for the original purchase?   Rajeev   Yes, we'll refund the entire 51.97   you   and at that point, it's not going to disable the new purchase or anything?   you   (just worried about having a DLC twice, if that'll work ok)   Rajeev   Don't worry, this will not create any issue.   Rajeev   I apologize for not able to do this instantly. Matt, just contact us again after 7 working days and refer this case ID XXXXXXXXXX   you   oh, no, that's no problem   you   Great, thank you very much.   Rajeev   Our next advisor will process the refund if the invoice will be available for refund. I'm going to mention every detail in the above case.   Rajeev   Thanks for your co-operation Matt.   Rajeev   Please contact us after 28th and we'll process your refund.   you   Excellent. Thank you very much for your help. You were very responsive and understanding. Much better than the person I talked to a few hours ago. I had to leave the chat early on them for work, but they weren't very helpful and really slow and only offered me a 15% discount. If your monitors are reading this, you did a very good job.   Rajeev   Thanks so much for your appreciation and feedback.   Rajeev   I do apologize on behalf of our previous advisor.   you   Cheers, have a good day.   Rajeev   Let me know if I can be of any other help?   you   No worries, I know they can't all be top quality. I used to work in a call center myself back in college   Rajeev   You too have an excellent day ahead!   you   Nope, that's it. Thanks.   Rajeev   If you need help with anything else, please feel free to contact us anytime!   Rajeev   Bye and Take Care Matt!   you   Bye, you too.  ",©

It's part of the de Boer / Ajax philosophy to play this way even if it plays into the opponent's hand (it might still be beneficial for Ajax in the long term, since they want to reach a higher level and play this sort of football at that level, so this could be considered painful practice).",™

We're aiming for maintaining a mid-length coat so it's not dragging in the dirt and water and such. The flocks actually help their temperature regulation quite a bit (especially when running - they act almost like the blades of a fan), so shaving them down is not a very good idea. And considering the composition of their coat (it has two types of fur, twined in an additional layer of ""goat"" hair), keeping it brushed only really works as puppies.  The flocks are very beautiful, and they cause the dog zero discomfort. Komodors are large corded dogs, Bergamascos are the medium flocked dogs, and Pulis are the small corded dogs. You can cord poodles as well, I believe, but the fur doesn't do that naturally - it would take special grooming to achieve that effect.",♥

With fruits, fruits contain a good amount of sugar. Too much sugar makes you fat. So for you, in my opinion at least, I'd say cut back some on fruits, and eat more veggies (green and all kinds of colors), beans, nuts/seeds and grains. Also consider incorporating healthy fats in your diet-like say cooking with, or adding to your smoothies or other recipes, hemp seed oil and/or extra virgin coconut oil. Strangely enough, fats don't make you fat. Some fats (like hemp seed oil and coconut oil) help you lose weight. Hope that's helpful! 😃",😃

t5_2rfus,tobascodagama,1363900237,"Q23: Hurant - Can healers expect items with proc on heal in the near future? Especially the golden Rohan final ring upgrades or mooncandle necklaces?  A23: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano There are two new healer rings being released with Update 10.1 – one that is might-based and another that is will-based, both with on-heal procs ------  Q24: GingerAJ - With us now receiving items, that have effects when causing or receiving damage, will we receive items that activate on other effects?  A24: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano Simply put…yes. Although there is no set timeline, you should start to see a larger variety of proc effects being released with future updates. -------  Q25: Elemiire - Will you fix the 'procs' on the Upgraded Rohan Rings to benefit healers and support classes?  A: 25: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano As mentioned above, there are two new healer rings being released with 10.1 ---------------  Q26: Nasami - Cosmetic gear slots? My LM has found some gorgeous staves, only to lose how they look because she found better quality gear. Please?  A26: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano Unfortunately due to tech limitations, this is not really an option ---------------------  Q27: Nasami - Verizal: Is there a way to make war-steed riding 'smoother'? The regular mounts' gait looks so much more natural than the war-steed's gallop...  A27: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano This is another tech limitation that we are forced to deal with. Given their inclusion in combat, the war-steeds have a heavier set of restrictions that they must abide by in order to keep combat, itself, as flowing and functional as possible. -------  Q28: OverlordGate - Which instance cluster will be scaled and revamped next and when can we expect it?  A28: Derek Flippo Right now we’re focusing on prototyping Helm’s Deep instanced content for the upcoming expansion pack. After we’ve shipped the expansion we’ll evaluate the remaining potential revamps vs. making new instances. -----------  Q29: Nyrion – Any plans to change the virtue system? Slayer deeds in particular?  A29: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti We’re considering changes to slayer deeds to get them to fit in with future class changed.They may no longer be directly tied to specific skills, but rather, give you progression you can choose. -----  Q30: JeauxLOTR - Who is the RK Developer and when will they begin to engage the RK Community?  A30: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti While there are principle designers for each class, I do want to stress that this is a team effort. That said, Jinjaah is the principle on RK. ----  Q31: Tulcavaryar - Any plans to help hunters and burglars get their mitigations above 40% more easily?  A:31 Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti That will be dependent on what build you choose =) ------  Q32: MrWarg - Can we have more details about the class revamp please, specifically the implementation of skill trees?  A32: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti Three trees per class. Some degree of blending at a higher cost than sticking with a pure build. Bonuses granted based on an early-level specialization choice that grows as points are spent. You can have multiple specs. You can respec. -----------  Q33: Zalladi - When will the next 'Player-designed relic' poll be started?  A33: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti That’s up to Sapience.

Future changes should increase the challenge level. Because you won't be able to do everything as any class. -------------------  Q40: @ArtsySuvi Scarycrow, Bree looks awesome! You said you'd try to revamp the Prancing Pony interior; will we be seeing that soon?  A40: Matt “Scarycrow” Fahey Yes I do plan to revamp the interior for the Prancing Pony. This is a personal project of mine. So when I have time, I'll get on it. -----------------  Q41: @Mithrandir99 any plans to give us cappies mounted helpers? #LOTRO  A41: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano Although captains aren't getting mounted helpers, all classes will be seeing new mounted traits and skills with U11. ----------------  Q42: @PArriola Will we be able to have crafting in houses?  A42: Matt “Scarycrow” Fahey Yes we will be adding crafting facilities to housing. -----------------------------  Q43: @Zyaxis the DMG and heal from conjunctions has not kept pace with our skills. Any changes coming ?  A43: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti We're looking at both the balance and timing of conjunctions. A43a: An update should come with the class changes. --------------------------  Q44: @jordan_rose72 is content meant to be this easy or is it a bug?  A44: Lauren “Budgeford” Salk Content is not 'this easy' for everyone. The goal of most landscape content is to let everyone play and enjoy it. Instanced content is intended to be more difficult. ------  Q45: @angelohouston Is it fair to say that you guys are now firmly committed to this ""tree"" revamp? #Lotro #Devchat  A45: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti Yes. ------  Q46: @pieeatingchamp will you be making tweaks to fate/power use because since U10 my warden barely uses any power fighting 10+ mobs #LOTRO #DEVCHAT  A46: Evan ""Verizal"" Graziano 10.1 will bring adjustments to fate and power to bring the stat down to a more managable level. Fate's contribution will be reduced. Skill costs will also be reduced. All classes underwent a round of balance. -------------  Q47: @MMOHippieChick RE: A 39. This sounds suspiciously like forced grouping. Me no likey.  A47: Matt ""Hoarsedev"" Zimmitti Each class on its own should be good enough at what you choose to do. You will have to approach challenges based on your build's strengths. This is specifically NOT intended to force grouping. ",™

When I was in Japan visiting my ex's family, they thought I was very strange and paranoid for practicing martial arts for self defense.  ....maybe it was because they knew I did mostly aikido and not a Real™ martial art.  EDIT: Kinda funny because my point (which I didn't make, go me) is that cultural bias plays quite a role in this.  For example, the folks who say those who carry a pistol are overly paranoid, and I received the same treatment from a people now known for their pacifism (even though we love our Japanese martial arts, the Japanese themselves haven't been too keen on actual martial arts since the War) for the practice of a simple, unarmed martial art whose entire thrust these days is to be non-violent and have compassion for your potential murderer.",™

This includes a large portion of ""casual"" gamers.  Try explaining to Grandma that running over pedestrians in GTA isn't as sociopathic as it looks.  Was Bethesda stifling your creativity by making children invulnerable in Skyrim?  What if there was a game called ""Sim-Steubenville?""  You might find it thought provoking, but others might find it in bad taste.  If the developer of *Sweatshop HD* went to Malaysia and showed his game, he could articulate his vision and be well received.  Now, if a Malaysian simply saw an average teenage dipshit getting his lulz by abusing his factory workers to get a high score, the intended nuance may not be obvious.  We may ""get"" these things, but Apple has to make a decision about what battles they are willing to fight and what they are willing to associate their brand with.  You or I may not always agree with where they draw the line, but your examples (TWD, Bastion) have proven that they are not anti-games or anti-gamer.

When you pay with your PayPal Debit MasterCard, you pay with your PayPal balance. If your purchase is more than your available balance, you can select a backup funding source for your debit card to cover the purchase.""*  Another feature that attracted me to debit MC was this:  *""There is no fee to use your PayPal Debit Card to make purchases from merchants that accept MasterCard. There may be fees associated with cash withdrawals at ATMs and foreign transactions.""*  Unlike the prepaid Visa debit cards, apparently Paypal doesn't charge a percentage of the amount of cash you load it with. I remember, back in the day, when Paypal offered a temporary MC number online if a credit purchase wanted to be made. It only took 2 seconds to request one and no fees were involved with it as well.  What I am about to find out is just how tolerant Paypal is with e-cig related purchases. I used my Paypal account to buy some stuff from another Redditor on /r/ecigclassifieds, but he never sent the stuff out. I went ahead and opened a claim on it this morning, but I don't have to be specific about the goods I purchased...yet.

The editing of Untucked this season is especially heavy handed, inserting obviously out of context looks and exclamations and having a Very Special Moment© in the Gold Bar as a middle act between a first and third of bitchery.

It's sort of a tautological thing that NO one who disavows (or even minimizes) the CAGW CO2 theory is allowed to claim the title of ""climate scientist"".  OTOH, it doesn't seem to matter WTF you have a degree in, so long as you work for one of the CAGW promoting orgs, THEN you can claim to be a ""climate scientist"".  ---  \* The whole ""Climate Scientist"" and ""Climate Science"" is just a WEIRDLY inane propagandistic way of phrasing (a way of creating a ""special group"" of people -- regardless of their actual degrees or credentials -- and tossing the mantle of ""science"" around them).  After all, other fields do not use such monikers, we do not have ""Physics Scientists"" nor ""Chemical Scientists"", etc -- people are *Physicists* and *Chemists* who work in *Physics* (not ""Physics Science"") or in *Chemistry*, with subfields noted *Organic Chemistry*, and so on (not ""Chemical Science"").    About the only other fields that have been doing this are the equally ""squirrelly"" quasi-socialistic/activist things like ""Education Science"" and because of political controversies, ""Medical Science"" (or also of course in the pseudo-science things like ""Creation Science"", etc) -- basically ONLY where there is a propaganda-based intent to PUSH the purported authority of ""science"" as a claim to respectability and to then use this moniker as a rhetorical club to denigrate the opposition with.  And of course with Climate, there already ARE terms for the primary field(s) and disciplines: *Climatology* and *Meteorology* (as well as *Climatologist* and *Meteorologist*).  But those CANNOT be used by the CAGW proponents, because the vast majority of the so called ""Climate Scientists"" do not in fact HAVE degrees in the actual ""Climate"" science fields -- they are largely NOT ""Climatologists"" or ""Meteorologists"" (or at least not so in terms of actual degree credentials, they often have a *title* of ""Climatologist"" or are head of *Departments* of ""Climatology"" despite not having the associated degree), so some new term NEEDED to be made up.  Plus, the inevitable ""double standard"" that then comes up: Person X who disagrees with or criticizes even just some part of the CAGW theory, but who does not have some ""position"" or ""title"" with an organization or entity that is considered ""Climate Science"", and regardless of their other many credentials (hilariously of course, even people WITH degrees in Meteorology and/or Climatology and other GeoScience disciplines, or even the SAME disciplines as quasi-officially recognized ""Climate Scientists"") these are roundly dismissed *and denigrated for NOT being a ""Climate Scientist""* with there particular degree used as a means of denigration (Oh, he's *just* a Geologist, or *just* a Physicist, etc);  yet the SAME standard is considered *wholly irrelevant* when it comes to the quasi-officially CAGW proponents -- just about ANY degree in ANY discipline (or indeed no degree at all, at least none on record) is considered sufficient in that case.  *It's all really rather revealing (not to mention hilarious).*",™

t5_2qh1i,DaMangaka,1363981168,"This is a trick question. Something I'm actually addressing in a book I'm writing. ~~YOU LIE MANGAKA! IT'S A HETALIA FANFICION!~~      I once went to the south and it seems many are in *love* with the ~~American~~ Statian culture. Why wouldn't they? All they get to see on TV (brought to you by TELEVISA©) is successful Americans who get to live on their daily lives. Watch any sit-com of what ever genre you want: comedy, action, drama... Despite the plot or the whole aspect of the show (heck, even the Walking Death, a post-apocalyptic show), I cannot deny that it is *much* better than what many folks in the South live on. People who can't even get regular running water or electricity, let alone dress so fashionably or be able to travel to places. This same formula is used by Soap Operas in Mexico to portray how a poor young lass (usually from the furthest of hills of the poor areas in Mexico), arrives to Mexico City, falls in love, drama and then finally she gets the guy whom she marries and moves to *Miami*, obtaining a better life.      However! As one that lives in the border - and the closer to the North you are, you get to realize this too - you get to notice that not much of the things you see in the US shows are *true* at all. You can distinguish between fiction and reality. Sure, some want to be trendy and what not, but certainly are the most vocal when it comes to pointing out the US' faults and bashing their culture.       In TL;DR: depends on your live, what you watch and learn really. Though, there are a *lot* of socialist movements in the south that *despise* everything that's from the States. Many in the North that make their babies be BORN in cities in the US so they have double nationality. So, more than rejecting or embracing, we move it as we please.      And IMHO, no. I don't want the US' culture to leak into Mexico that much. It would be very harmful TBH.   **EDIT TO EXPAND MORE:** We tend to be VERY embracing of many cultures. Our food is a prime example of what happens when we get immigrants. They become part of us and thus in the end, these immigrants become Mexicans too. : P   The problem with the US culture in general (there are good quirks like the whole ""STAND UP FER YER RIGHTS"" thing) is that it's *very* individualistic. Each man to it's own. Mexico is a communal culture (for the best or the worse) and it would be a horrible clash. I see it when I go to the States that there are all ""Americans"" but they have their own clikes, their own 'areas' where Latinos, Asians, African-American and others can be on their own instead of integrating and becoming one big happy (or angry?) country. When there is somebody succeeding, it's due that SPECIFIC clike (the ""*Chinese*-American director blah blah blah""). In Mexico, a German-Mexican is Mexican, period. You are no more special than anybody else (and therefore you are fucked by the system as everyone else. And if not, fuck you with the PRI). If a Japanese-Mexican talks, sure... at first many might be surprised that Japanese descendant people exist,but after learning he was born here, he'll just be one of the bunch. No special treatment, no nada. I don't say that it isn't good to rejoice of the multiple cultures and all but again, the US culture is very individualistic and the Mexican tends to suck everything in. All it might cause is to start separating us more . . .than what we are already. . .         ",©

t5_2qolb,tolos,1363990732,"I believe [bioplastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioplastic) is a type of biodegradable plastic, which probably isn't ideal for piercings. There are several different types of plastic jewelry which are safe to use:   &gt; Biocompatible polymers (plastics) including Tygon® Medical Surgical Tubing S-50HL or S-54HL, or PTFE (Teflon®), are considered suitable for new piercings. Tygon is a bio-compatible medical tubing that is highly flexible. It should be changed every few months as it stiffens and discolors from extended wear. PTFE, a white plastic, is widely accepted within the industry. Some polymers are marketed specifically for piercings in an array of colors and shapes. These may be worn as a substitute for metal jewelry. With new polymer products coming into the marketplace, check that the product you are purchasing, if not listed above, is USP VI compliant. These can be sterilized in an autoclave.    http://www.safepiercing.org/piercing/jewelry-for-initial-piercings/",®

Of course, this means the energy tablets are universal batteries. This seems to me like a big deal for modpack cohesion to me, and it means you could live without thermal expansion. Just using Buildcraft would be fine for fluid movement and railcraft has tanks that work with more fluids. If I can get permission, I'd love to have Xycraft as I already consider its tanks and sulfur torches indispensable.  For automining, another mod that fits in really well is Steve's Carts. SC2 miners are very underestimated with Railcraft is there making the yield on iron-&gt;rails so obscenely high. Also, Factorization and PowerConverters (limited to UE&lt;-&gt;Factorization only) are high on my list. Minefactory Reloaded might not be a bad call either.

t5_2rbzz,jarvis400,1364039591,"**Blend Name:**   Mac Baren HH Mature Virginia  **Description on Tin:**  &gt;Once you light up with HH Mature Virginia the sweet Virginia tobaccos will greet you and slowly the dark fired Virginia will enter the taste. Over time, experience how the complex, naturally sweet and slightly smoky taste grows in power making HH Mature Virginia a satisfying blend to smoke - and with no tongue bite.  Another blurb from MacBee's website:  &gt;22 different tobaccos are included in this blend and of these 15 are Virginia tobaccos. Before blending the tobacco the Virginias has been stored for years to mature and develop the final aromas, just like when good wine is put aside for aging. Virginia types like bright yellow/golden leaf, mature red/mahogany leaf, dark Virginia and a Black Virginia Cavendish are blended and left to store so that each tobacco taste marry into a taste unity. To enhance and support the Virginias a touch of Oriental is added and finally the taste is rounded with just an easy hand of pressed Burley.  **Leaf:**  MV comes in a 100gr tin or a 16oz bag. I've only smoked tinned MV. The tobacco is short ribbon cut. From medium browns to darker shades. Quite dark for a virginia blend. The bright yellow and golden leaf mentioned in the description must have darkened with time or due to some other process. As per typical for MacB the tobacco cut is uniform and delightfully stem free. In the tin it arrives tight packed and fairly moist - far too moist for me to smoke straight out out of the tin.  **Tin Aroma:**   Now this one is really different! When opened it has quite distinct sour &amp; salty tang, not completely unlike some McClellands VA's. My first impression was brined Calamata olives. Some smell Tabasco. A friend claimed balsamico vinegar. Turns out he's actually right! Per Jensen at Mac Baren has confirmed that HH Mature Virginia actually has red wine balsamico added as a top note.  **Taste:**  Fire in the hole! The first sips has that sour tang as advertised in the tin aroma. If smoked in a blind test I'd probably mistake it as perique. There's a bit of lemon, some toast. Soon there's clearly some smokiness form the fired cured leaf. This gives a fine counter point to sweeter VAs.   Somewhere in the middle I'm getting spicy, herbal aromas, which I'm guessing are from tha oriental leaf in the blend. It's a slightly savory taste - a hint of Maggi spice, perhaps. The smokiness grows a bit troughout the bowl. I wouldn't be surprised if the burleys listed in the description were of the fire-cured variety. In the very end I'm getting some unwanted ashy taste, no doubt from the fire cured tobaccos.    **Smokability:**   The tobacco dries fairly quickly, which for me has the positive message that there are very little PG, or other humectants added. This is always *A Good Thing™*. The ribbon cut is easy to pack and it burns well. Like any VA heavy blend it can nip your tonque if smoked too fast or moist. Or both. The needle of my nicotine-a-meter travels slightly over the mid point.  **Room Note:**   Not quite sure about this, fairly OK, I'd imagine. It's not an aromatic, so the entertainment value is a moot point anyway. Might even be fairly well tolerated by SOs.   **Thoughts:**   This has become a one of my regular smokes along with FVF, which is altogether different but still more robust than most VAs. For me FVF is much sweeter than MV. Along some dry time, I think that MV benefits from some airing, not just drying, mind. I find that the last bowls of MV in the tin are the most tasty, for some reason. Always dependable, but still very variable tobacco. Like some other HH blends, MV is a distinct tobacco    **Recommend to:**  To everyone interested in well blended, natural tobaccos. Might even be a good starting point for aromatic smokers interested in the Good Stuff.  While I think the price shouldn't ever be an issue in tobacco reviews, I must say that the $12 US price for a 100gr tin is bargain price for a tinned tobacco of this quality.  **Summary:**   To me MV is quite savory Virginia tobacco, it has a lot of levels going on. If I'm in a bad mood or smoke this more quickly that usual, the taste can  be muted and convoluted.  It has a good body that many VA blends lack. Then again, the blend has many different types of tobacco, not just VA.  **My Background:**   Smoked pipes for twelve years enthusiasticlly. I smoke almost exclusively natural tobaccos; Virginias, VaPers, orientals, latakia blends (not keen on lat bombs). I've smoked this blends in briars and meers. Also, I wear a tutu when writing tobacco reviews.",™

Diffundox™ XL belongs to a group of medicines known as alpha blockers. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This condition is caused by the prostate gland growing too big and obstructing the flow of urine from the bladder. The usual symptoms are weak or interrupted urine flow, a need to pass water more frequently and/or a sudden need to pass water. BPH is not cancerous, and occurs mainly in older men and is fairly common.  Your capsules work by relaxing the muscle of the prostate gland and bladder exit, widening the urethra (the tube through which urine passes from the bladder to the outside of the body) and so relieving the symptoms of BPH.

From what he described, he's ingesting at least 50g of carbs a day and probably a good deal more (what he says isn't consistent; he says he's thinking about cutting out all fruit except strawberries in the comments but only mentions apples in his post).  One apple is about 20g of carbs, one slice of bread can range from 10 to 30 (or so), and 500g of ""vegetables"" (very broad term) would mean in the neighborhood of another 20g of carbs at a minimum (I used broccoli as my estimator, with 4g of non-fiber carbs per 100g).  50g might be ketosis for some people, but wouldn't be for many.  Add in more than one apple, some sugary Jell-O, or any other fruits, and he almost certainly wasn't in ketosis.  &gt;There's a difference between a ketogenic diet and Reddit Brand Keto®  There isn't even a reddit brand keto, and I do know what ketosis is.",®
t5_2qkeh,Not_Steve,1364071569,"You say you have ""(another) cold"", do you get them often? *I'm not a doctor*, but I suggest taking 1000 mg of Vitamin C a day and tell the people around you to take 500 mg. My favorite (and cheapest) way to do this is by taking Emergen-C, a drink supplement. [Here's their site](http://www.emergenc.com/index.php?mbl_bpass=yes) where you can request a free sample. I like to buy it at Costco [90 packets for $19.99](http://www.costco.com/Emergen-C®%2C-90-Packets.product.11614310.html?MobileOptOut=1). Drink with warm water (or juice) to kill a cough or soothe a sore throat.   All of this came suggested to me by my neurologist who became frustrated that I had to put off a lumbar puncture due to a stubborn cold. He says this is what he, his family, and his nurses take and they feel the effects right away. I can attest to it and my family (because there are so many in one household, the cold bug just circulates) have adopted the practice as well.   Sorry if the links revert to mobile sites, I tried it kill it, but I'm not sure if they stay/transfer over to computer. Also, sorry for the non-solicited medical advice from a non-doctor, I get colds a lot and know how agonizing they can be (especially with a schedule). I hope you feel better!",®

The PSU your friend has doesn't have a PCIe connector for a graphics card but the particular 7770 in this list comes with an adapter; a lot of the others do too.  The estimated peak wattage from PCPartpicker is 309W so the older PSU should still have a safe margin.  The motherboard isn't geared toward overclocking but i'm sure it'll overclock a bit still.  A $100 mobo would get you 8+2 phase power for better overclocking.  The motherboard supports the FX-83xx for upgrades and should support future processors as well.  There's still two ram slots left for you to upgrade that whenever; 4gb is enough for gaming though.",®

t5_2qh6c,missssghost,1364078773,"Speaking from an atheist p.o.v., sometimes it's best to keep your non-belief on the down-low.   You know your dad/parents best. If you think that divulging that you are having trouble with your faith or that you are an atheist  will cause problems for you (like being kicked out of the house, not being supported through college etc) it would be better for you to not broach the subject.   Keep being respectful, ask questions, read books, keep searching.   If the topic comes up and you feel that you will be okay if you tell your dad that you're an atheist, you might also want to be sure that you explain that you still have a lot of the same beliefs that your parents taught you: respect for others, love of family, friendship, being charitable, helping others etc.   Don't just focus on how your belief is different (not believing in god anymore) but also point out those positive things.

t5_2s0sd,fake_rolex,1364118742,"Hey! This is my first go at this sort of thing, but I definitely need to get it together and make some changes.   Vitals   * Weight: 243.5 * 5’10” * 24/M * Diet: Pescatarian  (no calorie counting, but generally staying below 3k)   Haven’t been regularly working out for a few months now (I know ☹ ), so strength and endurance will be quite low.  I have experience with the major lifts (worked myself into pretty decent strength via the Starting Strength program a few years ago), and want to incorporate running into my exercises.  My traditional problem adhering to an exercise plan is sticking to it/getting disappointed with the results, as in, working out for a few months, then seeing (in my eyes) little to no progress, then becoming discouraged and not working out.  Hopefully, setting short term goals will help me realize my progress and not be disappointed with the results or where I am at physically. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and that’s something I need to remember.   Sprint 1 Goals   * Lose 10 lbs * Acquire gym membership/work out at said gym 3x a week * Do C25K 2 days a week (I know this is gonna take forever to complete at this rate, but for this first cycle while I get my legs back under me it probably will be necessary) * Eat more fruits/veggies/yogurt * No fast food on weekdays/No French fries period  * Read 30 minutes a day  Long Term Goals   * &lt;200lbs  * Run a mile in &lt;8:00  * Be happy * Full vegetarian    Hopefully being active in this community will also keep me focused and on track.

t5_2qh13,Mondoshawan,1364159199,"&gt;  Your ""anger"" will subside as soon as the new call of duty game comes out.   What on earth makes you think someone like me would enjoy that fanchise? It's pure ""oh, bad terrorists, derp derp derp! Join the Fight For Freedom™!"".   &gt; If it doesn't mean this, then you can't write for shit and need to go back to school for basic writing classes.   Oh dear oh dear. Here is the sentence again:   &gt; &gt; Half of the Northern Alliance (the Uzbeks)   As in ""The Uzbek half"". You really need to twist things to interpret things they way you did. This is not a ""basic writing"" failure, the error is **entirely yours**. The bracketed part of the statement is an clarification on which half I was talking about. Had I wanted to say that all of the NA were Uzbek the correct thing to say would be ""Half of the Uzbek Northern Alliance"".   Besides, Dostrum wasn't just the ""leader"" of the Uzbeks, many other ethnic groups threw their hand in with his crew and as the leader of the most powerful group he had significant seniority. The present allegiances are strategic, not idealogical. They didn't believe in communism any more than they believe in western culture, their ally is nothing but a means to help them expand their territory. If anything Dostrum's people are *worse* than the Taliban.     &gt; just like the native americans had all of the landmass when the americans slaughtered them?  The America's were depopulated by around 80%-90% by disease before settlement really got started, so in many ways you could argue this.   However, instead of suprious comparisons, why don't you try to prove me wrong with some population numbers? ",™

t5_mouw,Tuckmo,1364171865,"Okay, it turned out to be a bit more than I had planned but here it is if you're interested.   It was two blotters of LSD. Unfortunately when I asked about the concentration they did not know. When we took them it was just my friend, T, and I in our apartment.  We went into it not in a recreational way but we wanted to use it as a learning tool. Up to that point I was a frequent pot smoker but had never had any experience with hallucinogens. All I knew was it could make you see things and that Steve Jobs attributed much of his success to the drug. What I didn't realize was that I would experience the most powerful and profound thoughts and feelings that I've ever had.   Now I was raised Christian but after someone very close to me died I, as many others, suddenly questioned this god I had heard was so powerful. If he was so powerful then why couldn't he save her when I prayed so hard and believed so deeply? With faith I can move mountains but I can't save someone from cancer? Well it was around this time I had randomly found Reddit not as a website but via the Reddit app iReddit. (Alien Blue user now ☺) I had seen there was a subreddit for atheism but I was actually afraid to click the links just in case this god was watching. Well after the wake I decided I needed to investigate the arguments against religion, so I started browsing r/atheism. Fast forward one year and I was a full-blown atheist that had a newfound love for science and space. (Very interesting chain of events now that I'm reflecting on it.)   So at the time I took LSD I was very anti-religion. That is an important point. Well, after chewing on the blotters and finally swallowing them a bit later we started to feel like we had ingested a good amount of caffeine. There was some nausea but with it came this welling of excitement between T and I. We couldn’t express ourselves quickly enough. The words would just flow out of us as we shared the deepest thoughts and feelings we could express. We could both talk and listen at the same time. It must have sounded like a chaotic conversation but we both could talk at the same time and still understand each other.   T had done LSD for the first time about 2 weeks earlier and I stayed sober just to be safe. He did 3 hits and talked incessantly about what sounded like really intense synesthesia but being sober I really didn’t get what he was trying to describe. Well I would find out this time why he couldn’t stop telling me every detail. I felt as though I was having a multi-dimensional trip. I had never really put thought into the idea of different dimensions but suddenly I could see every angle of these dimensions that continued to expand out. My brain felt like it was continually expanding outside of these “boundaries”. I couldn’t get the words out as fast as the images and ideas were hitting me. It was a fire hose of information.   There was this feeling of being on the verge of some kind of agreement or better understanding. After a couple hours of deep conversation we hit this point where our minds started illustrating the same picture for the both of us. We were having the same experience. We could see it all around us. Keep in mind that it didn't feel like a hallucination. It felt more real than my everyday life. It felt like truth. He described it very well when he said, “It's like we, humanity as a whole, are constantly zooming past each other in this system. No one really “seeing” one another but when you connect with someone in a real and meaningful way it’s almost like you really ""look"" at them. You feel something different. That feeling was like you were zooming past them and suddenly time slows just enough for a whispering ""hey"" and then they are whisked off on this grid we are constantly rocketing through. Well at that moment its like we had derailed from that system and were meeting our true selves for the first time. It felt like we could communicate from an entirely new and expanded perspective.  Only one of us need talk to express the ideas that we both had. I still don’t entirely understand what happened but it was as though we had found a mutual perspective that goes beyond just understanding what someone is saying. It was as though we were literally sharing a brain.   Then we started to talk about interacting with people from that perspective. It felt like our consciousness was in tier that was much greater than our everyday perspective. It felt as though I had always been just one piece of consciousness that was being influenced by a greater piece. If that was the case, could I use that “place” to interact with people everyday? I suddenly felt an immense connection and love for every human. I realized we are all god but only a miniscule piece in our current concept of reality. Here we were allowing ourselves to be distracted by the reality everyone agrees on when we could come at each other from this state of mind and experience real love and caring. We could work as a single unit.  That’s when it hit me. There is nothing. This whole experience, everything you touch, smell, see or hear, is all an illusion created by the brain. LSD is, in that sense, not a drug. It was simply a representation of a meeting with that greater being. It allows you to see reality for what it is in its whole form. Reality became similar to the static you would see on T.V. and the brain could simply organize small parts of the chaos of information that is the whole of everything. Not of this universe, not of this reality but of everything that was or could be. It starts to get tricky here. I lost that embodiment of myself. I knew my name and could recall moments but it was like talking about a character in a book. I couldn’t connect with it. I no longer existed. That’s when I felt that T didn’t exist either. He was a coping mechanism of experience, as was the rest of reality. Everything I had ever known was part of a façade I had created for myself. Reality was no longer subjective. Reality was loneliness. There was only a single consciousness and I had backed out so far that I could only connect with that single consciousness. That became reality.   When I looked at T his eyes seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of collapsing experience. I thought I was going to end a cycle that had been running infinitely. I knew what it meant to “be” everything. I felt so alone. This is where it really started to get terrifying. I had never heard of thought loops before but after researching I know that to be what I experienced next. It felt as though I was stuck in moments of time. I had broken reality and now I was stuck. This is when my anxiety reared its whole ugly head for the first time in my life. My heart was racing but not nearly as fast as my brain. T suddenly had a role and it was to balance me. I could now see that I had not created him but he was the embodiment of the yin to my yang. Keep in mind that I felt as though I was all that existed, so he was a force as great as I, not just a human body. I was all that was fearful, dark, and chaotic and he represented life, existence, and light.   We laid in my bed and he held me. I closed my eyes and saw all that ever was represented as a single unit of constant reaction within itself. It was almost like a great blob in a void. There was no outside of this blob. This blob represented the farthest out consciousness goes. (I don’t believe that to be the case now. I believe it is limitless and that my anxiety had closed it off.) I was the darkness rolling through the light, a great black hole moving through the universe. We became literal interpretations of Yin and Yang. When I was able to relax my mind for short spurts of maybe 5-10 seconds I could experience a sea of bliss that encompassed all of reality and all potentials of reality. It was on the grandest scale. I was in heaven for those moments. Then I would be shredded back into hell and reside in the darkness.  I experienced a thirst that I could not quench. I could not lie there for more than a few minutes before I had to pee. That lasted until I finally fell asleep. I was afraid that if I fell asleep that I would form a new reality and never return so I wouldn’t allow myself to relax to that point.  I hope that paints a picture not too convoluted and that you’re able to interpret. This was simply my experience and I believe everyone can experience it in his or her own unique way. We each have our own truths. Language is a tool not capable of relaying such an experience but I did my best with this, friend.  ",☺

You are literally the entire purpose of the Universe. God made the cosmos, the Earth, animals, everything, so his pet project, humans, could be ""tested"", and the endless tug-of-war between God and Satan is all about your ""soul"", nothing else.

She didn't engage anyone and so our peers decided she was a snob and the cycle began. She would try to engage someone in conversation, they would shut her down and call her uppity. I took a shortcut through the woods home and each day I would catch little glimpses of her smile and the twinkling of her laugh. She was so kind to animals and so carefree out here. I wished I could laugh with her and make her smile, but she is like a feral animal at any sign of affection she slowly retreats terrified of being hurt again. So I began to leave her presents, nothing extraordinary just a candy with her name attached or little note attached to a tree. The first couple times I saw her look at the presents and immediately destroy them. When you’ve been tricked and teased your whole life I suppose I could understand why she was mistrustful. After two weeks she began to unwrap and eat the chocolates, or put the barrette in her hair. Liah was a dark haired girl with majestic blue eyes. She was my future, if only I could get her to trust me. I began to write her in a journal. I would write to her and tell her how she was in my dreams, how she would take my hand and all my emotions would swell and slowly settle back like a tsunami that changed its mind. I left her that journal in the woods a month after the first time I saw her smile. And as she read the journal, she began to cry.    I don’t know if it counts as a story since there is no ending. It’s just a piece of a book I may or may not write ☺ ",☺

t5_2vizz,luxury_banana,1364275432,"&gt;False Rape Allegations by Eugene J. Kanin  &gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior  &gt;Feb 1994 v23 n1 p81(12)  &gt;False rape allegations. by Eugene J. Kanin  &gt;With the cooperation of the police agency of a small metropolitan community, 45 consecutive, disposed, false rape allegations covering a 9 year period were studied. These false rape allegations constitute 41% the total forcible rape cases (n = 109) reported during this period. These false allegations appear to serve three major functions for the complainants: providing an alibi, seeking revenge, and obtaining sympathy and attention. False rape allegations are not the a consequence of a gender-linked aberration, as frequently claimed, but reflect impulsive and desperate efforts to cope with personal and social stress situations.  &gt;© COPYRIGHT 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation INTRODUCTION  &gt;McDowell, Charles P., Ph.D. ""False Allegations."" Forensic Science Digest, (publication of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations), Vol. 11, No. 4 (December 1985), p. 64.  &gt;The study found that 60% of rape allegations are false. The study of 548 allegations was only undertaken after it was noticed that 20% of accusers later admitted they had lied. The researchers did not intially believe the 60% result and conducted two follow-up studies. The 60% finding held but political interference prevented publication.  Really though, the whole issue is so politicized today that it's nearly impossible to find anyone who really researches it now.  Bottom line is the presumption of innocence is often being overturned and when accusations of rape are made there's a kind witch hunt atmosphere surrounding things now.",©

Gosh, I guess that goes back to my childhood. Did you know that for the first two years of my life, my dad treated me like a cat? Seriously. I wasn’t permitted on the furniture, I had to bathe myself, and I was only allowed to poop in a box. Ironic that this all comes out in a bathroom. A place that for so long I yearned to be. This tiled prison that eluded my saddened grasp was a haven. The unreachable. When I finally did demand a bathroom visit, my dad applauded my moxie. And that’s the only time my father ever said he was proud of me. Maybe that’s why I stole credit for your drink. Maybe that’s why I needed to pour my heart out like this.

t5_2tdoc,redridingoops,1364303039,"* Hugs for you, would love to share a drink but i doubt we're in the same country =)  * You're perfectly right to be ""disgusted"" by your teacher's attitude, who somehow used his position as a way to appear ""trustful"" to you and your friend, then managed to try to get you drunk and to seduce your friend.  I'm not shaming anyone, but it seems quite unprofessionnal from him. To the point where i assume his job would be at stake if it was to leak outside of the private circle.   And i'd bet nobody would think of putting him in front of his responsabilities if that was to happen, but would rather shame your friend for ""hitting on the sex-ed and ruining his life""...  I guess i'm just being too cynical maybe =)  * Men's right is far from being a simple voice for men as in ""male gender"", it's a hating circlejerk blaming feminism and women in general for anything that happens to a male individual.  I'd never shame them for looking for same-sex sympathy, many of the most active's MRA's looks like they've been badly screwed at some point and it made them really really bitter. Now thhey're just blindly expressing their anger without really taking a step back and look at the bigger picture. Blaming feminists, and leftists and government or whatever for anything that happened to them.  * But on the other hand, just because feminism is a worthy ideology because of its premises doesn't mean the way it expresses in the society cannot be challenged.  The way i see patriarchy is that the whole society is made to favor men, through validating their ""typical"" feelings and actions, and on the other hand discourage or shame women who would act differently from the socially accepted norm.  When these differences become too extremes, resulting in phisical and or psychological harm directed toward women, measures have to be taken in order to stop it. (ie: laws for example)  I understand men could feel this as unequal because society vs laws are two different things, and some of them may be feeling anything happening to A woman will be treated as directed toward every women. (I'm absolutely not saying they're right to think so, but that's what i felt from reading many of their bullshit) While anything happening to A man will be treated as something happening to A man and no oppressive law or oppressive group will come to protect them from the evil striking them.  * They're not conscious of the way patriarchy works and of the way iit hurts them too...By making women seen as nurturers and mothers, thus pepetrating the ""unfairness"" against them in divorces, child's custody or whatever.  * They see it as feminism's accomplishment while it's just patriarchy's extension to gender's roles. (This also works with their infamous so called ""pussy pass"" and many other things)  * The main difference is their solution to these issues is just...Reinforing patriarchy and turn women into ""good women""...The kind of one that shut-up and obey.  * You're entitled to your opinions about Men's rights, you just have to decide wether you want to have a debate, knowing you will potentially be hearing some nasty stuff...And then just be patient as much as you can and try to explain if your debating partner is open-minded enough...Or decide you're not in the mood for teaching today and cut it short.  * You're free to disdain Men's Right and explain your reasons about it would be perfect. It could be a good to know if the person you're talking to is reasonnable enough to be worth chatting. =)  * You're not being too sensitive, well maybe a little but it's because you and them are NOT talking about the same thing.  * Rape culture is not only validating rape, actually it's the least bad part of it...The real danger of rape culture is not even ACKNOWLEDGING rape and dismiss so many things by saying ""Yeah rape is bad and stuff but what happenned to that girl WASN'T a rape at all ! Because reasons... (She was drunk/slutty/flirty/*insert common bullshit*)  * I'm more than willing to comprehend dark humor, even about rape, as long as i'm conscious of the irony. And i know the person joking is aware of the potential triggers and the seriousness of the issue he's joking about.  Hell, i've been making hilarious jokes about Hitler from time to time. It's not a war against humor, it's a war against the lack of it. Humor is a serious business, you cannot invoke humor when you're actually just insulting someone and magically not have to face any consequences...  * Now you're assuming women would be on your side while it's absolutely not the case...Patriarchy favors men, but in fact the system is maintained by both men AND many women. Some of them are more than satisfied of their situation in the current state of things.  Some of them are more patriarchal than men because of their education/religion or just because they've been eager to fit in, i've heard the nastiest stuff about rape apology and slut shaming in the mouth of women.  (Though i sometimes wonder if men aren't just withholding their thoughts because y'know...How could they have sex with a girl if they said bad things about their gender out loud?)  * Well feminism isn't something innate, and it's not well teached in our society. Proof is so many people don't even KNOW what feminism really is. (Just go recheck Men's right's dictionnary you evil female supremacist =D)  * Thus it requires some education if you want to understand the problem even remotely and understand all the implications of such deep roots in every aspects of society. If someone don't want to understand, you don't have to educate them at any cost.  Gender equality is more important to you than it is to them, they're free to care about what they want and not to care about anything else. If their attitude is too painful to bear for you, you should indeed stop hanging out with them. :)  * (i'm sorry about all the dots, but i'm still trying to figure out how to insert a line break. Once i post my messages they appear all squeezed and messed up &gt;&lt;)  * I hope i don't sound insensitive...I have decided a long time ago to take a very rationnal approach, it has prevented me from getting too emotionally affected a lot of times. =)  * Hugs² again srster. ♥",♥

t5_2r2jt,SlightlyAmused,1364311763,"This new not-the-""Harlem-shake"" abomination makes me unreasonably ill-tempered for the same reasons you mentioned. I, too, have a nostalgic attachment to the real Harlem Shake™ of the nineties, and I hate how no one even knows what it is anymore. Now ""Harlem Shake"" is synonymous with ""spazzing out aimlessly with no sense of rhythm or direction"".       True story: when I first heard about this new version, I hadn't thought of the harlem shake in YEARS so it immediately brought up memories from back in the day. I was so excited about (what I thought was) the Harlem Shake: Reloaded and I immediately got on youtube to check out the revival. The disappointment I felt when I saw what they'd done to it...it hurt. I wanted to throw YouTube out my window. Instead, I shut that shit off and looked up old videos of the real one and sulked about. And now my blood simmers a little in anger anytime I hear the words ""Harlem Shake"".       I mean, I'm down with evolving culture and terminology, but only when it goes in the right direction of improvement, not when it takes a regressive turn for the absolute worst. And especially not with a move as awesome as the Harlem Shake™, for fucks sake.",™

t5_2vij9,ssergni,1364312574,"Thanks berendhh ☺  So, some answers:  - I had five hours of commuting, every day, for almost a month. I had to do something with that time! It took a lot of work to understand, but building everything after that was very quick. It wasn't my first Android app by any means (although it's one of my best-organized), but it was my first major Python/App Engine site.   - I'd love to release the source code, but the potential fallout is just too great because of what it does and how it works. I'm considering opening up the server-side, but there's nothing surprising or exciting there.   - I used Java and Python. Oh, sorry... were those not the words you were expecting? ;-)  I don't want to go into a lot of detail about how I built this, as I don't want to give away any internal information. I'm sure there probably are other people working on this kind of thing, but the information won't leak from me — I love the game way too much, and I have a lot of respect for the Niantic team. I can confirm or deny some things, and I might drop some hits; but no more than that.  One thing I will say, however, is that this app **shouldn't** have caused any appreciable additional load on the Ingress servers. Its effect was almost exactly the same as a force-sync.",☺

[Epub ahead of print] Kava for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder RCT: Analysis of Adverse Reactions, Liver Function, Addiction, and Sexual Effects. Sarris J, Stough C, Teschke R, Wahid Z, Bousman C, Murray G, Savage K, Mouatt P, Ng C, Schweitzer I. Source  Department of Psychiatry, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Swinburne University of Technology, Centre for Human Psychopharmacology, Victoria, Australia; NICM Collaborative Centre for Neurocognition, Victoria, Australia. Abstract  Presently, little is known about a number issues concerning kava (Piper methysticum), including (i) whether kava has any withdrawal or addictive effects; (ii) if genetic polymorphisms of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 2D6 liver enzyme moderates any potential adverse effects; and (iii) if medicinal application of kava has any negative or beneficial effect on sexual function and experience. The study design was a 6-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (n = 75) involving chronic administration of kava (one tablet of kava twice per day; 120 mg of kavalactones per day, titrated in non-response to two tablets of kava twice per day; 240 mg of kavalactones) or placebo for participants with generalized anxiety disorder. Results showed no significant differences across groups for liver function tests, nor were there any significant adverse reactions that could be attributed to kava. No differences in withdrawal or addiction were found between groups. Interesting, kava significantly increased female's sexual drive compared to placebo (p = 0.040) on a sub-domain of the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), with no negative effects seen in males. Further, it was found that there was a highly significant correlation between ASEX reduction (improved sexual function and performance) and anxiety reduction in the whole sample.

t5_2qr7i,LordIntrepid,1364341895,"Since you asked.  For anyone who says that this is just satire and shouldn't be taken seriously: These very arguments have been used as serious lines of reasoning in many discussions. Making this less of a satire, and more of an attempt to express them in a misleading way.  In this thread:  People equating misandry and misogyny with rape and violence.  Hate of a gender is not the motivating factor to have sex with them against their will to satisfy your desire for sex with that gender. Using it in place of ""rapist"" in a sentence is the same as generalizing that anyone who dislikes a gender is going to rape them. **This is insensitive to actual victims.**  Hate of a gender is rarely enough of a reason to physically hurt/assault them, unless it is extreme, and in those cases its directed at a single person, or is a psychotic disorder..   Using the pretense of satire to spread misinformation and ideas. _____________________________________________________________________  On a personal note, this *satire™* does bring to light some differences in the way genders act.  &gt;""Men, are you worried for your own safety because misandry?  Safety is never guaranteed, regardless of time or place. Men are much less likely to equate offensive remarks or any kind of non-physical interaction as a threat to their physical safety. And since we don't equate ""misandry""(the hate or dislike of men) with rape or violence, no. Man up.  &gt;You need to accept that misandry happens in the real world and take some precautions.  Misandry, and *many other things* happen in *the real world*, so instead of complaining, I just take steps to feel safe in what I'm doing or where I'm going.I'd rather live life than fear it, as those things will ALWAYS exist (amounts may vary). Instead of complaining, that mommy said for me to be careful when I went to the park with friends, or to wear my helmet, or to not take candy from strangers in non-descript vans, or to not punch the bigger boy in the face, just because I don't like what he said (he will probably kick my ass if I did). Oh, and don't sign up to be an alter boy.  &gt;Take a self defense class, they’re only a couple hundred dollars a month.  Many men take self defense coarses. Some for fun, others for protection. What you don't hear is them complaining someone told them to do it for their safety. They tell them selves that.  &gt;Don’t go out after dark unless you have a woman to chaperone you. Misandrists are less likely to attack if they see you are with another woman.  Once again, ""Misandrists/Misogynists"" are not ""rapists"", this is muddying the word's meaning (and is sadly used frequently in that manner).The whole ""take a man with you"" thing stems from the fact men are physically stronger on average, are seen as the protectors because of it (also evolutionarily, reproductively disposable), and is a socialized response derived from that. Today we know that just going places as a group is safer, regardless of who is with you. So even men will group up to go through the seedy places in town.  &gt;Don’t wear anything too douchey.  Yes, the ""don't wear something if you don't want to be raped"" is getting old. Rapists don't care what your wearing, they where out to rape before they saw what you wore. This argument does need to end. So I'll give the *satire™* that point.  &gt;Don’t ever invite a woman into your home. Misandrists will interpret this as you consenting to physical violence.  I have no idea where that home invitation comment/parallel comes from. Fluff for the satire™?  &gt;Drinking increases your risk of being attacked by a misandrist. They target drunk men because their inhibitions are lowered.  Once again, its comparing hate of a gender with rape. This is a misguiding use of words, and makes hate of gender mean more than it actually does. If you replace ""misandrist"" with rapist, the sentences become true. Lessening your ability to make judgements and protect your self, will make you an easier target. This goes for anyone, man or women. It does not mean that it is the victims fault the rapist chose them, it just means they made a choice to be less responsible with their own safety.   &gt;Never leave your drink unattended. Misandrists are notorious for poisoning men at parties and bars.  The drink unattended is actually very true, especially for men, as people are far less likely to say anything, if they notice a woman doing it to a guy.  &gt;If a misandrist does attack you, be quiet and just let her finish or you might anger her further and you are liable to get murdered instead of just mutilated. But also, be sure to put up a good fight because a lot of men say they don’t want to be attacked by misandrists but deep down, they really like it.  This one is actually kind of awkward. Many men who have been reported as raped by a women did not fight back fro the simple reason that they where AFRAID they would hurt/injure them in doing so. Having those injuries would mean the rapist could argue they where the ones raped, and it would be an open and shut case, with the victim in jail.  Inversely, many convicted rapists have said that they are would never be able to rape a women who fights back, as it would leave to much evidence, or they simply did not wish to physically harm them. So there are some reasons to reminding people to always fight back (at least for women).  &gt;And remember, accusing a woman of abusive misandry is worse than being abused by a misandrist. So before you make accusations, make sure it wasn’t all just a silly misunderstanding.""  And of coarse this last one is just exacerbation for effect. Gotta have *some* satire in here.   But still, replacing ""rape"" and ""rapist"" with misandrist/mysogynist is a terrible muddying of the words and downplays real rape.   **tldr**:This whole satire is incredibly, insensitive to true/real victims.

The GT.M data model is a hierarchical associative memory (i.e., multi-dimensional array) that imposes no restrictions on the data types of the indexes and the content - the application logic can impose any schema, dictionary or data organization suited to its problem domain.* GT.M's compiler for the standard M (also known as MUMPS) scripting language implements **full support for ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) transactions**, using optimistic concurrency control and software transactional memory (STM) that resolves the common mismatch between databases and programming languages. Its unique ability to create and deploy logical multi-site configurations of applications provides unrivaled continuity of business in the face of not just unplanned events, but also planned events, including planned events that include changes to application logic and schema.  Worldwide, GT.M is used in multiple industries, including finance, health care, transportation, manufacturing and others. GT.M supplies the processing power to the FIS Profile™ enterprise banking application.  * Many popular database products impose relational or object-oriented schema within the engine itself. Database engines that do not impose schemas, but which allow layered application software to impose and use whatever schema that is appropriate to the application are popularly referred to as ""key-value"", ""document oriented"", ""schema-less"", ""schema-free"" or “NoSQL” databases.  FIS PIP is a **free /open source (FOSS) tool** with commercial support that has such a mapping capability and provides SQL/JDBC access. KB_SQL is a third-party product from Knowledge Based Systems.

How about this one? http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007995  &gt;The rat strain used in the study has been known to be prone to cancer during their lifetime, especially when they get aged. In a study by Nakazawa and co-workers consisting of 2 groups of 120 males and 120 females Sprague–Dawley rats, the same strain that were used in the study of Séralini et al., it was evidence that, under ad libitum, the rat developed tumors with an incidence ranges from 70% to 95.8% during their lifetime of 89–105 weeks (Nakazawa et al., 2001)   &gt;Next, nowhere in the paper the authors described the composition of different diets used in the study to indicate whether the diets were balanced with proteins, carbohydrate and lipids as well as other essential components. Most importantly, what were the levels of Roundup® residue in the GMO-containing diets and whether or not the corn used in the study were free from mycotoxins (especially aflatoxin B1, a cancer-causing toxin commonly found in badly stored corn).  .   &gt; Secondly, the toxicity of a poison is concentration-dependent, or in other words, it is the concentrations that make a compound poisonous, however, the data presented by Seralini et al. indicated that lower levels of GM corn (with or without R) in the diets were more toxic to the animals in their study than the higher ones (Seralini et al., Fig. 1, top &amp; middle panels). Similar phenomenon was also observed in the male group consuming Roundup® spiked in water (Fig. 1 lower panel) where **rats fed with highest concentration of Roundup® actually had longer lifespan than that of the control and that of the groups fed with lower concentrations of Roundup®**. Given the discrepancies of the data within the paper together with the lack of an appropriate statistical test, **any conclusions made are not supported by the data.** ",®

I meant that it's a gimmick that hasn't yet been fully realised, the technology is still developing.  &gt; the technology used is virtually identical  I disagree on this point too. Past iterations of 3D (even as recent as ten years ago) can't really hold a candle to what's currently hitting cinemas. Animals jumping out of the screen and so on are in my opinion truly gimmicky, and not really comparable to the more refined and subtle 3D of Avatar or Life of Pi.  The problems you've identified are undeniable, but who's to say that we won't have glasses-free 3D in the future? We already have it for handheld devices and televisions (which you sit a lot closer to than cinema screens, but still it's not a gigantic stretch of the imagination). That would solve a lot of the problems you've mentioned. Alternatively, maybe we'll just walk into the cinema and our Google Glasses™ will automatically kick into stereoscope mode, and adjust to our preferred intensity setting. One can dream.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1364396040,"  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  ",™

t5_2rnve,pinellaspete,1364408230,"Okay...Let's dig a little deeper.  Earlier I googled your computer to find the specs. Make sure the computer I am looking at is your computer. Look here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113089  The CPU on this computer is more powerful than the graphics card. This computer shows it has a Nvidea GT 120 graphics card. The computer does however have 8GB of RAM which is good even though it is 800 speed. It appears to me that a graphics card upgrade would boost performance. Usually pre-built computers will go the cheapest route with a graphics card when they build them.  The 7870 card is probably 4 times as fast as the GT 120 card you currently have in your computer. Its kinda overkill for this upgrade but it is something you could use in a new build if you did a new build within about a year.  What would you like to do? Buy a cheaper card now to boost and match your existing computer now, knowing that if you build a new computer later the card would be too slow for it, or buy a card that you could transfer into a new build?  I checked the requirements for DayZ and it seems that your CPU would be okay but the GPU is on the low end of the scale. The Nvidea GT 120 was released on March 9, 2009 so it is about 4 years old now. The CPU was released in August of 2008 so it is 4 and a half years old.  Here are the system requirement for DayZ:  DayZ Requirements (Hardware/Software)  Please note the below listed system requirements for DayZ:     Minimum:   OS: Windows XP or Windows Vista  Processor: Intel Core 2.4 GHz or AMD Dual-Core Athlon 2.5 GHz  Memory: 1GB  Graphics: Nvidia Geforce 8600GT or ATI Radeon 3650 or faster with Shader Model 3 and 512 MB VRAM  DirectX®: DirectX 9.0c  Hard Drive: 10 GB free space   Recommended:   OS: Windows 7  Processor: Intel Core i5 or AMD Athlon Phenom X4 or faster  Memory: 2GB  Graphics: Nvidia Geforce GTX 260 or ATI Radeon HD 5770 or faster with Shader Model 3 and 896 MB VRAM  DirectX®: DirectX 9.0c  Hard Drive: 20 GB free space",®

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1364410886,"  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)",™

t5_2ve1u,FAwhy,1364421923,"Hey guys let me know if i picked the wrong flair for this and i'll change it.   Also a few choice quotes::  &gt;I am now convinced that shy introverted men with few female friends are far far more likely to be sexist than their socially outgoing counterparts.  Yup more digs against beta males, while alpha social guys aren't seen as  misogynists.  &gt;Sometimes. I learned a lot about men's insecurities, but was never in doubt they had them. I have been reassured that a lot of my fears about men are true. I find a pretty strong undercurrent of sexism and bitterness running through there, so it's been making me really sad. I usually end up leaving there either depressed or riled up.  --------------  &gt;I think there's a huge difference between saying ""you hate men because you don't want to be approachen public"" or ""catcalls are compliments"" and saying ""you hate women because you are actually saying hateful comments about women""  ----------------------- &gt;[–]♀apriloneil 12 points 2 hours ago Yeah. I've learnt that most male Redditors seem to actively hate girls like me. permalinksavereportgive goldreply  &gt;[–]poop_grenade[S] 2 points 2 hours ago Well has that changed your view of men as a whole? or just reddit men? and what is a girl like you? permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply  &gt;[–]♀apriloneil 7 points 1 hour ago Reddit men, definitely. But I guess there's a difference between someone who posts on Reddit and a Redditor, y'know? Insofar as men in general; that's too broad to tell from such a small example. Me? I'm an overweight feminist with facial piercings and tattoos. I'm generally reminded of how revolting they find me in the weekly ""what do you find (un)attractive?"" thread. permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply   ",♀

t5_2rbnb,secretlyadog,1364444095,"I recommend you go over to BigSoccer.com and read every blog post by Bill Archer for the last 5 years.   Warner has, just off the top of my head, allegedly (because I don't want to be sued by his army of lawyers) stolen World Cup tickets and sold them through his travel company, stolen $$ given to him from FIFA meant for Haitian earthquake relief, pocketed the World Cup $$ meant for TnT players when TnT qualified for Germany's World Cup, used $$ given to him for TnT's Center of Excellence to build that center under HIS name (after he was fired he locked the TnT FA out and kept all their files and stuff, and has since refused to actually let them practice / host soccer events there), he organized the Great Caribbean Bribe-a-thon™ for Bin Hammam before the last World Cup ""vote"", and he is now (having been barred from soccer for life) being forced to make slightly less lucrative cons through his role in TnTs government, and it LOOKS like he has been laundering money by buying real estate in Florida (which is how his son got caught, for failing to declare he was carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's one of those silly questions they ask when you pass through customs).  Ever since the Bribe-Party in the Caribbean the FBI has been looking for ways to nail him because they are fairly certain he has been doing some his shady deals on US soil. Looks like they maaaay have finally gotten him. Although, since he is a foreign national and a government minister to boot (the head of TnT's version of the Justice Department [OH GOD, THE IRONY, IT BURNS!]) he will probably never see jail time. Just be barred from entry into the US. Maybe have some assets taken.  If he and his family all died tomorrow the world would be a better place. ",™

Erythritol is a non-caloric ingredient that provides bulk, crunch, and a crystalline texture for Truvía® calorie-free sweetener products. Erythritol has been part of the human diet for thousands of years as it is present in fruits such as pears, melons and grapes, as well as foods such as mushrooms and fermentation-derived foods such as wine, soy sauce and cheese. It is added to foods and beverages to provide sweetness, as well as to enhance taste and texture.

t5_2qh3l,whoopdedo,1364451818,"tl;dr   There are some new GMO crops that are currently undergoing review by the USDA. A judge had previously granted an injunction preventing the crop from being sold until the review is completed. Congress is now stepping in and overruling the judge. Final USDA approval is still pending which may still revoke authorization for the crop.  It's a bit sketchy as it amounts to the legislature stepping on the toes of the judiciary. But injunctions are a tricky business where you have to weigh the presumption of innocence against Bad Things™ happening if you don't stop the defendant from doing what he's doing.  It hardly rises to nefarious conspiracy though. This is business as usual. It was hardly done in an underhanded way. The American people do not need to be distracted from these things, they've time and again shown their willingness to voluntarily ignore the things Congress does.",™

t5_2qhwp,rotj,1364500404,"&gt;Just a few years ago, PAX barely had any competitive gaming presence at all, going as far as to ban Fatal1ty from attending at one point.  The context for the Fatal1ty ban:  The E For All expo announced that their 2008 expo would take place the same weekend as PAX.  They later changed the date because it was a stupid move, but shots were fired.  E For All put out a press release announcing Fatal1ty as the ""face"" of their Expo: &gt;World's Top Gamer ""Fatal1ty"" Returns to the ""Entertainment for All Expo"" (E for All) E for All will once again welcome E-sportsman Johnathan ""Fatal1ty"" Wendel to the event E for All 2008 FRAMINGHAM, Mass.—(BUSINESS WIRE)—IDG World Expo and Auravision, Inc., master licensor for the Fatal1ty brand, announced today that the world's most famous professional video gamer, Johnathan ""Fatal1ty"" Wendel, will be teaming up again with IDG World Expo to be the face of the 2nd annual Entertainment for All Expo® (E for All®), scheduled for October 3 – 5, 2008, at the Los Angeles Convention Center. ""We are excited to be back participating again at E for All this year,"" says Steve Gould, CEO of Auravision, Inc.

""There is no one else in the video game industry quite like Fatal1ty and we're thrilled he's returning to E for All,"" said Mary Dolaher, Chief Executive Officer of IDG World Expo, the leading producer of world-class tradeshows and events around the globe. ""He'll bring much excitement and attention to the show and we're eager to see him interact with the fans, which is what he does best."" ....

In the case of guns being bad as you mentioned, you have to remember that while you think guns are bad there are people, plenty of smart people too, who do not, who own guns themselves and enjoy being allowed to buy them, and unlike the creation debate or evolution or another area covered by hard science there's very little ground for you to declare yourself Right™ and them Wrong™ in a gun debate.  Best advice I can give you is to not shelter your children from other points of view.

t5_2qh3l,Dr_fish,1364527160,"This study quantified the lower limits of THC concentration that caused impairment while driving, which you might be able to compare to the lower BAC limits that cause impairment.  * [**Cognition and motor control as a function of Δ9-THC concentration in serum and oral fluid: Limits of impairment**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871606001372)  &gt;Twenty recreational users of cannabis participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study. Subjects were administered single doses of 0, 250 and 500 μg/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests measuring skills related to driving were conducted at regular intervals between 15 min and 6 h post smoking and included measures of perceptual-motor control (Critical tracking task), motor impulsivity (Stop signal task) and cognitive function (Tower of London). Blood and oral fluid were collected throughout testing. Results showed a strong and linear relation between THC in serum and oral fluid. Linear relations between magnitude of performance impairment and THC in oral fluid and serum, however, were low. A more promising way to define threshold levels of impairment was found by comparing the proportion of observations showing impairment or no impairment as a function of THC concentration. The proportion of observations showing impairment progressively increased as a function of serum THC in every task. Binomial tests showed an initial and significant shift toward impairment in the Critical tracking task for serum THC concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml. At concentrations between 5 and 10 ng/ml approximately 75–90% of the observations were indicative of significant impairment in every performance test. At THC concentrations &gt;30 ng/ml the proportion of observations indicative of significant impairment increased to a full 100% in every performance tests. It is concluded that serum THC concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml establish the lower and upper range of a THC limit for impairment.  This study compared dosages of THC with BAC in driving impairment.  * [**Marijuana, Alcohol and Actual Driving Performance**](https://psy.psych.colostate.edu/Research/Fall/article8.pdf)  &gt;The objective of the current study was to assess the separate and combined eects of marijuana and alcohol on actual driving performance. Eighteen subjects were treated with drugs and placebo according to a balanced, 6-way, crossover design. On separate evenings they were given weight calibrated D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) doses of 0, 100 and 200 mg/kg with and without an alcohol dose sucient for achieving blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 004 g/dl while performing a Road Tracking and Car Following Test in normal trac. Main outcome measures were standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), time driven out of lane (TOL), reaction time (RT) and standard deviation of headway (SDH). Both THC doses alone, and alcohol alone, signi®cantly impaired the subjects performances in both driving tests. Performance de®cits were minor after alcohol and moderate after both THC doses. Combining THC with alcohol dramatically impaired driving performance. Alcohol combined with THC 100 and 200 mg/kg produced a rise in SDLP the equivalent of that associated with BAC009 and 014 g/dl, respectively. Mean TOL rose exponentially with SDLP. Relative to placebo mean RT lengthened by 16 s under the combined in¯uence of alcohol and THC 200 mg/kg. Changes in SDH ranged between 09 and 38 m. Low doses of THC moderately impair driving performance when given alone but severely impair driving performance in combination with a low dose of alcohol.  This study also compared the two.  * [**Effects of THC on driving performance, physiological state and subjective feelings relative to alcohol**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457507001935)  &gt;Both levels of THC cigarettes significantly affected the subjects in a dose-dependent manner. The moderate dose of alcohol and the low THC dose were equally detrimental to some of the driving abilities, with some differences between the two drugs. THC primarily caused elevation in physical effort and physical discomfort during the drive while alcohol tended to affect sleepiness level. After THC administration, subjects drove significantly slower than in the control condition, while after alcohol ingestion, subjects drove significantly faster than in the control condition. No THC effects were observed after 24 h on any of the measures.  ",®

You are right that it is explicitely mentionned that you have to be ""slave to Christ"".  1 Corinthians 7:22 New International Version (©2011) For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ's slave.  Being a slave to Christ is the only way to be totally free.  Of course, your first reaction will be ""What the fuck is this shitty christan explanation for another non-sense part of the Bible"".

t5_2qh03,eXidus,1364582625,"Nuketown 2025 was a Pre-Order bonus only. The copies left that still have that on the case are just left over from the initial launch. If you had bothered to even do research before posting you would have found that out no problem. Now the code itself may have come inside the game for pre-order hence why it still states it's available on the case. But odds are you just bought an original launch copy of the game and you bought it used so it's not going to be available.  So, the seller you contact is just stupid, period.  Also, you really have no right to be pissed either if you bought a used copy and expected it to have pre-order bonus codes available still.   This really has nothing to do with Activision or their service, it has everything you do with you not having any idea what you're doing or talking about.   Call me harsh all you want, but don't make a post before finding out all the facts it just makes you look stupid.   * http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Is+nuketown+2025+only+a+pre-order+bonus%3F  * Q.

Fans who pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops II now will get the Nuketown 2025 downloadable bonus map when Call of Duty: Black Ops II releases this November 13th.  If you already pre-ordered the game then you’re all set, and you will be able to download the bonus map when Call of Duty: Black Ops II launches.   * Q:  How do I make sure I can get Nuketown 2025?  * A. Nuketown 2025 will be available to any customer who pre-orders their copy of Call of Duty: Black Ops II at participating retailers worldwide.

t5_2qio8,Sylvanas_Windrunner,1364584954,"My Blood Knight is a very stoic, uptight character. She was training to become a priestess, much to her father's chagrin. He was a Farstrider, and hoped she'd become one as well, frequently taking her on low-risk mundane missions.   She's a young adult now, but old enough to remember the Scourge Invasion striking Silvermoon City. She lost her family in that (Scourge Happens™), and decided after that she felt it'd be a better idea to become a Blood Knight, to better protect the city and her loved ones.  While she's pretty serious most of the time and generally has a pretty dry sense of humor, she does have a penchant for finding herself in bizarre situations (like rescuing a pregnant friend from an accidental gladiator cage match in Gadgetzan).   She loathes the Forsaken (back to that whole Scourge Happens™ thing), and while she's wise enough not to act on her hatred of them, sometimes she has to keep it in check. (This is something I'm working on IC-for her to drop the racism at some point. I wanted the character to have some conflict.) She's not particularly pleased about the fact that the Blood Elves joined the Horde because of the fact it meant allying with the Forsaken, and she finds them disgusting and reprehensible.

Wait outside for couple of days, familiarise with his in/out squejual. Check well surrounding, it's the key moment, remember all the alleys, streets, corners, stores, fire exits, etc. Dress in something that attracts less attencion, casual shirt, jeans, jacket, and something to conceal a weapon, suitcase, flowers, newspaper, etc. Day before, hide spare cloth set somewhere on your escape route. Wait for moment when there is no much people around, get behind him, 3 stabs (Hearth, Lung, Lung) or 2 shots (Chest, Head) and go to dead-spot where you hid your spare cloths. Quick, clean, no one remember a thing in confussion.  ☢ Advices: Flowers and saturated-colored plastic bags are good to hide a firearm. Flowers, because they got less attencion on you, people think that staring at guy on date is a bit awkward thing to do and plastic bags can help you to hold the gun on plain sight, without anyone knowing it, just be sure to dress in something with long slees to cover the gun grip. If you don't want your face to be seen (Not a big concern if you are operating in different city), use big dark shades and red scarf. Color red will take attencion from your face, to your neck.

Without it I have no access to the PC that runs all the old classic era mech games (MW2, MW3, MechCommander, G-nome) and that just takes half the fun out right there.  Specifically, I need an Iogear® GCS72U like this one the one linked below because it has a remote, Supports sound, usb, and is VGA.  Anybody got one of these they're not using? http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesProductDisplay?storeId=10001&amp;catalogIdentifier=2&amp;partNumber=IM1BX0272&amp;langid=-1&amp;cid=PS:GooglePLAs:IM1BX0272&amp;KPID=IM1BX0272  *2 hatch struts 21"" in length or less which have a 65 lb lift capacity combined.  Preferably with mounting brackets.  That hatch is heavy enough to kill someone if it falls.  It needs these.  I made it way too heavy and have to lift it to get in or out which can be tricky.  *Some sort of latching mechanism that could be pulled to release the hatch as if it had struts it would rise on its own.  I was thinking of going to a junkyard to scavenge a car's Trunk Prisoner release T-handle.  Then I could put two rope loops on it and make it release by reaching overhead and pulling it, a la Vietnam era ejection seats.    *Some 1"" wide urethane non-swiveling casters.  The kind you find on a rolling toolbox where one end swivels and the other doesn't.  Heavy duty-like.  The plastic chair casters are not up to Draconis Combine specs.  *3 or 4 Green 12v LED light strips of 10 or 12 lights each like these kids these days use to light up the guts of their gaming PC's.  The light fixture I have in there now is heavy and I need it to GO.  Plus it requires 120v AC and I don't want any of that in there closer to me than my feet.  *I really need to get an automotive seat and adjuster frame to put in it because the one that's in there is one of those old cheap Wal*mart video rockers suitable for a 10 year old.  I've added padding and a cover made of my old ruck-sack cover but I'm a grown-ass man with a bit of weight on.  It hates me.  Whatever kind of seat would have to be NARROW.  *Some 1"" thick styrofoam sheeting.  I am going to cover the exterior in this stuff to emulate armor plates and cover up some of the horrible chip=board texture.    *One can each: dark red latex paint and some light grey latex paint.  Well, that was shameless begging, wasn't it?  Well HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT THIS THING BUILT with NO MONEY!  Charity and Pity, Sir!     For those of you too proud to beg, you still have your pride.  I have a Battlemech Simulator.  Please don't judge me.  I appreciate all the good comments.  It was some work.

CTRL+A and delete won't clean the residue left over by the unwanted folders. If you really want a clean computer, you'll want to take the whole computer and give it a good scrub down. The easiest way is to just take it in the bath with you but you'll need to make sure its plugged in because if the HDD isn't spinning, it won't get all the residue off.      permalink     parent     report     give gold     reply  [–]ColdSauce 3 points 12 hours ago  I followed all the instructions and I got my dick stuck in the computer fan..

I didn't notice my mistake (it was a sort of messy way I was calculating how many to make), and just decided to multiply it by 100. Then I noticed my mistake, but forgot to take out the x100.

Most of the leading experts have moved away from the Paleo™ label and some of the 'appeals to nature' arguments you mentioned.  Chris Kresser had this to say in [his article on Dairy](http://chriskresser.com/dairy-food-of-the-gods-or-neolithic-agent-of-disease):  &gt;We can look to the Paleo era to determine what was evolutionarily normal for humans, but it doesn’t follow that anything that falls outside of that norm is automatically harmful. The argument that we shouldn’t eat dairy now because we didn’t eat it 2 million years ago – without supporting clinical evidence – is not convincing.   I would, however, be remiss to mention that just because something gives us a survival advantage (i.e. Lactase Persistence) does not mean it is ""very, very healthy.""

t5_2rnve,Mistywing,1364667824,"1. I know this motherboard is Z75 chipset, but I would not recommend overclocking on it. It is a budget mATX board which means it has very little in terms of CPU power delivery components, just enough for it to run at stock speeds basically. Overclocking boards usually double up on the power delivery for the CPU to make it more stable and reduce the chance of failures happening.  2. Thermal paste in this quantity is not needed for this build. You will use one tube for many builds. Also, the CPU fan/heatsink you buy will probably come with thermal paste of its own, so you probably don't need to buy some extra. Verify packaging contents.    3. The storage capacity you chose fails to meet your requirements.    4. I would be wary of taxing a fanless PSU such as this build would under full load. The PSU itself is great of course, but perhaps not the best suited for the build it's going in.    If you will not be overclocking the CPU, here is what I propose. If you wish to retain overclocking capabilities, I will propose something else, however it will be more expensive.   The Xeon CPU is the same as the 3770K, except without the K or Intel HD Graphics and is therefore much cheaper, almost the price of an i5.    Cheaper RAM.    1TB of storage.    Cheaper video card.    A PSU that I wouldn't be as afraid to stress out. It is semi modular, but you will use all of the attached cables anyways.

t5_2qkog,Girlwithnousername,1364683042,"I wasn't suggesting you were, no worries.   From my last experience, it depends on where and how the money was spent.   I was withdrawing cash and making card transactions in supermarkets in London and someone else was exchanging currency on my card in Hong Kong. The bank accepted that as fraud and refunded it almost immediately. However, at the same time, someone else was spending my money on Just-eat.co.uk, a retailer I'd frequently used until a flat move six months prior (this was then considered a 'retailer dispute' rather than outright fraud). So, that took nine months, (and including the HK thing), 21 sets of correspondence and me sending a complaint to the financial ombudsman in the end because I was sick of it; they credited a refund and then debited it again two or three times. For info, the ombudsman service are shit. But copying them into correspondence from the offset (as I should have, in hindsite) will get you a much speedier result.   If they're not a retailer you've previously used then you are fine, but if they are, well, good luck to you (especially if you bank with NatWest).   I’d been with them for 20 years and this shit made me eventually decide to leave (for which I got £220 compensation – so my service was worth just over a tenner a year to them).

During his 40-year career Bass worked for some of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese. Amongst his most famous title sequences are the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm for Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm, the credits racing up and down what eventually becomes a high-angle shot of the C.I.T. Financial Building[1] in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and the disjointed text that races together and apart in Psycho. Bass designed some of the most iconic corporate logos in North America, including the AT&amp;T ""bell"" logo in 1969, as well as AT&amp;T's ""globe"" logo in 1983 after the breakup of the Bell System. He also designed Continental Airlines' 1968 ""jetstream"" logo and United Airlines' 1974 ""tulip"" logo which became some of the most recognized airline industry logos of the era.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIlqatMQSgI",♥

Can't really be the Element of Generosity, living your life to help others, if you are thought useless and left all alone. So, take her, isolate her, convince her that her friends have abandoned her, and break her.  (edit) Actually, now that I think about it: She fears being abandoned, being not appreciated for the beauty she brings forth. That sounds *awfully* familiar, does it not?  [](/raritysad)At least, that is what I expect the Nightmares will do to her. They once broke an immortal princess, and however brave Best Pony™ Rarity is (and we know she can be fierce, when the mood takes her), I fear that she will eventual succumb to the brutality of the onslaught.

t5_2s8bl,nobouvin,1364691542,"I really, really liked this issue. As great as the first arc was, I think this is shaping up to at least match it, if not supersede it. We have delicious darkness, we have significant world building about Nightmare Moon, we have both princesses, and Luna playing an active part (and striking dramatic poses!). We have miss Dash being a hero and an (earnest) idiot. We have Twilight Sparkle looking as cute as ever. We have Best Pony™ Rarity centre stage, probably going to turned into Nightmare Rarity, once she has been broken by the Whoosie Things.  I believe that Rarity's nightmare was the one closest in nature to what haunted Luna. They are both artistic, bringing beauty forth in the world, and they both fear(ed) being under appreciated and abandoned. How can you give, when you are shunned? Thus, the Whoosie Things took that which was most familiar to them, because Bad is Dumb.  The art style is bolder, which suits the ponies well (I really like Price's art, but this also works).

t5_2qh1i,luxury_banana,1364738697,"So one case ""proves"" everything? Despite that just about every other highly televised case was full-on rush to judgement of assumed guilt-- some cases off the top of my head are the Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Duke Lacrosse, and Hofstra university cases. Even the completely unproven allegations of rape and abuse of one case I can recall when I was a small child, that of when John Waybe Bobbit had his dick cut off, were taken at face value and assumed to be true. It seems that in almost every case that hits the media, the exact opposite of what you claim is true happens.  There are mountains of empirical data that show that victims are disproportionately young in the prime of their physical attractiveness and that offenders are disproportionately poor, inner-city men (i.e. those least likely to get sex). The reason empirical data matters is because it helps determine the how and why, rather than the ""this is how it is because I say it is"" just-so posits that you're making here, which have no basis in anything objective. There's not even any correlation to real data in what you're saying.  If we're really honest about things, we know that a relatively small percentage of the population are sociopaths that will not listen to anything you tell them and will do whatever it is they want to do, including rape and murder and should be dealt with individually. These kinds of people are from all walks of life and it's unfortunate they exist.  We'd also acknowledge that alcohol-fueled hookups and the subsequent regret tend to make up a lot of these other controversial issues, but of course no one wants to honestly talk about these things because of hurt fe-fes. You'd rather blame it on *The Patriarchy™*-- --whatever that is, that amorphous boogeyman--which doesn't make sense because men used to be strung up and hanged to death on the mere accusation of rape under what you call ""patriarchy.""  This one case (Stuebenville) and a one-off deleted account reddit comment that may have just been a troll must just disprove all that data though, because the plural of anecdote is data in your world, apparently.  &gt;if you're living in the US, rape isn't actually declining so we're having this argument for nothing.  Oh? The per capita rates sure seems to reflect this reality that the rate has been declining steadily for decades... unless of course you'd like to use expanded definitions of rape, like you're trying to do here by classifying things like drunk hookups and the recent hubbub about post-facto ""this sex wasn't satisfying ergo rape"" rationalizations under the same umbrella as actual rapes.  Your entire post is contradictory not only of itself but of the post I first replied to, but that is an aside so I'm just going to say here: **paragraphs**. Your disjointed, rambling post makes even less sense when it's a wall of text.  Finally, your idea that telling men to not rape ""does work"" is preposterous, and to prove that I'll point you to a male feminist loony well versed in the ""It's all *The Patriarchy!*"" dogma you're espousing here that went on to do some really fucked up shit, [one Kyle Payne](http://iowaindependent.com/?s=2540&amp;key=old_id).

So I let you guys know a few days ago I was in search for a Jungler that would be capable of living in Germany - it wasn't clear to me whether or not it would be a requirement to replace me or not.. more that I was considering options at the time.  Two years ago I delved into an eSports career head first, dropping everything in my life - taking a huge risk and even making no money at the time. I seized an opportunity and have had the best two years of my life and shared with some amazing people and for that I'm extremely grateful.  The next chapter in my life is a personal goal of mine which you guys helped me reach over the past few months and it was being part of a space program that Lynx was running :- https://www.lynxapollo.com/en_IE/98067/stephen-ellis  I was contacted by Lynx a week ago saying that I qualified as the first person to represent the UK in the boot camp being that I was the ""legit"" first place (the current #1 is Moot from 4Chan who did it as a joke). The problem is that it is extremely time intensive and I will be 1 of 200 people trying to get the spot to fly into space.. it is going to be extremely competitive.  You might think I'm crazy dropping what I right now to pursue it.. the same was said to me when I go into eSports. I'm extremely motivated and I'll be starting the program at the end of April at a boot camp in England (Surrey). It's going to take months of training, it's going to be crazy but I will keep you guys updated on the entire process.  This isn't announcing my departure from eSports.. I would love to come back - I'm fascinated by the industry and the people I've met a long the way .. not to mention the fantastic support the community &amp; fans have shown me over the 2 years.  I will be playing LCS in the upcoming weeks but Malunoo (ex Dragonborns) will be substituting for me in the mean time and living with the team in Germany. It's not decided yet if he will play this upcomming weeks LCS or the following week.. we are establishing that when the entire team gets home.

I don't feel *the call*™ yet to have kids, and there's many reasons why anyone could not have babies, my favorite is: there's enough people in the world already. I mean, I could save children who are already alive to grow up and study, what else.  I don't like kids, I've never liked them. Some babies are fine, but there's an age (around 3 - 11 yo) where they are horrible.  I don't have the best genes, I have depression issues.  I still haven't enjoyed myself, my life, my husband enough to say ""yep, time to give myself to a little me"".  I don't have the economical status I would like to raise a child with.  I've been overweight all my life (working on it), I don't want to engage in a pregnancy if I never reach my goal weight, it would be more difficult to get to that later.  Many people here don't like if someone says ""you may change your mind"". But as you, I'm totally open if I feel like it's time to have children, never say never. Right now, no thanks, damn kids.",™
