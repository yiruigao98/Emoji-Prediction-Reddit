t5_2vk9t,lotusQ,1375316648,"Yes, that was me who said that. White, Ashzekanzi Jews, have white privilege. Even if you're black, but look white, at first glance a racist cop will see and check the one box: ☑White. A cop will less likely profile you. You are less likely to fall under racist black/brown stereotypes. I'm light-skinned, or as someone here once coined it ""yellow bone[?]"", and I admit my privilege in society as well. Just like what /u/neverkidding says about that video ""where a light-toned black woman was being granted white privilege in a grocery store, and used it to stand against the unfair treatment of her black sister-in-law.""  It is what it is. It's the ""*vile*"" reality of things. I'm sure others here can/will explain this more eloquently than myself.",☑

t5_2skrn,hyper_focus,1375323147,"I can see you're trying to share your view with me from a place that isn't sarcastic. You're trying to let me know how you viewed the joke.  I am going to let down my sarcasm for the moment in return:  &gt; Men who masturbate were the butt of the joke.   OK. But the manly man is saying he still masturbates in a woman. I can't quite get my head around the fact that this is making a woman into a pleasure object. I am not being condescending, but for me, masturbation and sex are worlds apart.   &gt; Women were only mentioned because consensual heterosexual sex can't exist without them participating.   If you want to know what it might feel like for the side characters of this joke, the side characters are there to serve the main characters, being the manly man (and those who are not manly men). It has very little to do with the woman in question, and when the woman is presented, she is nothing but a substitute for masturbation. This is kinda insensitive and makes the joke maker look kinda like he/she doesn't view women as main characters.  &gt; That's the joke. A manly man is able to have consensual heterosexual sex and those who can't do that have to masturbate.  If the joke was about sex, like, both man and woman interacting, it would have said something like,   ""I don't masturbate; I have sex.""  To frame it as ""masturbating inside a woman,"" it is still about the man and the man's fulfillment of his pleasure. The woman is a means to that end. It ain't about sex.   The bad part of this is: it confounds sex/intercourse with masturbation-orgasm. It makes a woman the object by which a Real Man™ differentiates himself from Masturbating Losers™. The woman is a means to that status as Manly Man, and those who do not have a woman to masturbate into are not Manly Men™.  Rip me apart if you want. That's how I feel. This is probably where we will not see eye to eye, and where I will be framed as ""reading too much into things,"" and in need of ""lightening up,"" and being a sourpuss that is bringing the quality of the r/nofap subreddit experience down for the rest of the gang, and that I'm fronting as a chivalrous misogynist who believes these things because I think women are helpless.  But it's about who the main characters are, who the side parts are, and what function and role each person plays in the narrative, however lighthearted, however facetious, however mindlessly it was created.",™

You guys then open the books on the corresponding anniversary.  Copied this for [another guestbook idea](http://www.frostedpetticoatblog.com/2012/10/succulents-cream.html) where your guests can take polaroids of themselves and instantly add them to an album.  There's a cute idea for favours too though.  [Love this - a questionnaire for your guests!](http://pinterest.com/pin/572590540094266639/)  This is fun for them to do and would be CHEAP for you to create yourselves.  It's always a good idea to save money somewhere when planning a wedding ;)  **Favours**  [Jars of sweets personalised for the guest with a label](http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/the3blondebears/product/personalised-wedding-favour-sweetie-jars)  You can get small spice jars from Ikea or similar for less than £1 and then add ribbon.  [Another sweets idea](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/99/34/0d/99340d98fa4afa54203c08fb93ad9863.jpg)  This will take all the prep work out of it for you too!  [Seed favours](http://gallery.weddingbee.com/photo/seed-favors#axzz2ahIUed8x)  Last one - some [cute ideas http://scraptasticfunandotherramblings.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/one-about-handmade-wedding.html) including using mini potplants as table decorations and favours.  For flowers, have a bouquet for the bride, a buttonhole for the groom and look at the many, many ways of doing centrepieces for tables without expensive flowers.  Speaking as a guest of a wedding, I couldn't care less about expensive centrepieces - the large ones just get in the way so you can't see people across the table!  A nice idea is to get cheap clear vases and fill them with stones then add candles - it gives a nice atmosphere.  Good luck for the big day and remember - the stress of planning a wedding is 99% bullshit.  Your guests are there to share your happiness and (Scotland here, so this might be cultural!) get blind drunk.  They will give not a fuck for many of the things that brides to be agonise about.

I have a feeling that he'll be replacing either Rohit or Karthik soon.  I think so much of Pujara that anything less than a 50 on his début would be a disappointment.

t5_2w2s8,MdxBhmt,1375346280,"Your argument sounds quite 'we didn't develop new genres of gamming, so we didn't evolve'  Think of literature. It's not developing new genres that is evolution, but How You Do It™  Frankly, if you put a modern game side by side a 2000 game, you'll fell the difference in polishing. They are, in most cases, more fluid, comfortable to play, streamlined.   FPS got ridden of the health bar. This, hated by hardcore gamers, is an incredible tool for level designers. Designers are free to create multiple sequences of intensive combats. They don't have to worry about the player health management. It is also forgiving on the players mistakes. No more reset-the-level-because-I-lost-too-much-hp.  L4D has health, but has this concept for ammo. In case a player waste too many bullets in despair, the pistol has infinite ammo. The player is not a useless piece of digital meat if he does a mistake.  See, those tools (unlimited ammo, health regen) are not 'new', but we are now understanding better their implications in design. Designers can concentrate more on what they want the player to feel.  We also evolved on more informative UI's, how to teach new players, story telling mechanics.  Take the discovery of achievements for example. It's a wonderful guiding tool. If I got an achievement I must be doing something right, no? This help the player discover new things, or telling him that he is indeed progressing in the game, without being invasive (it's a meta tool)  One of the major problems is that not even half players reach the end of a game. [I'm serious.](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4171/staying_power_rethinking_feedback_.php) Game design is evolving around to fix this.  Maybe they get stuck, or demotivated,  and we are making tools to make you play that game.  Look at Braid master level design. The mixing of story telling by level design, game mechanics and graphics. The way it teaches you how to manipulate time, and how it hints puzzle solving.  Bastion, and a dynamic narrator and pleasant gameplay.  Amnesia, revamped survival horror with a combatless hero, giving you chills with terrific level+story design.  TF2, created an addicting formula for the old FPS team game. It's been 6 years and the player base never stopped increasing.  Metal gear, and how the mechanics evolved with the series.  Or take Cs 1.6 and compare to CS:GO. I bet you can quickly feel what a decade had brought to game design.  Darn I bet this can go forever if I search for more examples.  W3 and SC2 are two different beast. How it teaches the game metas (purpose of a unit, strategies), better interfaces, how the story telling is interwinded with game mechanics (you can see the difference on SC2  WOL against SC2 HOTS), SC2  is much more polished.  I can't talk about MMORPS, but MOBA games came from there. Dota2, HoN, LoL, they by themselves are evolving the genre in different ways. Better item/heroes balancing, game pacing...  __  Tl;Dr: We are evolving. Game designers are working on making games more entertaining, more involving, more polished, less stressful, less turn-down.  ___  A very good series to learn about game design is [extra credit](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/show/extra-credits). I've not seen them all but they are very informative.  BTW, I Used We a lot, but by no means i'm a game designer.",™

t5_2rqrv,jamesc7,1375365064,"In the comment section of this article he added this:   ""Whoever you are, thank you for reading this. It is of crucial importance that we ALL become as aware as possible of the things that threaten the true freedoms that we all hold dear. Allow me to further explore a few details that the good Mr. Hinton did not explain...   First of all, the raid in question was based on a search warrant obtained by the officer in charge, M.D.Ognosky, who claimed that he saw a ""marijuana plant"" through the window of the house. The simple fact is that there was no actual marijuana plant - the room contained squash, oregano and cilantro plants (one of the cilantro plants was directly inside the window). Ognosky still attempts to maintain that he ""saw a marijuana plant"", which of course conveniently was not there the VERY NEXT DAY after the warrant was obtained.     In addition, the jar of ""marijuana"" (I use quotes here because it was actually already-vaporized leftovers of what USED to be marijuana - material that most people throw in the garbage) and the bong were in the cluttered basement of the house - not exactly a ""common area"" - and Ognosky stated explicitly that I ""wouldn't have to worry about being charged for them as long as my room was clean"". Of course, this was before he was able to make the mistake about the medicinal mushroom in my bedroom, which in turn allowed him to call my dietary scales ""paraphernalia"" and pair them up with the garbage in the basement, which further allowed him and his friends to be FAR more successful at coming up with enough felony charges to validate blowing in the door of a house for a cilantro plant.    The remark in the article about ""two scrapes"" on my face doesn't really do justice to the injury. The entire right side of my face was road-rashed after I was tackled to the ground, which they said was ""because I had camouflage pants on"" (watch out, veterans)... and yes, it took two entire months for my face to heal. My comment about this being the most traumatic experience of my life was not just about the tackling part or the facial injury - in fact, these were relatively tame compared to being unlawfully imprisoned for a seemingly indefinite period of time while being forced off a ten year regimen of anxiety meds.    And as far as the ""probable cause hearing"" is concerned, this is a right GUARANTEED to every defendant by virtue of NC Statute 15A-606. The thing is, apparently they ""just don't do those"" here in Forsyth county, despite what the book says, because the courtrooms are already ""too crowded"". I wonder why? Could it be because of ridiculous things like this? Hmm...    So, basically, the police here screwed up twice: once when they were so sure the ""confidential and reliable"" informant's claims were true that they thought they could just invent a pot plant that didn't exist and still somehow be ok, and again when their realization of the first mistake made them act in desperation to create charges that allowed these supposed ""drug task force"" officers (who couldn't identify an illegal plant) to misidentify a completely legal mushroom, even when I politely explained the mistake to them in detail. A 1-minute Google search, as I explained at that time, could have easily accomplished what an 8+ month wait for the SBI ended up having to.    Finally, I would like to add that the PD's continued desperation to validate these completely unnecessary actions resulted in them having the gall to suggest to me that because I'd admitted to having a puff or two of marijuana while in the house, that I should accept everything else that happened as normal police procedure. I won't even go into detail here about how wildly inappropriate this suggestion is. Again, I believe it to be of vital importance that we stay aware of the threats to our freedom and learn to politely assert our rights whenever possible. I honestly believe that for the most part, these officers believed they were doing the right thing. Even the one in charge was probably blinded enough by his own overzealousness to misidentify the plant in the window. But this is not ok, and what is even less ok is that I was treated as if I was guilty FIRST, which threw the axiom of ""innocent until PROVEN guilty"" - which our system claims to be based on - right out the window.     Don't turn against the police here. Many of them are just acting in fear; don't feed that. Just be aware of what is happening, know your rights, and don't be afraid to politely assert them. Ask questions, demand answers, and don't just bow to them because they wear a badge. It does NOT mean they are ""above"" you. We are all equal. Be polite, and remember that compassion is paramount - even when it is not shown to you.    Thank you for reading, and have a blessed day ♥""",♥

Here is Dewar's explaination from their site:  *It takes an original to craft an original. We start with iconic DEWAR’S® WHITE LABEL Blended Scotch Whisky and infuse it with Scottish honey, harvested from bees near the Aberfeldy distillery, and other natural flavors. The result is pure harmony. DEWAR’S® Highlander Honey is a perfect blend of complementing characteristics. It’s traditional, but strikingly modern.*  [This ""spirit drink"" riled up the SWA.](http://www.just-drinks.com/news/scotch-whisky-association-raises-concerns-over-dewars-highlander-honey_id109859.aspx)  [Here is the label.](http://whiskycast.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Dewars_Honey_labels.png )  [And..Don't forget this epic commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaBUfbKHlu0)   Well, on to it.  **Dewar's Highlander Honey**  *$19, 40%abv*  * Color: E150  * Nose: Well there is honey, nail polish remover, malt, grain, lemon candy  * Taste : Very light mouthfeel, honeyed burnt sugar, citris, alcohol burn  * Finish : The shortest finish I have ever had. Honey, lemon, alcohol tang.  *55/100    Easily the worst scotch or spirit I have ever had. I can't even comprehend how this could be used as a mixer.  The sweetness is so artificial its off-putting. This is undrinkable in my opinion.  It baffles me how Dewar's can make a respectful blend like the 12 year old and also make this.

t5_2sc5r,ravia,1375371219,"People often get in a mode of thinking about philosophy according to these general rubrics. Such thinking, it seems, is nothing but a mundane matter of viewing a kind of catalog or directory, in terms of departments and general views gleaned from course offerings and casual opinions, that give you a view of how it is regarding philosophy, education and publications. What's in, what's out, what's living, what's dead. You might then pick up on this or that pointer, realizing that this or that rubric is more operative here or there. All the while, you will have been pondering something interesting: that philosophies can die, or appear dead, or live, or appear living. They may flourish and grow, dwindle, go bankrupt, go unrecognized or become robust and active.   The question is whether such a question of the status of these philosophies is itself philosophical. A philosophy can die, or appear to die. Or live, or appear to live. Does that have to do with what is in the philosophy? Or is it ""political"", as they say, pertaining to trends, support, finances, approbation or disapprobation? Is that something worth thinking about? And how does one go about such thinking, aside from from asking for pointers on reddit?  Philosophy may talk about life and death, among other things. A good deal of analytic philosophy doesn't broach such topics. Others might. In *The Ends of Man* (I think), Derrida begins by making something of the idea that ""philosophy died"" recently, that its death has been announced more than once. Nietzsche said that gods, too, can die.   There was a commercial years ago in which Madge, the beautician, was doing the nails of a customer, while talking about Palmolive® dish detergent, all while her customer, with whom she is talking has her hand in a bowl of soap to soften her nails.

t5_2qioo,Deitjh,1375373951,"Do you have any ""enhancements"" turned on? if so maybe disable them try the game then turn on immediate mode and try again.  Edit: just reading about this problem now. This is where the stereo mix is         Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound      ♠ Sound &gt; Manage audio devices      ♠ Right-click in the clear space beneath your devices &gt; Show Disabled Devices      ♠ Right-click on Stereo Mix &gt; Enable  Apparently the game aint super compatable with win7 or 8. Oddly adding -dx9 instead of no sound works for alot of people but then ya loose some of the dx10 effects but meh. . Another Edit: :P To fix the sound problem in Bioshock 1 under Windows 7, all you need to do is to ENABLE ""Stereo Mix"" in the Sound   Settings of Windows 7.   Step-by-Step Solution:  1. Access your system Sound Recording Settings In your status bar, right-click on the sound/speaker and select ""Recording devices"". OR (Alternatively, access the setting by click on Windows ""Start Menu"" &gt; ""Control Panel"" &gt; ""Hardware and Sound"" &gt; click on link ""Manage audio devices"" under section ""Sound"" &gt; click on the tab named ""Recording"" )  Screenshot: http://www.vietvodao.co.za/images/ex...-StereoMix.png  2. Enable Stereo Mix (see screenshot) Right click in the list of ""recording device"" where you should see ""Microphone"", ""Line in"", maybe ""CD Audio"". In the context menu, Tick the line called ""Show Disabled Devices"". Now you should seed ""Stereo Mix"" as a new Device. Right click on Stereo Mix and click on the first option of the context menu ""Enable"".  3. Disable Microphone, LineIn, CD*Audio There was an echo / reverb effect going on in the game which wasn't related to the in-game Reverb setting (OFF). I think the windows recording settings created a feedback loop, so I disabled Microphone, LineIn and CD Audio and voilà! Problem was gone.   This is it, Bioshock should work. You can also take the time to review the options in ""Stereo Mix Properties"", for example I set Default Format to   2 channel, 16bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality) in the advanced tab, just enforce quality.  Description of the Problem: Once a game is loaded, there is no sound at all in Bioshock 1. When I start Bioshock 1 under Windows 7, I can ear the background music in the main game menu, but there's no ""on click"" sound effect when clicking on the menu entries. That's a sign that the sound will not work after loading a game, not point wasting further time.   Summary of things that didn't work for me: Using compatibility mode ( 2000, XP SP2 or SP3) does not work ( game freezes at menu) Installing Rapture3D drivers doesn't change anything Reinstalling latest sound drivers or using Win7 native drivers is not necessary Pluging-in earphones or microphone into the linein/mike inputs didn't work for me  Hope this post will save you time to enjoy the game.  ogui",♠

t5_2ri0h,Kichigai,1375375246,"Learn to improve your composition and framing. Learn the [rule of thirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds). Generally your videographer will take care of this, but if you're your own videographer, this will be key. And even if you're not, there will be times when they'll goof and you'll have to fix it, or you'll have to start inserting graphics, or something like that. Whitespace is your friend.  ---  Remember: **Less is more**. When it comes to compositing things into your shot, or creating graphics, you want things to be simpler. The more stuff you add to a shot, the more distracting it all becomes. This goes double for special effects and filters. The simplest effects are often the best: a slight soft focus, or a touch of color correction. Stay away from extremes.  ---  Lossy compression is a Bad Thing™. Repeat after me: **lossy video compression is a Bad Thing™**. Got it? Good! I don't see it happening in professional environments, but all too often in /r/videoediting I hear people complaining that their source footage is too big and they want to squash it down to like 4MbPS H.264 or something like that, and I can universally say that this *will* reduce the quality of your video significantly. Each time you recompress your footage you experience [generational loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss). When you go to *very* lossy compression formats like H.264, and you throw the bitrate way down you lose a *lot* of detail and color resolution, which means that effects won't look as good, your colors won't look as good, and when you end up throwing the video on YouTube or whatever it'll have gone through two or three more rounds of recompression and won't even resemble the quality of the original.  There's also the problem with Int*ra*frame Compression versus Int*er*frame Compression. Most ""consumer"" formats, like typical H.264 or MPEG-2, are interframe compressed, using I, P and B frames. This means when your I frame comes up, the following P and B frames depend on it for visual information, usually as high as 15 successive frames. This makes editing more difficult because your software needs to take that into account, and if it doesn't (or your file gets damaged) you'll end up with garbage. [This page](http://www.videoclarity.com/WPUnderstandingJNDDMOSPSNR.html) has a pretty good explanation, just skip on down to the ""Types of Errors"" section and it will explain those problems better. In contrast, intraframe compression is a compression type where each frame is handled independently, and does not depend on surrounding frames for visual information. This means easier editing and less chance of quality loss due to errors.  Now, technically, almost all formats are lossy, but there are some really high quality codecs you can use that have almost imperceptible quality loss, and these include ProRes 422/ProRes 422 HQ (ProRes 422 LT has noticeable quality loss) and DNxHD 145/220/175. JPEG-2000 is also very high quality, but because it's so computationally intensive I don't recommend using it for editing. The only reason I'd ever go more compressed than that is if we were doing an online/offline editing workflow, which most people don't do. I also wouldn't use anything lower quality than ProRes, DNxHD or J2K for an archival codec. Low bitrate H.264 gives me the heebiejeebies.  This goes for music and images as well. Avoid JPG and MP3/AAC audio whenever possible.  ---  **NEVER THROW AWAY YOUR SOURCE FOOTAGE!** So many time people take their stuff in and ingest it, and manipulate it, and then something happens and they want to know how to fix it. If you keep all your raw material from straight out the camera somewhere, you'll always have somewhere to go back to. In some edit systems, in some workflows you can lose *all* your work footage, all your renders, everything you've done, gone, but be able to regenerate most of your material just by pointing your editor to the raw footage and telling it to reingest it.",™

t5_2qi67,carrboneous,1375383491,"As a Religious Jew™ on this subreddit, I feel I must speak up here. (And obviously, I can only speak for myself, but I do suspect I'm not alone).  First, I'll make an admission or two: I am probably ignorant of how extreme things can be, and how frequent such incidents occur. I also feel, in certain cases, an emotional attachment to elements of the Jewish world that I don't agree with or condone that makes me loath to hurl criticism upon them, even when I think they're wrong.  *However*, neither is because I secretly agree, want to cover up, am afraid of how it will reflect on me, or anything like that. And nor is it because I don't wish I could change it. The reality is (a) I generally dislike ugly news, and have no real interest in hearing about horrible things, and (b) I honestly don't identify with that sector of society at all, and I naturally deny that they are common not because of medacious intent to sweep under the rug, because it is so insanely abhorrent and unacceptable, that I can't believe it is common (like many other serious crimes and perversions that I can't really wrap my head around).  I don't see any reason so speak up, because I don't feel that these guys are in any way my people. We're both Jewish, of course, we both claim and aim to be following halocha, but this is off the wall. No one I respect would even consider condoning such disgusting behaviour, even if any of them did agree with the premise that men and women should be involuntarily segregated.  It's like asking me why I don't condemn the violence in Syria every day. It's not that I think it's ok, it's just that it is way out of my world, and there's only time for so much condemnation in a day (and, more realistically, only so much one person can worry about).  You mention that we/I would more likely condemn WoW than these guys, but that's not inconsistent. These guys are so far outside of any legitimate view that it really doesn't cross my mind that anyone would think they represent me or Torah. For exactly the same reason, I don't feel any need to speak out against Jews who believe it is totally fine to eat octopus, or to molest children, or to drive to shul on Shabbas, or preaching atheism or anti-Torah beliefs. It is obvious that there is no (Torah) justification for any of these things.  However, when there is a more subtle perversion, whether it be claiming that it is ok to steal from the government to fund religious institutions, suggesting that straightforward apikorsus is consistent with the Rishonim, or that the Western Wall is a legitimate political tool, I will speak up. Just like you wouldn't condemn Robery Mugabe's election rigging and general abuse of the people he is supposed to serve, but you might be very angry about Obama using drones or collecting your information, you just don't care about the one of whom you expect no better, and you care very much about even the minor infractions of the one close to you.  I said that I feel emotionally close to certain groups even though I disagree strongly with them. That does not apply to these ... animals. I honestly think the only solution is to have people bigger than them who will physically [take them outside and show them what it's like](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61iZXRCAL6s). There is no reason we should stand for this, and if they're too diffuse for the justice system to take care of, while I oppose vigilantism, I think we should do what is necessary to protect the private property and the safety of the public. I would have no problem with marshals of some sort keeping the peace.  But yeah, I don't feel the need to protest every time someone in black and white throws a rock, because honestly, it is so far from anything that I stand for that it is offensive I would be considered in the same category or that it would be considered my business. (Even if they *were* behaving unacceptably about principles I agree with (in principle), which is *not* the case).  PS I also don't think that my saying anything, or the gedolim saying anything, or the legal system, or literally anything less than physical and immediate deterrence will do anything to stop it. Which is another reason that ""speaking up"" seems pointless.",™

t5_2s4k5,SaneBRZ,1375385585,"Normally I would suggest laptop like the Lenovo ThinkPad T430 or Dell Latitude E6430, but compared to other laptops they are outdated and you could get something better. The refresh of these 14 inch business grade laptops will hapen in mid September or early October and I don't know if you can wait so long.  So, if you can live with a 15.6 inch laptop my first suggestion would be a [Dell Latitude E6540](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e6540-laptop/pd):  * 15.6 inch, 1080p display * Intel i7-4800MQ + 8 GB of RAM (up to 16 GB) * 500 GB HDD + 24 GB SSD cache * AMD Radeon HD 8790M (Open CL 1.2 support) * 9 cell battery (6-8 hours of battery life) * Intel® 6235 2X2 802.11n + Bluetooth 4.0 + WiDi * 3 Year Basic Hardware Service with 3 Year NBD Limited Onsite Service After Remote Diagnosis * Price: $1479  As a cheaper alternative you could take a look at the [Asus N550JV-DB71](http://www.xoticpc.com/asus-n550jvdb71-eta-midaugust-p-6115.html):  * 15.6 inch, 1080p display * Intel i7-4700MQ + 8 GB of RAM * 1 TB HDD * Nvidia GT750M * 4 cell battery (around 4 hours of battery life) * ASUS 1-year Limited Global Hardware Warranty + Accidental Damage Protection * Price: around 1000 bucks  The advantages of the Dell are the better battery life, the warranty and service, and better user accessible parts. The Asus is about 500 bucks cheaper but has only a one year warranty and an internal battery.  Edit: I forgot another laptop you could take a look at, the [Samsung Ativ Book 6](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-15-6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-Mineral/dp/B00B588J6S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375385691&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ativ+book+6):  * 15.6 inch, 1080p touchscreen * Intel i7-3635QM + 8 GB of RAM * 1 TB HDD * AMD Radeon HD 8770M * Price: $1200  It doesn't have a Haswell CPU like the other two, but it still gets decent battery life, despite the quad core Ivy Bridge CPU.",®

The 13.5 oz. Red Line Selvage denim is 100% cotton, woven in Greensboro, North Carolina at Cone Denim® Mills. They are cut and sewn in Kentucky in a factory that has been operating since 1891. Our vintage inspired western fit jean has been rinsed once to soften the jean and reduce shrinkage. Designed with a slight kick in the front pockets for easy accessibility and a slight opening at the ankle to fit comfortably over your boot. Each pair of jeans has been painstakingly constructed by America's most skilled denim craftsmen to create an honest pair of jeans. Custom 1791 &amp; Co. copper washer and aluminum burr rivet are used on all points of strain on the jeans. The denim fibers that are pushed up through the washer are a mark of authenticity. The suede leather patch on the back of our jeans have all been personally hand branded with the 1791 logo. &gt; &gt;•Handset chain-stitched waistband with reinforced tacking on the belt loops for durability.  &gt;• Exposed selvage coin pocket. An authentic and unique detail that makes it a 1791 jean.  &gt;•Golden-yellow stitching (Straight-Leg Signature Thread)  &gt;•Five-pocket jean with hidden copper/aluminum rivets on the back jean pockets  &gt;•Custom 1791 &amp; Co.

Cover mechanic? ✔  Over the top cinematic scenes? ✔  Big guns and even bigger explosions? ✔  Characters with shallow personalities who only exist to fulfill their cliche action movie roles? ✔  Vulnerable lead character who is put into a situation where he/she must overcome their vulnerabilities but in reality flips a switch about an hour into the game and only gets more violent and more 'manly' as the game progresses(E.G Farcry 3 syndrome)? ✔  Simplified upgrade system that is meant to make the game scale in difficulty but in reality only makes the game easier? ✔,✔

t5_2rnve,khrawn,1375404016,"I can see your Motherboard supports DDR2 only, getting these new will be hard. I'm afraid getting ram, you will need to buy used.  It seems i am mistaken. Sorry. In order to use an Athlon, you will indeed need a new motherboard. However, if you can find a Phenom II x6, then it can fit into your motherboard. However, i doubt you can find one new, and like your ram, it will most likely have to be bought used.  It really is a tough spot, especially since most of it is outdated.   I'm tempted to say that you shouldn't get a better gpu than a 650 maybe ti version, or 7770. Since, your cpu is going to be the first thing bottlenecking, before the gpu.  Looking at the motherboard cpu support:  ""Support for Socket AM3/ AM2+/ AM2 processors: AMD Phenom™ FX processor/ AMD Phenom™ X4 processor/ AMD Phenom™ X3 processor/ AMD Athlon™ X2 processor/ AMD Athlon™ processor/ AMD Sempron™ X2 processor/ AMD Sempron™ processor""  So, you can actually throw in a phenom 965 II x4, if you can find one, on newegg this was the only phenom quad core i could find:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103894  It cost a bit more, but it's most likely to handle a 7850, maybe a 7870 before it becomes a bottleneck. So, even a 660 is going to be fine.  HOWEVER:  ""(Note) If you install AMD AM3/ AM2+ CPU on AM2 motherboard, the system bus speed will downgrade from HT3.0 (5200MT/s) to HT1.0 (2000 MT/s) spec; however, the frequency of AM3/ AM2+ CPU will not be impacted. Please refer ""CPU Support List"" for more information.""  I would only think that it is because the motherboard is so old, it does not support the newer speeds, of the cpu's, so, well, most likely the cpu isn't going to perform as well as with a newer board, but it'll work.

t5_2rfxx,LullabyGaming,1375413302,"On Annie you **always** auto attack people. She's got a massive range of 625 so she can easily harass people. Also since I go utility I have the added incentive to auto attack due to pickpocket.  If you want to go 21/9/0 just go with standard burst caster items *(DFG, Rab, Lich)* but this was directed toward tanky top lane Annie.  9/21/0 isn't that good either since most of the points you get from it just flat out end up being wasted. Even though you're going tanky, you won't get that much health or armor/MR for the % buffs to affect you and since you're at a long range with a stun and the wonderful free stats from E, the auto attack damage reduction isn't necessary either. Utility offers a lot of MS, free gold and CDR, all stats that Annie can use extremely well.  For you going Ignite might be better. I myself have played some couple of hundred Annie games during the ~2 years I've played this game and I've learned my damage potential pretty well. I find kills without Ignite so I've not felt the need to pick it for a long time now. I just love the splitpush potential on Annie because towards the later parts of the game W will oneshot waves and Annie can pretty much 1v1 anyone with the tanky build.  I also love how much of an effect TP has on the game earlier on in the game. I often get Homeguard on Annie very early in to the game *(Like Wraith -&gt; Guise -&gt; Homeguard early)* because I love to roam to bottom from the top lane with my ult, having homeguard helps with that A LOT since you don't take so much time doing it.  TP with homeguard is just godlike so ward placement doesn't really matter.  I'm not a high elo player either so wards aren't perfect where I play at either. I've found though that if I tell them ""My TP is up in X, place a ward here"" and ping on the map, quite often the support places a ward there.  And even if they don't, you can just TP to creeps and run with homeguard. Easy kills. ♥",♥

Also, depending on when you're coming down (like maybe next weekend) they might be having an event and may not be open. I'd recommend skipping Magic Hat. Lost Nation in Morrisville is a great newcomer, and Rock Art in Morrisville is a good established player; both en-route to Hill Farmstead. The Alchemist in Waterbury is wonderful if you like IPAs and can get there when they have Heady in stock; if you're in Waterbury and looking for food+drinks, head over to Prohibtion Pig, Blackback Pub  or the Reservoir, all within a couple hundred meters, all with exceptional tap handles and great food. The Beverage Warehouse in Winooski is the best place to stock up; Pearl Street Beverage in Burlington has a good selection as well. If you're interested in heading further south, Otter Creek and Long Trail are so-so.  Bobcat Cafe in Bristol is recommended.  Mule Bar in Winooski is recommended.  In Burlington itself, check out Farmhouse Tap and Grill for the best beer bar around, and great food too. American Flatbread / Zero Gravity is a both a solid brewery and the flatbread's great, too; these two places are about a two minute walk apart, with the Vermont Pub and Brewery in the middle, which is well worth stopping at as well.

t5_2qt1p,lorkpoin,1375418451,"Hm. Then I don't recommend either of these swords. They are a half-step up from wall-hangers. It is quite possible that the tang (where all cheap swords skimp on metal because it isn't visible) will break and send the blade flying away from the handle mid-cut. And having a giant sword become a giant, razor-sharp unguided missile in the midst of your friends is a Bad Thing™. I've seen it happen. I've seen the blood.  I'd still recommend a longsword rather than a zweihander/spadone/montante/claymore for what you're intending. Control is more important to looking good than size. If you *must* have something oversized, then don't fuck around with cheap, dangerous swords: try [this](http://www.albion-swords.com/swords/albion/nextgen/sword-medieval-danish-2-hander.htm) or [this](http://www.albion-swords.com/swords/albion/nextgen/sword-landesknecht-tyrolean.htm) or [this](http://www.by-the-sword.com/p-2340-german-landsknecht-sword-bts-h012.aspx) or [this](http://www.by-the-sword.com/p-2341-two-hand-sword-bts-h013.aspx). It's not clear to me if the last two are actually made by Arms &amp; Armor, but at least they probably won't come apart at the seams with the light use you're describing.  Lastly, remember that a sword doesn't actually have any power: the wielder either understands his art or he doesn't. I've seen people unable to cut a water bottle with a razor-sharp longsword from a full shoulder cut, and I've seen a skilled swordsman cut through a large, tough watermelon with a unsharpened olympic saber using only a wrist cut. Personal proficiency and control are much more important than any attribute of a particular blade.",™

Burroughs ©  The ancient Egyptians postulated seven souls.  Top soul, and the first to leave at the moment of death, is Ren, the Secret Name. This corresponds to my Director. He directs the film of your life from conception to death. The Secret Name is the title of your film. When you die, that's where Ren came in.  Second soul, and second one off the sinking ship, is Sekem: Energy, Power, Light. The Director gives the orders, Sekem presses the right buttons.  Number three is Khu, the Guardian Angel. He, she, or it is third man out ... depicted as flying away across a full moon, a bird with luminous wings and head of light. Sort of thing you might see on a screen in an Indian restaurant in Panama. The Khu is responsible for the subject and can be injured in his defense-but not permanently, since the first three souls are eternal. They go back to Heaven for another vessel. The four remaining souls must take their chances with the subject in the Land of the Dead.  Number four is Ba, the Heart, often treacherous. This is a hawk's body with your face on it, shrunk down to the size of a fist. Many a hero has been brought down, like Samson, by a perfidious Ba.  Number five is Ka, the Double, most closely associated with the subject.

t5_2qqjc,Purple10tacle,1375429184,"We like to complain a lot, that's just German nature.  But in reality it sucks a whole lot less than the US system - but that's frankly not really a hard goal to achieve for any democracy.  It's fundamentally more democratic, stable and less corrupt. That's not saying that Germany has managed to keep money and lobbies out of politics entirely, that's far from the case. But the political system makes it a lot harder for both to gain too much influence.  Compromises are necessary and common (Germany's two biggest parties even governed together in the past and are likely to do it again). New parties are given a chance and since WWII at least two new parties have gained sufficient traction to influence federal politics (and several more on a state level).  It may not be paradise, but, yes, it is magnitudes more democratic than the money driven, gridlocked two party system of the greatest and freest and best country in the world™.  But, again, that's not a difficult feat to achieve and doesn't make Germany special in any way on a global scale. Germany had the big advantage of having to redesign its basic democratic system nearly from scratch 70 years ago while learning from its own mistakes and those of others alike. ",™

t5_2sew3,cefor,1375454068,"Actually, the best method as put forward by many self-publishing authors is to Write Good Books™, and write more of them.  Setting a book at $.99 makes more sense than setting it at $2.99 and giving people who buy the book $13. At least with a book at $.99 you're making 35% off each purchase rather than -325%.  Yes, spend money to make money, sure... But in the case of self publishing, you spend money on the cover and the editing, you don't *pay* people to buy your book, what's the point in that?  If you have $500 dollars to waste on bribing people to buy your book you should write a second and third book and get commissioned covers for them. That's way more effective.  What's more, monetary success won't happen overnight and trying to force it won't make it happen any sooner. Sure, getting 40+ sales is good, but unless you keep it at 40+ sales every day you're going nowhere. The way Amazon's lists work in particular, you have to rely on consistent sales, not one-off surges.  And, I'm sorry to repeat myself, but instead of paying people to buy your book you can just promo it for free. They don't pay anything and you don't pay anything. It'd work just the same. You can't shortcut this. You need to put work in somewhere to get results.  Also, even if you didn't buy reviews, and you still went ahead with giving money away, if the book isn't good enough on its own merits to warrant reviews then those initial reviews would do nothing for you in the long run except show your book to be unfairly pushed higher arbitrarily. You'd be doing your readers a disservice. A lot of people rely on the number of reviews a book has to gauge whether they'll buy a book or not.  So, to sum up: Write Good Books™, and write more of them. Plus, build a list and a funnel. Once someone's read your book, does the last page have information on where the reader can go next? Your next novel, your homepage, your Twitter/Facebook/Other Social Media? If not, you're doing it wrong.",™

She looked to his eyes and she suddenly knew that her love for him was forever through.   She gazed at the captain, out, steering above. It was only for him that her heart gave out love.   When Mc Hagerty noticed her look, he felt pain. ""I must get her loving me well once again!""   He challenged the captain to a sword's duel. The winner the maiden's loving would rule.   Ah, but the captain with the sword was a man! With one sweeping slash knocked the sword from his hand.   McHagerty's hope  was thoroughly gone. The captain ordered him murdered at dawn.   The night passed quite quickly. The sun cast its rays. Yes, Thomas McHagerty would die today.   ""Do I have one request before I die?"" He looked at the captain who then said, ""Aye.""    He lifted his hand to wave goodbye, and slugged his true love in the eye.   by Denise Rodgers Copyright© Denise Rodgers  All Rights Reserved",©

t5_2qh1i,FayeKane,1375484093,"==-- *In high school, I thought I would always think sex was ""animalistic"" and shameful.*  To me, it was **obvious**.  I even plastered signs all over the halls saying so.  I was really just afraid of boys (mortally terrified actually, and I kind of still am), but I didn't realize it.  I announced that when ""the outer space people"" come down, that they'll only see ME as worthy of living with them in a sterile world where nobody has sex, nobody has feelings, and nobody has to die.  I would have been a _sucker_ for that cult that cut off their balls and then killed themselves to be with a comet.  The crazy ""outer space people"" shit died literally 3 seconds after my first hit of dope at college.  It was one of two religious-like revelatuions in my life. But I still remained terribly, pathologically, cripplingly shy after college and even as a nuc engineer.  I always hated my body for being the kind that attracts men like flies"", which is how I thought of it until 2002. I also hated being Real Smart which, other than knowing what the stars are and why the sun shines, isn't worth a god damn thing.  Yeah, to ME, knowing astrophysics made it all worthwhile, but passing guys in the halls at work was still hugely traumatic even though I stared straight ahead and never said anything. I mean, they have DICKS, right? That knowledge was very, very disorienting.  When they spoke to me, even just to be nice, I literally panicked.  Everyone knew not to talk to ""the crazy autistic chick"".  Just leave her alone and let her write the hard parts of the skyshine reactor shielding software.  *It wasn't until being raped in a stranger's basement in 2002 that I realized what I really am: _a female animal, who's ONLY purpose for existing is to be fucked_*, and then fall over and die so I won't compete with what the men implanted inside me in their sexual anger.  And most of all, THAT I LIKE IT.   I like all of it, including falling over dead after a lifetime of rape. Death makes life **sexy**.    That weekend was the other ""religious revelation,"" and though the torture hurt, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.   Women's libber Gloria Steinham said, ""All sex is rape.""  She was right, but she talked about it like it was a BAD thing!    The reason married people are bored with sex is because it isn't rape anymore.  It becomes just some kind of **medical problem** about things like contraceptive devices.  When pussy eating turns into breast feeding, the enthusiasm inside you gets suppressed and buried.  Sex is supposed to be what it was when you were 16.  Mysterious, exciting, magic, and WONDERFUL!  I'm autistic and I still find even the slightest emotional intimacy terminally embarrassing. I'll never look anyone in the eyes when I'm talking, no matter what, _period._   To me, ""love"" is just an unnecessary intellectual excuse for delicious rape. ""Love"" is only to placate the newly-evolved frontal brain, which is horrified at what sex really is (just like I was in high school).   You're not supposed to think about sex, you're supposed to DO it.  But  I'm cursed by God (or the black monolith, or whatever) to think about **everything,** always.  I am still crippled, though.  First it was with fear of sex, now it's with regret because of all the sexy stuff I COULD have done in college.  Oh well.  Anyway, being psychotically afraid of sex like in high school is what I thought I would always be part of me forever.  BTW, I've written more about this, if you want to google me.  faye kane ♀ homeless brain sexiest astrophysicist you'll ever see naked  ",♀
t5_2qmlu,djtonyb,1375484251,"Official response via writing from Christian Berkey at Johnson Creek...  Most studies regarding synthetic nicotine were conducted in the 60's and 70's by tobacco companies looking for a way to add nicotine on the manufacturing level instead of on the agricultural or botany level. Purely synthetic nicotine is made with a combination of Niacin, Ethanol, Sulfuric Acid and a few other nasty chemicals. When adjusted for inflation, the cost of the process is prohibitively expensive when compared to modern extraction methods. Additionally, we've never seen research indicating a feasible pharmaceutical grade product - industrial grades only. While modern technology may allow for additional resolution steps, we believe the cost has kept it from being seriously pursued. That combination of high cost and more importantly low quality makes it a presently unacceptable option for Johnson Creek.   While additional research may have been done, we've never seen published works stating so. To our knowledge, there is currently no firm offering a synthetic pharmaceutical grade nicotine.    Extracted nicotine, regardless of plant origin, processed to pharma grades, is technically not synthetic. This pharma or ""pure"" nicotine is used in our products. Other pharma forms of nicotine, such as nicotine polacrilex, undergo a similar process but undergo specific bonding for use in products like nicotine gum, etc.""  Please let me know if there is additional information I can provide. Please also feel free to post this.  Kind Regards,  Christian Berkey Chairman &amp; CEO Johnson Creek® Enterprises, Inc. ",®

[SBS 1](http://i.imgur.com/Y0IMQNy.jpg)  **Q:** Is it possible to make [Kakigōri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakig%C5%8Dri) out of Aokiji?  -P.N. (Pen-name) Baka-Inu  **ODA:** Yes, it's possible. He's ice, after all. But, eating it might be a different story. He might return to Aokiji in your stomach and take control of you.  **Q:** When my father, who loves Shiro-hige, comes home drunk every night and gets scolded by mother he responds ""How could drinking something you love be bad for your body? Gurarararara"" But, the next morning he's on his knees bowing down to my mother. How can my father be cooler? -P.N. Biro and Akke  **ODA:** Hmmm, it was going well for him up to a certain point, but the next morning is pretty disgraceful. How about your mother also becomes Shiro-hige and says ""I will love my husband, even though he is an idiot."" and forgives him?  (*Translator Note - The two panels on the right are referencing the scenes where Shirohige says the quotes*)  **Q:** Oftentimes, my cat will suddenly jump on my lap and it is very cute. My father (Age 59) also oftentimes will suddenly place his head on my mother's lap and want her to [clean his ears](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%80%B3%E6%8E%BB%E3%81%8D) but is disliked for this. What beckons these two to [using peoples' laps as pillows?](http://www.getafilms.com/geta/data/h/Hizamakura/imgs/ph_Hizamakura_002.jpg) -P.N. Ne(sleeping)co Robin  **ODA:** It's kind of sad that these questions at the expense of fathers are continuing on like this. Well, I guess using peoples' laps as a pillow has it's own appeal. It's the same calling that beckons the mountain climber to the mountain.     [SBS 2](http://i.imgur.com/gbuVdYC.jpg) (*Translator Note: This is actually the first SBS in this volume*)  **ODA:** Hey everyone! I'd like to give an energetic welcome in this volume too - ""LET'S BEGIN SBS~~~~!!""  **Reader:** Fix that. It's SBS*-sann*  -P.N. Kimurinn  **ODA:** Oh!! S..sorry... Let's begin... SBS-sann...   **Q:** Question. Odacchi, I have a question. Since when in his life did Franky become a pervert?  And is the new Shichibukai this guy? ➡ (*TN: Points to drawn image next to the question.*)    -P.N. Arabiki Sausage  **ODA:** Um, no?? Oh, and Franky was a pervert since his previous life.  **Q:** Odacchi, I found him!!! It was unexpectedly easy. I'm telling you, it's that guy - that guy [Candre](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Candre) (Kanndore)! (*TN: Referencing panel on the right*) Volume 57, page 108, panel 3, second from the left. It has to be! If it's wrong, then there's something wrong with your head, Odacchi. Right? it has to be!    -P.N. Teagwecheikei  **ODA:** Yup, there he is. Last volume I asked whoever was bored to find this guy, Candre (Kanndore). That's him.   **Q:** Hello! This is regarding the twin brothers ""Andre (Anndore) and Candre (Kanndore)"" mentioned in the volume 70 SBS. Is this referencing [Inoue Yousui-sann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dsui_Inoue) from around his debut over 40 years ago. His hair was [also an afro](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/36746693.jpg) at around that time too.    -P.N. Mukashi ha Gitaa Kozou (I used to be a guitar-kid)  **ODA:** Yep, that's it. Although I got the name from that, I actually know nothing about ""Andre・Candre"". I just know that name from television. You must know it because you're 56 years old, right? By the way, the reason I gave him the name Andre is because I thought he looked like the pro-wrestler called [Andre the Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_the_Giant). Yeah... there wasn't much thought behind it (lol).   [SBS3](http://i.imgur.com/sZOYzLz.jpg)  **Q:** Regarding chapter 700... Oops...! Good evening, Odacchi! Regarding chapter 700, while Luffy and gang are on the way to Dress~~rossa~~rouba, we can see animals that look like sea rabbits. What does Law like to eat other than [Onigiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri)?    -P.N. Hasumomo  **ODA:** Well, ummm, [grilled fish](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E9%AD%9A)! Alright, next question.  **Q:** Question. Robin always says frightening things in front of everyone. But in her own thoughts, she oftentimes thinks of fun stuff like ""Cats"" or ""Dress-rouba"" (*T.N. - Panels of Robin's thoughts to the right of question. Also, Dress-rouba is a pun on Dressrossa, meaning ""Dress-Old Woman*). Why doesn't Robin talk about these thoughts with her crew to make them laugh? I love how Robin is like this.   -P.N. Y.O  **ODA:** I see, that's true. From what I think - based on during the Punk Hazard arc when she told Franky (in Chopper's body) not to ever make such a strange face in Chopper's body again - Robin probably likes cute things. But even though she likes cute things, she's a bit dark/creepy herself, so if she tries to put these cute thoughts to words there is a chance it may come out as scary/ominous. That's the kind of woman that Robin is.  **Q:** This might be out of nowhere, but who in the Strawhate Pirates can use Haki? It's bothering me and I can't activate my ""Love Hurricane"".  **ODA:** It's these three. Their specialty haki color is in the parentheses. (*TN: Picture of Luffy (Hao-shoku Haki), Zoro (Buso-shoku Haki), Sannji (Kennbunn-shoku Haki)* )    [SBS 4](http://i.imgur.com/9AIykDi.jpg)  **Q:** In chapter 701, Law claimed that one of his crew drew the map that he shared. Is that crew member referring to Bepo!!? I ask this because at the bottom right of the map you can see a blurred paw print. It's there, right?  -P.N. TakaAki・T  **ODA:** Yes, it's there, of course. Bepo is the Navigator of the Heart Pirates after all. He drew that map.  **Q:** Odacchi! In volume 70, chapter 700, Sannji made onigiri for Law, who doesn't like bread. What was inside those onigiri?    -P.N. Natsuki  **ODA:** Well, the first onigiri had [Tuna-mayonnaise](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/cvs_onigiri/imgs/1/f/1f8f0198.jpg) inside. The second [onigiri](http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_mall/nihonshokken/cabinet/00043413/img11500399.jpg) had [okaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi) inside. And the [last onigiri](http://justbento.com/files/bento/images/onigiri7_innie.jpg) had super sour [umeboshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeboshi) inside. By the way, Law hates umeboshi. A few minutes later, he and Sannji got into an argument because of that.  **Q:** What's the name of Law's sword? How many tattoos does Law-sann have? Odacchi... please draw all of Law's tattoos!  **ODA:** Ok, got it! Here are the drawing of Laws tattoos taken from my notes (*TN: Reference drawings to right of question*). He has heart themed tattoos, but I wonder if there is a reason for that? The name of his sword is Kikoku (*TN: Written as 鬼哭 meaning ""Demon's Cry""*), it is a 'cursed Sword' (*TN: Written as 妖刀, read as ""Yo To"", translating to something along the lines of ""bewitched"" ""sword""*)   [SBS 5](http://i.imgur.com/on0GgMv.jpg)  **Q:** Odacchi, did you eat toilet paper this morning?  **ODA:** Ah!!! There was toilet paper around my mouth, sorry about that. (*TN: Vergo reference*)  **Q:** I thought of birthdays for Caesar and Monet! Caesar is April 9th and Monet is August 27th! Is that ok? (*TN: Refer to raw - it's a pun. 4月 is April. 9日 is Ninth. ４月９日 can be read as ""Shinokuni"" using Japanese onnyomi. Same with Monet. With a bit of effort ８月２７日 can be read as ""Harpy Day"".*)  **ODA:** Yeah, sure. ほじほじ (*TN: ほじほじ is an Onomatopoeia for picking your nose. Probably used in this case to signify that he could care less.*)  **Q:** In chapter 700 there is a reporter named ""Abusa"", that's referring to Absalom right? Right? And if you look closely, there's even the pirate ship. What other kinds of eroti... amazing articles... What other kinds of eroti... I mean, moving articles... What other kinds of erotic articles does he write?  **ODA:** Yes, that is Absalom. How nostalgic. In fact, he was also at the Battle of Marineford. After the battle, Doflamingo stated that something strange happened to Moria. I wonder why? Perona is also worried. Did Moria really die? The only thing that I can reveal right now is Absalom, going by the name ""Abusa"", has become has been reporting a lot of big news using his ""SukeSuke no Mi"" - this is true. He can take many interesting photographs with that ability. His articles are very popular right now.  Alright, with that I'm ending the EROBS. See you next volume!!   ",➡

t5_2qj8f,saijanai,1375518357,"&gt;&gt;Again, more animals per group would have made the original Seralini study far more robust and none of your listed criticisms appear to be relevant. &gt; When, with no other relevant evaluation, you put pics of tumor ridden rats into a data-based report in order to elicit an emotional ""shock"" response from the reviewer that is absolutely relevant.  I doubt the reviewers were shocked. This was a PR stunt for *readers* of the article, specifically laymen and the press.   &gt;&gt; Hundreds of carcinoma studies use SD rats. There are 7 2-year carcinoma studies that use SD rats. Monsanto's 90-day studies all use SD rats. Monsanto even published a 52 week study using SD rats.  &gt; Can you show that the studies were NOT studies done to merely evaluate tumor growth and not specific cause?  Er, preliminary studies of this type are done just to see if cancers occur or not.  &gt;&gt; Er, both experimental groups and control groups in the Seralini study DID use the same number of test animals.  &gt;&gt; Where do you get that? They had ONE control group to cover all the other experimental groups. Eight other sets of variables. A control group for each experimental group is the norm.  Not really. In fact, the EFSA 408 guidelines say:  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/search/doc/2438.pdf  &gt;For the testing of chemicals, OECD 408 specifies the use of 80 animals comprising both sexes in four treatment groups (control, low, medium and high dose).   Now, the guidelines are somewhat different for GMOs, but that is because they assume a mixture of different foods.  Seralini's study used one feed type: maize, in all their groups. THey just used different proportions of the ~~bt~~ RoundUp Ready® and near-isogenic strains.  &gt;&lt;The location of each cage within the experimental room was regularly moved. This 2 year life-long experiment was conducted in a GPL environment according to OECD guidelines. After 20 days of acclimatization, 100 male and 100 female animals were randomly assigned on a weight basis into 10 equivalent groups. For each sex, one control group had access to plain water and standard diet from the closest isogenic non-transgenic maize control; six groups were fed with 11, 22 and 33% of GM NK603 maize either treated or not with R. The final three groups were fed with the control diet and had access to water supplemented with respectively 1.1 × 10−8% of R (0.1 ppb of R or 50 ng/L of glyphosate, the contaminating level of some regular tap waters), 0.09% of R (400 mg/kg, US MRL of glyphosate in some GM feed) and 0.5% of R (2.25 g/L, half of the minimal agricultural working dilution). This was changed weekly. Twice weekly monitoring allowed careful observation and palpation of animals, recording of clinical signs, measurement of any tumors that may arise, food and water consumption, and individual body weights.  A better design would be to use a much larger control group, but that's for statistical power issues. Monsanto's own studies carefully use multiple small groups, the same size as the experimental groups, which coincidentally helps keep statistical power low...  ...funny coincidence, that.",®

t5_2qkeh,Joshme,1375523037,"&gt; 1.) Is the price on the window sticker the total price you pay?  No. There are always additional fees associated with a dealership. They range from complete BS to total BS. When I bought my last two cars I told them I don't deal in car price, I deal in overall price. I told them ""This is what I am going to pay to leave with your car. Not a dime more."" &gt; 2.) I'm currently looking at a Ford Focus and a 6-speed PowerShift™ automatic transmission is one of the options. How does this differ from a normal automatic?  This is vastly different from a regular transmission. With out getting too technical, it is basically better. It is a new transmission, so it is bound to have issues pop up eventually and we just don't know the complete abilities of it yet. With that said, I would love for my car to have it.   &gt; 3.) What is the best car you can get for under $20,000?  This is a matter of opinion. I'm a Ford guy. Someone else might like Chevy's more. Are you looking for a tiny car or a big car? What do you need to do with it. This is stuff you need to think about.   &gt; 4.) What is available incentives? Is that like a sale or something? It says -$2,500  This is basically trying to con you into buying a brand new car. While there are sometimes reasons to get a new car and these incentives help choose one brand over another, don't base your decision on these. If a dealership has an asking price of $16K, you should not be paying $16K for it. This is where the ""haggling"" comes into play.  &gt; 5.) If I tell them to paint a car, is the paint the same quality as factory painted cars?  Don't. Go with what colors are there. Painting is expensive.   &gt; 6.) If the colors available on the website the only one I can paint it with? Can I tell them to paint it blue if the website has no blue option?  See above. Any of the ""add on""s and any changes start to jack the price up. Look at it this way: You buy the car and they paint it. Now you're paying for the car, the paint, the labor for them to paint it and the dealerships premium for the hassle of getting your car painted.   Find a used car lot. Stay out of big cities (usually because the money in the city allows the dealerships to raise prices). Settle for what you need, not what you ""want"". Do you need that big v-6? Or will the 4 cylinder do you just fine? I made the mistake of buying too much car and I paid heavily for it. Also, pay as much as you can out of pocket. Try to not finance it. If you do finance ask if there is an early pay off fee. Pay every two weeks instead of once a month; if your payment is $150 a month, pay $75 twice a month (by the due date).   Good luck.   Oh! When you go, bring a friend. Bring your parents. Bring someone; that way you have backup. If you don't like something about the dealer or the salesman or the car or the price, leave. There are plenty of dealerships and you do not need to deal with any BS from them. They want your business and the moment you threaten to leave, they will try and fix the problem. Accept no sass; take no mercy. ",™

I went on the hen do of one of my closest friends - she gets married in 6 days, eeek!  My parents left for a holiday to Canada, meaning I've been in charge of all housework etc... and it's been a nightmare, because I've had to tidy up after my brother and he is a seriously messy shit .__. They're back tomorrow!  I met up with another one of my best friends for the first time since she came out of the Big Brother house! Went into town with her and it was ridiculous, she was getting recognised everywhere, right little celebrity! Mental haha!  Many birthdays were had... And in turn many celebrations!  Now I'm looking forward to seeing my fella again in 4 days and the wedding in 6! ♥  Gone Too Long!  Thanks for the contest :3",♥

t5_2qh16,darkstar3333,1375552939,"&gt; With what? Windows or OS X? Either way, you're wrong. Upgrading Windows and OS X both does not require a clean install. Not even in the original commenters situation.  Microsoft officially stated otherwise, XP to W7 required a clean install and it was the recommended approach with Vista.  * Upgrades to Windows 7 from the following operating systems are not supported:  * Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows XP, Windows Vista® RTM, Windows Vista Starter, Windows 7 M3, Windows 7 Beta, Windows 7 RC, or Windows 7 IDS  Source: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772579%28v=ws.10%29.aspx  &gt; That's because your previous activation is still in affect. If you upgraded to Win8 from a Win7 laptop wasn't activated... it won't just magically become activated.  Actually it would be, there is no key de-activation that takes place. You can also re-use that license by installing it and activating it on another machine. That upgrade keys is treated as a retail key and not bound to the hardware like OEM keys are. You simply cannot have 2 machines running the same key (which is fair).  &gt; Great. Apple used to sell family packs of OS X for cheaper too.  They generally also require multiple pieces of supported hardware, which in itself hides the OS cost. Frankly you should be entitled to software updates for the life of your hardware considering the premium.",®

t5_2tx47,bridget1989,1375558113,"My silver lining is.... my dogs and my friends.  I know I've been ""whining"" in most of the contests I've been entered about my unemployment status, but it's kind of dominating my life right now. I worked for one year out of college at a corporate office, and I was eventually laid off for lack of work. It was hard on me, because I really did love my job, but it turned out to be a sort of (very mild sort of) blessing.  I have been able to step back for a while and examine my life and what I really want, and I realized that working in corporate America was really bringing me down. I'm not a money-hungry person; I'm a big-hearted individual who should be using my whole big heart in my job.  So I've been on my local non-profit jobs website searching for the perfec local non-profit to work for. A lot of the positions require skills I don't have (social worker, nurse), but I've had a first and a second interview at a really awesome nonprofit that I'm hoping will call me back next week and say, ""You're hired!""  I'm so glad I have my IRL friends, and you all, to keep me cheery and lend me a fiver for some frozen yogurt. I'm so glad I have the two coolest dogs in the entire universe so I stay sane and have somewhere to work off my extra energy (five mile walks! Beach dates! My dogs LOVE that I'm unemployed!)  Good luck to all of you in both life and the contest. =) ♥",♥

Here's a list of funds I can invest in, expense ratios. I couldn't find the ticker symbol for the funds. But I added a description of the fund from the page.  1. Equity Fund - Exp Ratio: .03%   Description:Seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P 500® Index. 2. Growth Fund - Exp Ratio: .022%   Description:Seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000® Growth Index. Large-growth stocks are generally made up of big companies (in terms of market value) that may grow faster than other large-capitalization stocks. 3. Growth Fund - Exp Ratio: .022%   Description:Seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000® Value Index. Large-value stocks are generally made up of big companies (in terms of market value) with lower than average price-to-earnings ratios and which may grow more slowly than other large-capitalization stocks.  4. Midcap Fund - Exp Ratio: .022%   Description:A domestic equity investment option. Seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P MidCap 400® Index. 5. Smallcap Fund - Exp Ratio: .032%   Description:Primarily invests in stocks that make up the Russell 2000® Index. The fund may make limited use of futures and/or options for the purpose of maintaining equity exposure.  6. Balanced Fund - Exp Ratio: .026%   Description:Investing approximately 60% of assets in stocks and other equity securities and the remainder in bonds and other debt securities, including lower-quality debt securities, when its outlook is neutral. Investing at least 25% of total assets in fixed-income senior securities (including debt securities and preferred stock). Engaging in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund. 7. Bond Fund - Exp Ratio: .0245%   Description:The fund will invest in high quality securities, including U.S. Treasury, federal agency, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and corporate securities. In the past, this investment has shown a relatively small range of price fluctuations compared to many other investments.   Again thanks for all the help! I really appreciate it. ",®

t5_2w2s8,aufleur,1375564106,"Early on in life I just knew I was a girl, I knew I was different. So yah, I knew I had always been that way. It just took me years to finally accept myself and realize that I'm not alone.  As far as hurdles, I think my life has turned out to be a very big lesson of acceptance and love. I grew up in a *very* homophobic household and my family had no qualms about using very insulting slurs. As a result I hated myself and was very afraid that I felt I was a girl, so I never spoke of it. I internalized my feelings and grew up depressed. This has been the biggest social and emotional hurdle of my life. Coming out and going through transition resulted in me being disowned by most of my family including my parents.   Coming out also taught me to love myself and love those around me *for who they are* and honestly my transition so far has turned out beautiful. I'm very privileged to be accepted by my job and friends and others.  It's been great. The most liberating experience of my life.  ""Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose""  I'm living life ♥ Thanks for the questions.  **tl;dr -- yes, I've always felt female. Coming out and self acceptance has been my biggest social hurdle.**",♥

VVGG   I'm sure many are just ""GG-ing"" because they think it's funny, just like VVGN if someone does something stupid. The problem is though, that it plants pretty damn toxic seeds that lead to people getting fed up, leading to people mashing F6 every 5 seconds because ""It's too soon to start another surrender vote."", leading to people actually agreeing to the surrender because ""I have better things to do/You're feeding/Hopeless/My wrist hurts"" and generally being im-fucking-patient when it's not immediately obvious that you're going to win.   A big chunk of the community play full games, and I think you're having a bit of bad luck, but I know what it feels like to get constantly thrown into games with the seemingly most pessimistic people you could ever imagine.   I personally have resignated a bit when it comes to surrendering. I only vote when it makes sense, i. e. we lost a team fight at FG and it's only a matter of time until the game inevitably ends. If it's a 10-Minute-Surrender™ I don't vote at all. They're either all for it without me being the one pressing F7, and maybe changing someones mind by doing so, or they aren't.

Source  Division of Research, Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, California, United States of America ; Department of Health Research and Policy, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America. Abstract  Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a potential endocrine disruptor impacting metabolic processes and increasing the risk of obesity. To determine whether urine BPA level is associated with overweight/obesity in school-age children, we examined 1,326 students in grades 4-12 from three schools (one elementary, one middle, and one high school) in Shanghai. More than 98% of eligible students participated. Total urine BPA concentration was measured and anthropometric measures were taken by trained research staff. Information on risk factors for childhood obesity was collected for potential confounders. Age- and gender-specific weight greater than 90(th) percentile of the underlying population was the outcome measure. After adjustment for potential confounders, a higher urine BPA level (≥2 µg/L), at the level corresponding to the median urine BPA level in the U.S. population, was associated with more than two-fold increased risk of having weight &gt;90(th) percentile among girls aged 9-12 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.15-4.65). The association showed a dose-response relationship with increasing urine BPA level associated with further increased risk of overweight (p = 0.006 for trend test). Other anthropometric measures of obesity showed similar results. The same association was not observed among boys. This gender difference of BPA effect was consistent with findings from experimental studies and previous epidemiological studies. Our study suggests that BPA could be a potential new environmental obesogen. Widespread exposure to BPA in the human population may also be contributing to the worldwide obesity epidemic.

t5_2wo26,idioma,1375639250,"&gt; And what are those benefits? I don't consider war and poverty to be ""benefits"".  Edgy.  &gt; Which are of poor quality, far too expensive, and take far too long to build  Okay, John Galt, why don't you go find some undeveloped land outside of the United States and just show the rest of the world how easy it is to build infrastructure? You can assume all of the costs and risks, and then own the results. Godspeed.  &gt; Which are filled with violence, poor food, and anything but education  Says the kid who almost certainly attended a public school, where he learned how to write a self-defeating, yet correctly spelled argument.  &gt; Who take 30 minutes to respond to a crime scene and take 3 days to a catch a terrorist on the loose, and more often than not, are corrupt  Maybe you could put on a cape and mask and go fight crime yourself. You seem to think it isn't that hard to do anyways, so why not show the rest of us how to get it done. Kickass!  &gt;&gt; maintained by city workers  &gt; No?  Oh, I'm sorry, do you take care of all of the landscaping at your local parks? Do you collect the garbage and maintain the sewers where you live? Are you responsible for making sure that the streetlights work and that streets are clearly marked? Unless you are living on the set of Robocop, chances are pretty good that other people are taking care of that stuff.  &gt; Which right off the bat causes it to be worthless  Yeah, you are right, no one accepts dollars as payment anymore. It is pretty sad, actually. All of those billionaires are just sitting on worthless piles of green paper with no one willing to exchange them for goods or services. Hey there sport, how'd you barter for your computer and internet?  &gt; But the air isn't clean, and the water isn't safe. All the regulation does is codify and protect the poisoning.  I suppose you can just pull up on your bootstraps and supply yourself then. No one forces you to drink municipal tap water, and you are certainly free to visit beautiful, breezy Somalia whenever you'd like a fresh breath of air--which has yet to be tainted by the government's jackbooted thugs.  &gt; They do, and have. It's because of private industry, and the like of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, hat[sic] you're even on this site right now.  You are so right! It isn't as though the government had anything to do with creating the internet, right? Certainly Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never used any government resources on their way to success. They just pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and the free market did the rest! How could I forget that?  &gt; It is because of private industry, that you can get an apple at any time of the year at any time.  The private industry™ moves their goods across a private interstate highway system that they built by themselves, I suppose? Of course, they can always  use the private railways that never received any government handouts as well. The government never played any roll at all in facilitating any of that.  &gt; It is because of private industry that you can fly around the world in a matter of hours.  Especially since the government never invested in aviation or aerospace technology, they never protected any patents, and never protected any of the assets of airlines. I'm sure that there was never any publicly funded research into basic sciences which enabled greater precision for machining or design either. The private sector did it all!  &gt; FAFSA loans are much more costly than any private backed student loan would be, and education costs are actually high because of the government, and that's why people borrow money form their parents.  So tell me Mr. Captain of Industry: What do you do for a living? What's your own tax burden look like? Are you a net-contributor or just another embarrassed looter who's looking for someone else to blame for your lack of productivity? I'll make it rain up votes if you can offer even a shred of intellectual honesty for that last part. ",™

t5_2qh6c,heb0,1375642429,"If you find yourself stumbling so much, you should probably look into a pair of shoes with better ankle support or less slick soles. Personally, I would recommend a pair with some sort of rigid motion control structure toward the rear of the shoe. I found that, whenever I invested in the New Balance 1226 with ROLLBAR™ technology, frequent ankle sprains brought on by overpronation of my left foot became a thing of the past.   Also, simple changes can make a major difference in the sureness of your footing. Make sure your pair of shoes fit both in length and width. Tying your shoes each time when putting them on instead of slipping your foot into an already-tied shoe can also prevent many foot and ankle injuries. And be sure to tie your shoes tightly but not so tight that circulation in your feet is restricted.  In short, the message here is *pull your own damn self up by your bootstraps*. It's not anyone else's job to pick out your shoes and tie them for you. You're all adults. You should've learned to dress yourselves years ago. As long as you aren't sticking your foot out and tripping your neighbor, it's not your fault if they're wearing thong sandals in the rain or high heels to a hiking expedition. ",™

t5_2fwo,moor-GAYZ,1375647730,"&gt; Back when you had impoverished resources on a single core architecture, a language like C++ or Java allowed making the best use of these resources. Today, architectures are predominantly multicore and clusters. Single core performance is no longer interesting.  Except for the part where you literally pay for your CPU time, then you suddenly care about raw performance again.   &gt; Java fails miserably at this task because of its reliance on mutable share state.  This might surprise you, but scalable Java code has not been relying on mutable shared state [for 15 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans). Functional programming is not discovering America here, it has been well understood for a long time that it's nice to have most of your logic in relatively small stateless components that can be spawned as necessary and migrated between nodes.  However it's really unclear that one should strive to implement the components themselves without mutable state at the cost of performance.   And of course currently and in any foreseeable future there would not exist a Sufficiently Clever Compiler™ that could take your homogeneously-functional program and parallelize it. Erlang programmers design their programs to be parallel, to consist of mostly independent units each of which should run on a single core, just like programmers writing parallel code in any other language/framework.",™

We will not ship any single package containing over ONE OZ of product, larger orders must be placed separately.)   ===== REFUNDS =====  You buy at your own risk, we will not issue refunds or reships on lost packages.

t5_2fwo,yogthos,1375657471,"&gt;Except for the part where you literally pay for your CPU time, then you suddenly care about raw performance again.  There's always going to niches where raw performance matters. Today, this certainly isn't the general case.  &gt;This might surprise you, but scalable Java code has not been relying on mutable shared state for 15 years.   And many people realize by now just how woefully inadequate Java is for this task.  &gt;However it's really unclear that one should strive to implement the components themselves without mutable state at the cost of performance.  If you care about performance that much you should be switching off Java to Haskell ASAP as it runs circles around it.  By using Java, a hosted language, you already accept the truth that raw performance alone is not single most important consideration. Developer time, correctness, and maintainability often trump it.  What's important is scalability, and the functional approach facilitates it naturally.  &gt;And of course currently and in any foreseeable future there would not exist a Sufficiently Clever Compiler™ that could take your homogeneously-functional program and parallelize it.  There's no need for compiler to parallelize it. You can decide the granularity yourself. However, it's much easier for you to parallelize your functional code since it's all inherently stateless.   &gt;Erlang programmers design their programs to be parallel, to consist of mostly independent units each of which should run on a single core, just like programmers writing parallel code in any other language/framework.  It might be news to you, but Erlang VM runs each individual function as an independent process. Clustering is actually handled at VM level in Erlang. This means that the same code that runs on a single core runs on a cluster and in parallel.  ",™

t5_2qoox,plewis32a,1375657743,"Check out your metabolic type as it relates to insomnia; http://www.metabolictyping.info/_insom1.html In certain Metabolic Type®s (parasympathetics or fast oxidizers) there is usually a requirement to eat before going to bed. If these types don't eat, they usually will experience difficulty falling asleep, and if they do fall asleep they will invariably awaken in the middle of the night. Usually, their ideal fuel mixture is a snack that contains a good amount of protein and fat. A high carbohydrate snack may help some, but is usually not sufficient to carry them through the night. In these Metabolic Type®s, a high carbohydrate snack will actually be stimulating (by increasing the oxidation rate) and thus, prevent sleep. Other Metabolic Type®s (sympathetics and slow oxidizers) generally don't do well eating before bed.

t5_2sg7u,Solmundr,1375665058,"Thanks for taking the time to address each bit so thoroughly. I'm never disappointed by a TheBattler™ post!  &gt;They really excel at all stages of the game, especially Feudal Age. Cheaper Skirms and Spears, free Town Watch, and 20% stronger buildings (although I'm not counting armor, this is as much as Masonry and Architecture but in the Feudal Age) makes the Byzantines the best anti-Flush civ and allows them to do pretty much whatever they want. They're very strong there.  That's news to me, but it makes sense. I always thought they were versatile late-game, but I totally forgot, or never knew, about the skirmish/spearman bonus... which is almost like an economic bonus, really. I almost always end up making some. (My new theory: scout + skirmisher = super combo. I've yet to try it out, though.)  &gt;The Spanish don't do well on water maps at all. They have no good bonus for it. The Cannon Galleon bonus comes way too late in the game and tons of other civs can win the water but this thread is about land civs, anyway.  Also news to me, but I should have seen it coming. When I play Islands, it's usually Team Islands, and at a low level... so we often end up in the late Imperial Age before heavy engagement, and the super cannon galleons seemed like they'd be really good, en masse. I've never actually seen it, because even at my level a Viking player (me :D) has often taken control of the water before elite cannon galleons can be massed, but I thought in principle, maybe... nah.  &gt;They're pretty good the other half but they aren't great. They get the best UU in the Castle Age but they have to build a Castle first. In the meantime they can't build XBows, which is a big deal.  It's weird to me that Spanish don't get crossbows! I forgot about that, too. This is the problem I thought the Mayans might have, though; you're right in that Huns are easier, which is an incentive to play them, but I thought the other reason they were better than Mayans was their cavalry archers. I thought perhaps the Mayans might be able to simulate CA performance with their plumes, but then they need a castle... maybe not a problem in the late game where massed HCAs are likely...? Or maybe they're not as good as I thought they were.  &gt;The Aztecs have a strong economic bonus that helps them early game. [...] They're weak during the Castle Age because they lack Knights but they are unstoppable early Imp thanks to the Eagle Warriors.   The bonus forces more micro in drop-offs, was my thinking, so I sort've dismissed it -- but I guess if you have the micro, and once you're past the early game, it is quite a good bonus. Don't Mayans have better Eagles, though?  &gt;They're actually not particularly strong at Flushing. Faster Archery Ranges is nice but doesn't really make much of a difference for the Feudal Age. They do reach the Feudal Age faster than alot of civs. Longbowmen are great but they only come into play later in the game. For much of the Castle Age, the Britons do okay and the extra range on XBows makes up for Thumb Ring but doesn't outdo it.  &gt;I think they're smack dab middle of the pack.  No... my beloved Britons! Nah, I expected you had some solid reasons for Briton placement. The only thing a little surprising to me is the importance of Thumb Ring; I thought their extra range more than made up for it, although it's a bit weird that they don't have it (I suppose for balance). But then, I think the extra range gets better on an Elite Longbowman, and that's pretty late-game.  (Now, Britons vs Vikings... go! I pick Britons for campy maps where I think I can mass longbowmen, but otherwise I tend to pick Vikings, because people expect infantry and not archers and I like their economy. I don't tend to use Goths much any more, because I felt they wouldn't be good at flushing, but I might be wrong.)",™

t5_2qhnf,buku55,1375673303,"The SGI is a Destructive Cult by Definition  1). Destructive cults actively recruit new members, often through deceptive “front” organizations.  The SGI has the Boston Research Center, the Institute for Oriental Philosophy, Human Rights Education Research association, 7/11 [hehe] and others where their affiliation to SGI is rarely if ever mentioned.  2).Destructive cults claim to offer absolute Truth. Their teachings are not (to them) mere theory or speculation. The most effective cult doctrines are those which are unverifiable and unevaluable.  The SGI claims that their believers are the only Nichiren Lotus Sutra believerscapable of obtaining Buddhahood, going so far to claim that all SGI members are Buddhas while those of the Nichiren Shu and Kempon Hokke, for example, are “deluded Shakyamuni worshippers”.  3).Destructive cults reduce everything to a bi-polar attitude: “for us, or against us.”  Anyone who criticizes the SGI, no matter how wise, is a fool and anyone who praises the SGI,no matter how foolish, is wise. Daisaku Ikeda writes, for example:  “Seven years have passed since then. The outcome of the struggle of good and evil and the workings of the law of cause and effect have been strict and uncompromising. The decline of the crazed and destructive Nichiren Shoshu is clearly apparent. The victims, unfortunately, are the la ybelievers who practice with the temple, who are not aware of Nichiren Shoshu’s evil and have been deceived by the priests.”  4).Destructive cults generate some kind of external “pet devil” with which to threatentheir members if they should doubt, or fail, or ever leave the group.  The SGI has dozens of  “pet devils”. Those who leave will have misfortune on their jobs, in their families, in the social lives,have accidents, fall into hell, etc. President Toda stated: “If you keep this up, you’re going to cometo a pitiful end in life.” and “Betraying the Soka Gakkai is betraying the Daishonin. In the end, they’ll receive the punishment of the Buddha, you’ll see.” Ikeda says, “To take action to fight against whatever forces appear as the enemies of the Soka Gakkai is our most noble mission.” Matilda Buck says, “How tragic it would be for even one person to have found the great means of bringing forthBuddhahood only to be diverted to another, seemingly similar, path that is incapable of leading thatindividual to his or her deepest happiness.” This is the jist of the Gakkai’s attempt to chain themembers to the Gakkai way of life. The Biggest ”pet devil” is Nikken of the Nichiren Shoshu:  “When Buddhism speaks of “devilish functions,” what does that really mean? These represent whatever tries to prevent us from advancing in our Buddhist practice. In a sense, they are frightened when we expand the Buddha?s forces, because the realm they want to control will the nbe changed into a pure land. In our case right now, this function is being manifested in the currenthigh priest of Nichiren Shoshu.”  5).Destructive cults lead their members to believe they are somehow superior to all other humans on the earth.  In many of Daisaku Ikeda’s speeches we see how the SGI members are to view themselves:  “Sons of the Gakkai”, “Inheritors of Myoho”, “Lions of the Mystic Law”, “The sole group of true believers”, “Truly praiseworthy are you who resolve to work hard for kosen-rufu and the SGI. You are the most noble of all people.”  6).Destructive cults put the will of the group above the will of the individual. This is often reinforced with simplistic games or rituals of some type designed to make the individual subservient to the group.  If you search, you will find such quotes from the eternal Soka Gakkai mentor, “the Soka Gakkai is more important than my life.” We also see the special Soka Gakkai holidays like May 3rd, day of mentor and disciple, and such slogans as, “reaffirming the prime point of the Soka Gakkai”  We see inordinate references to Soka Gakkai, SGI, and Ikeda in nearly every experience given by an SGI member. There used to be dress and hair (short) and beard(none) codes for the SGI Young Men’s Division and on saturdays everyone had to dress in whitepants and white tee-shirts.7).  7).Destructive cults teach that the end justifies the means.  How they misuse upaya (expedient means) is a travesty. Flirtatious shakabuku by young women’s division, telling peoplethey can get new cars and even drugs if the chant, teaching people that they will immediatelybecome Buddhas if they join the SGI, and the list goes on and on how they utilize the ends justifythe means philosophy of Machiavelli, the antithesis of the Buddha’s teachings.  8).Destructive cults teach strict obedience to superiors and encourage the developmentof behavior patterns that are similar to those of the leader.  Is there any doubt why the SokaGakkai is known throughout the ten directions as the Ikeda cult? Guidance division, never criticizing leaders, “follow no matter what”, this is so apparent to everyone but the brainwashed SGI memberhimself. Lately, the SGI has abandoned any subtle pretense with such overt youth division guidelinesas, “  Reveal your true identity as Shinichi Yamamoto” and “I want to be ShinichiYamamoto”  9).Destructive cults offer acceptance by the group for good performance, and conversely,withhold it for poor performance.  Moving up the ladder from Jr Group Chief, to Group Chief, toDistrict Chief, to Chapter Chief, to Area Chief, to Territory Chief, to Joint Territory Chief and so on.Busting people from their position or moving them at the leaders will.  10).In destructive cults, fear is a major motivator. Guilt is a close second, and shame isthird. Only the cult leader is perfect, so everyone below is fearful that those above willfind out their shortcomings. Cult members feel constantly guilty for having those real or imagined shortcomings, and are ashamed that they haven’t worked harder to get rid of them.  “Never talk about your problems to the members until they are resolved.” “Did you know that so and so got hit by a car and is paralyzed. He should have stayed with the Soka Gakkai.” “She turned in her SGI Gohonzon and lost her job and her house.” “He committed suicide not soon after joining the Nikken sect.”  11).Destructive cult members swing from emotional highs, to emotional lows regularly. Lows are not long tolerated, and result in more indoctrination, or even ejection from the group if they last too long.  Here are some examples of SGI speech used to control their members: “You have weak faith.”. ‘You had better go for guidance if you want to resolve that problem”. Rumors to stay away from depressed individuals. Not inviting less than enthusiastic members to certain meetings or not telling them about “important” meetings. Lectures about “emotionalism”, [unless the emotion is rapture about the SGI and the mentor]. Every last former SGI cult member will attest to this.  12).Destructive cults tend to re-write their members’ past, manipulate their present, and distort their future. Disrupting time orientation is an honored technique of all such cults.  Human Revolution, New Human Revolution, New New Human Revolution. Need I say more?  13).And, finally, there is never a legitimate reason for leaving a destructive cult. The only reason members leave a perfect system, is because they are imperfect in some respect and will be punished for it.  “He was angry.” “He was jealous.” ""He couldn’t get along with his leader.” “He had weak faith.”  (even if ""he"" continues to chant three hours a day and does shakabuku with the Nichiren Shu or the Kempon Hokke). “No matter which destructive cult you choose, the above 13 items will almost universally apply"".  The author of these 13 points [whose name escapes me] then goes on to conclude: Study the methods of est, LaRouche, Transcendental Meditation, Truth Station, Soka Gakkai, TheWay International, Children of God, Temple of Set, Synanon, Scientology ®, The Peoples Temple, Unification Church, Hare Krishnas, House of Judah, Ramtha, Garbage Eaters, Rajneesh, ECK, ChurchUniversal and Triumphant, Elan Vital, Posse Comitatus, or any of the others…. they use the same techniques, even though each of them claims unique and absolute ownership of the “truth.” ",®

t5_2qwis,magicmuffintheft,1375674985,"I got something similar almost happened to me today. I was away the whole day, but left my pc on, and when I came back, I had a chat invite from a user that was in one of my friend's group. So I accepted it to see if  it was recent and was maybe an invite to CSGO or TF2. When the chat window opened, the user was offline but I saw the message me left:  &gt;Sunday, August 04, 2013  &gt;Mr.Popo: Steam™ will give you 1 game to add to your ""game library"" or ""inventory"". Just visit and complete simple steps in - www steamjump gegahost net  **&lt;-- DONT EVEN FUCKING GO TO THIS WEBSITE!**  &gt;Mr.Popo is currently offline, they will receive your message the next time they log in.    Well in my eyes, it looked like the most generic phishing message ever. But i looked up the URL on google and ran into this thread on the steam fourms: http://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/1/864975249566606764/  The exact same message. I checked out the website in incognito mode and it asked for an email account, email password, and steam password. Obvious phishing scam, so I go to his profile to report him and see that his account is 4 years old, he has 50+ games and that his inventory is almost drained. So its more than likely that he was a victim of the scam and has become a spam bot.  Or, you know, he's the scammer and just sold off his plunder  **TL;DR:** Don't click links that offer ""free"" games.",™

t5_2s4k5,cheungster,1375694440,"currently responding to this on my w350st (7352).  Owned it for about a week.  Friend owns the y510. Heres some feedback.  The build quality is solid.  backlight isnt necessary although looks really cool on the y510.  I upgraded to the 95% gamut screen since i do photo editing and the screen is amazing.  It has more than enough power to do what you need.  However, with that said Im debating returning it.  First, the keyboard layout is odd to type on.  Its set off to the left a little bit to make room for the numkeys, and it just feels awkward with everything shifted.  My right palm brushes over the touchpad which is annoying. Also, when I lean my wrist over the edge of the bottom of the laptop, it kind of digs into my skin.  The touch pad isnt the greatest either.  Battery life isnt great but thats to be expected on a machine this powerful.  Lastly, the speakers are ATROCIOUS.  there is absolutely no bass, and the volume is exceptionally low.  the speakers on my galaxy s3 are miles ahead of the ones on here.  To top it off, on the laptop itself, there are two stickers which boast ""Speakers insalled: ONKYO"" and another saying ""Sound blaster cinema"" which isnt even installed in the system if i recall - its just a generic driver.  There is no option to choose a better speaker setup through customization.  If you do go with this system, I highly recommend using powernotebooks.com.  Their customer service was phenomenal.  I initially ordered my computer at like 1am and at like 3am i got a reply from a live agent wanting to confirm some details.  The laptop was on backorder for awhile and he (Donald) kept me informed every step of the way.  Heres my full specs if you're interested.

t5_2qh1i,Kushiels_Handmaiden,1375699953,"Part 2 of 2:  &gt; *Being gay excludes people from procreating by its definition*  Not always. Due to the intense pressure on both men and women (although men feel it more keenly due to enduring stereotypes about what it is to “be a man”) to appear “normal”, many gay people supress their natural desires and get straight-married and even produce children, before coming out later in life. This has the potential to be a destructive force in the family – not because the dad or mum is “suddenly gay”, because they have always been gay, just supressing it. It’s destructive because these people did not have the freedom to be who they were naturally in the first place; they *feared* the reactions of the people around them. It is the attitudes towards gay people announcing their identity that is the destructive force here. In order to make a stable home life for the children involved, it is critical that we educate our children (and a hell of a lot of our adults as well) that hiding your true nature, when there is nothing wrong with you, is not something they should ever feel the need to do.   &gt; *My religion taught me / I grew up being taught that marriage is “one man, one woman”, so that’s why I’m against gay marriage.*   Great! And I wouldn’t for the world tell you that you must believe otherwise. But your beliefs should not inform public policy when those beliefs are naturally exclusionary to a well-established subculture such as homosexual people and relationships.   Also, all beliefs, religious or otherwise, are open to being questioned. When you were a teenager I bet you started to question your parents’ authority, once you learned that it was not absolute. You were brought up to believe something – that’s fine. But your beliefs are open to being questioned and examined, by you and by others.   &gt; *Why aren’t the gays happy with Civil Partnership? Why take the name “marriage” at all?*   This was addressed most eloquently by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who said that as marriage vs civil partnership currently stands in America (and has stood in the UK too), the fact that (in this case under DOMA) there is such a vast gap between the benefits that straight-married couples get as opposed to same-sex couples, that you have two types of marriage: “the full marriage, and this sort of skim milk marriage”. It promotes the idea of “separate but equal”. If we are equal as humans, we have the right to share in the definition of a time-honoured and fundamental human institution, regardless of sexuality or sexual identity.   &gt; *I oppose gay rights because I don’t like gay people.*   Cool. Again, you have the right to believe it, but not the right to enforce it as law. The law must treat all equally, or it’s not the law; it’s an extensive list of privileges granted to a select few.   &gt; *Being gay is a choice, so it’s not covered by “gay rights”*   When did you choose to be straight?   &gt; *The “slippery slope” argument: if we allow gays to marry, why not allow people to marry their dogs, or children. ARE YOU WITH THE DOG-RAPERS / PEDOS?*  Marriage is between two consenting adults. Therefore animals cannot consent, and neither can children (same as the age of consent – before this age children are deemed insufficiently mature enough to actively consent to sex/marriage/etc). It’s also creating a false dichotomy of “you’re either for marriage as man-woman, or you’re with the pedos”. Another strawman, and a terribly dangerous one at that. It’s the same argument that governments use to restrict filesharing: you’re either a law-abiding citizen or a Terrible Internet Pitate ™. Put it into any other context and it’s abundantly clear how silly this one is.   Like I said, I'm all for the freedom to hold whatever religious or social beliefs you deem appropriate. But using those beliefs to restrict the rights of others that you yourself enjoy is something I find to be deeply ethically wrong.   If you've read all the way down to here - thank you for your time :)  **EDITS** Formatting. Is there a ""preview"" function on Reddit that I'm missing? ",™

t5_2svuj,electrophile91,1375704333,"No, it depends...  &gt;The study used standard NIDA cannabis with 4% THC content. A quantitative analysis found that the Volcano® delivered 46% of the THC into vapor following three 45-second exposures of the sample to the heat. This compares favorably with the typical efficiency of marijuana cigarettes as observed in other studies, which depending on conditions can fall below 25% due to loss of THC in sidestream smoke. An important feature of the Volcano® is that it uses a balloon to capture the vapor, thereby avoiding leakage to the air. It is possible that higher THC efficiencies could have been reached with the Volcano® by stirring the sample around and exposing it to more heat. The combusted sample achieved a relatively high THC efficiency of 78% upon complete combustion. The high efficiency seems due to the fact that the sample was completely consumed by combustion, and that smoke leakage was effectively prevented by the laboratory setup. Similar conditions do not obtain under normal circumstances when a marijuana cigarette is smoked and much of the THC is lost to the air or left in the unburned ""roach.""  http://www.canorml.org/healthfacts/Second-Study-Shows-Vaporizers-Drastically-Reduce-Toxins-in-Marijuana-Smoke   tl;dr vaping is competitively effective compared with various different smoking techniques, it probably is less efficient than using a pipe or bong, but more efficient than a joint, although in the case of vaping, the remaining 'ABV' still contains the unused cannabinoids and can be eaten, re-vaped or smoked.",®

t5_2cneq,clavalle,1375719167,"I can tell you how it will happen.  ☑ A bunch of Republican Governors will refuse to implement the insurance exchanges  ☑ So the Federal Government will do it for them  ☑ Insurance companies will be on these Federally created exchanges that cover all of these uncooperative States. (This is important because there will be less fragmentation in the exchanges set up by the Feds).  ☑ Businesses, especially those that have low paid workers, will pay fees rather than offer insurance to their employees or get their employees to work less than 30 hours/wk.  ☐ These employees will pick the cheap insurance from these exchanges.  ☐ One or two of the companies will start to run away with a huge number of enrollees because of the way insurance works.  They have more enrollees, so risk is spread, so they can offer lower rates so they will get more enrollees etc.  ☐ After a few years between one and three companies will come out as winners after this process plays out.  ☐ The Federal Government will bless one or more of these winners as the Federal Option.  ☐ The virtuous cycle accelerates.  Other insurance companies begin to die or are merged.  ☐ Once one of these companies reaches critical mass and becomes the de facto Public Option, the government will begin to get more and more involved until it is a quasi public institution or fully absorbed into the government.  ☐ At this point it becomes The Single Payer.  All other players might still exist but are pushed into small niches.  ",☑

Hopefully, I can hold out until I get my first payday (I have a sports bra that's a lousy fit but comfortable enough). The stores I live by are lousy. In my local Dillard's which is the only department store in my mall that sells bras bigger a D cup, the only size near to what you've suggested that I've ever found was a 34G. Needless to say that the back rode up and it gave me quadruple-boob with a side of armpit fat. Haha. I can't really see a 32H being better since don't they have the same cup volume, or whatever?

t5_2qhv7,pewdro,1375727294,"&gt; En esos tiempos era tan devota que iba a misa de 9:30 am a las 8:40 para poder prepararme y participar bien.  Mi mamá desde que tengo uso de razón ha sido medio anti-iglesia (y tiene sus razones), y a mi papá como que nunca ha tenido convicción de ir, por eso yo crecí alejado de la iglesia.  Que recuerde, en toda mi infancia y adolescencia, solamente fui con mis papás una o dos veces a misa que no fueran XV, bautizos o bodas.  &gt; No le veo nada malo, siempre y cuando los niños se den cuenta que hay otras realidades. Curiosamente, un libro de los testigos me mostró cuando tenía 8 años que habían otras religiones, lo cual me puso a pensar **""¿Quien tiene la razón?""**  Jajajaja, a mi también me pasó lo mismo, yo como desde los 10 años leía mucho Despertad y la Atalaya, venían los versículos y todo, era como mi escape a todas las dudas espirituales que tenía.  Me hizo más crítico, venía mucho lo de adoración a los ídolos e imágenes, que yo decía que porqué los adoraban en las iglesias, lo del agua bendita, los rosarios, ostias, supersticiones y todas esas cosas.  Pero, a mi punto de vista te pintaban a un Dios furioso, esperando que hicieras cualquier cosa mala para condenarte en el lago de fuego.  &gt; Ya a los 14-15, me dí cuenta que estan idiotas todos, pero lo importante es fomentar el pensamiento crítico en todos los ambitos.  Yo lo que quería era encontrar *la religión verdadera*, es decir, lo que predicaban los primeros apóstoles, lo que verdaderamente enseñaba Jesús, algo natural y auténtico, que no tuviera ritos, vestimentas raras, hipocresía, etc.  No la encontré, y fue por eso que llegué a pensar que Dios no existía.  Tiempo después, aprendí que la religión verdadera no existe, que en todas vas a encontrar cosas buenas y malas, y desgraciadamente en la muchas mas malas que buenas.  Me di cuenta que la Biblia, sobre todo el NT está cargado de una forma de vida completamente renovada y de que te dice como vivir.  Y nunca me explicaron nada, absolutamente nada del evangelio en las iglesias que estuve anteriormente, como que te dan migajas de Dios, y ellos se creen los super santos y con la autoridad de decirte que esta bien, o que está mal.   Dice la Biblia, que Jesús vino a acabar con todas las instituciones religiosas creadas por el hombre, con todos los hipócritas como él los llamó, de que se creían literalmente tocados por Dios.   Que vino a quitar el velo que separaba a la humanidad de Dios, y que pasó después, que estaba ganando adeptos que creyeron en él, y que las mismas instituciones religiosas que lo asesinaron se lo adjuntaron y crearon el Jesús™  Dice la Biblia, que no se necesita de un hombre o de un lugar para estar en comunión con Dios, que cualquiera lo puede estar solamente con la ayuda de Jesús.   &gt;Si no, vamos a terminar siguiendo circlejerks en todas partes : /  Aquí aplicaría el meme del capitán obvio, que dice, que si uno piensa que un hombre aquí tiene tooda la razón, va a pasar un muy mal rato.",™

t5_2t7no,pretendcontender,1375756051,"I'm glad that you understand my doubts. I want to clarify my point. I don't shop at Whole Foods (often). I'm not vehemently GMO because it's clearly a stupid catch all term. All foods are modified. I recognize that. You talk about how controlling the variables will make lab-grown meat ""perfect."" When I compare industrial farming to more holistic management practices, the nutritional content of the food is better. The animals are healthier (I've worked on factory farms and visited holistically managed farms and the differences were astounding). Industrial farming, which exerts more control over the inputs and environment of the meat, hasn't yielded much other than consistent product. Understanding how a whole ecosystem effects the quality of our food and how our own internal biomes interact with food is something that science hasn't cracked yet. It's why a person eating a balanced diet is going to be healthier than a person consuming the same amount of calories (through ""junk"" foods) and vitamins (from pills). It's a complex process how we interact with food and how our food interacts with it's environment. I understand what you are saying about people that think everything that is more ""natural"" is better and not realizing that there are millions of people alive solely because of scientific breakthroughs in the fields of nutrition/animal husbandry/agriculture. In this case though, I'm not convinced that we have the technology (or even the theoretical knowledge) yet to make something that is ""better"" than what we can raise using way simpler technology. I will submit that the meat could be cheaper, with regards to energy, water, time, etc., more humane, and more consistent than beef raised in a holistic setting. But to me, that doesn't make it better. Beef™ could feed millions of hungry people, but will it make them healthier? I don't know, but I'm skeptical.",™

It'll feel like touching your eyes after eating Flaming Hot Cheetos® (don't try this for fun) and your eyes will persistently water because the light is irritating the damaged area.  By chance, do you have dry eyes?  Dry and irritated eyes are sensitive to light.

After priming, test for stain bleed-through by applying the topcoat to a small section. If the stain bleeds through the topcoat, apply a second coat of primer and test again before top-coating the entire area. If bleeding continues, a longer dry time of the primer may be needed before top-coating.  Personally, I would use both if you feel like their is any chance.

I can't think of any reason to justify accepting any belief without skepticism and I have trouble committing myself to a dogmatic religion because of that. Dogma also tends to be a hallmark of Abrahamic religions which would require me to accept beliefs about the world that I haven't seen a good reason to accept yet.  I'm a lot more comfortable with something that's either a personal, subjective expression of value and meaning or something like (some forms of) Buddhism which are presented more along the lines of suggested techniques for improving your life to experiment with, not The True and Correct Way for Everyone to Act and Believe™.

t5_2qgzt,gfixler,1375853675,"The fiberoptic glass is like an idea I had in college back in the late 90s. I was in school for animation, and we used light-tables to do traditional work. I ended up building 2 - a big one with integrated paper shelves, and a portable one that folded up into a little briefcase. I wanted something that was super thin, though, like the tablets we now have, so I thought about projecting light from a little box on the long side of a sheet of milky Plexiglas®. I knew it would be really bright by the light, and dim on the far end, so I wanted to find a way to have the milkiness of the sheet fade from one end to the other in exactly inverse proportion to the little fluorescent bulb's falloff. That lead me to draw up my best guesses of prisms and fiberoptic-embedded sheets. All of them had a mirrored side to reflect all the light toward the drawing paper. I'd seen a few things that felt like this by that point - Indiglo nightlights and the slide scanner light that came with some scanners that put out a perfect, even light. I had an idea later to put a bulb behind a translucent sheet of plastic, then either take a picture, or scan it, and print its inverse on a sheet of acetate. If this was done right, you could make an overlay that would dim down the uneven spots for a dimmer, but overall perfectly even light wall. They did a similar thing with LED HDR TVs, which I first saw at Siggraph back around '05, but they did it with a grid of LEDs behind an LCD, which they tuned to varying grays to even out the light coming through.",®

t5_2qh26,testmypatience,1375858845,"&gt; Do federal regulations govern the use of the designations ""TM"" or ""SM"" or the ® symbol?  &gt; If you claim rights to use a mark, you may use the ""TM"" (trademark) or ""SM"" (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim of a “common-law” mark.  **No registration is necessary to use a ""TM"" or ""SM"" symbol and you may continue to use these symbols even if the USPTO refuses to register your mark.**  Those symbols put people on notice that you claim rights in the mark, although common law doesn't give you all the rights and benefits of federal registration.   &gt; **You may only use the federal registration symbol ""®"" after the USPTO actually registers a mark**, not while an application is pending.  And it may only be used on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the federal trademark registration and while the registration is still alive (you may not continue to use it if you don’t maintain the registration or it expires).  Although there are no specific requirements on where the symbol should be placed relative to the mark, most businesses use the symbol in the upper right corner of the mark.  Note: Because several foreign countries use “®” to indicate that a mark is registered in that country, use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper. - [USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp)  My mistake, it was the ® symbol I was thinking about. You can use the TM and SM just not the ® symbol when unregistered. I bolded the two sections relevant to our discussion.",®

t5_2snpl,vivadisgrazia,1375870159,"So I watched that video ... Do they think Rachel Marsden ""won"" the debate ? Because I think she acted a lot like Ann Coulter and never managed to tackle anything, but straw.   Oh dear gawdiss I looked her up...  [ “Maybe [Pakistani cricket fans] should focus less on cricket and a little more on hygiene,” opined Rachel Marsden on a recent episode of Fox News’ middle-of-the-night talk oddity “Red Eye.” Marsden was adding her two cents to a discussion of murdered Pakistani cricket coach Bob Woolmer, and seemed unaware that she had said anything offensive. But her co-hosts, Greg Gutfeld and Bill Schulz, looked appropriately aghast; Gutfeld was quick to assure viewers that “Red Eye,” the Fox-for-frat-boys show he’s been hosting with gross-out gusto since Feb. 6, did not endorse Marsden’s views on Pakistani hygiene.](http://www.salon.com/2007/03/29/marsden/)  Racist ✔    [...when they brought up the Duke rape case. Gutfeld had asked what should happen to the accuser if all charges are finally dropped, and Marsden had jumped in with unusual speed, pooh-poohing possible repercussions for the woman who claimed she was raped by members of the Duke University lacrosse team a year ago. “Charges are laid, charges are dropped,” said Marsden. “It happens all the time. Unless she can get charged with mischief and they can prove she lied, then no, [ she shouldn't be punished ]. That’s the process and the process works.” But, argued Gutfeld, “Don’t you think that being accused of rape is as bad as being raped? Those guys’ lives were ruined!” Marsden bit back, “Let’s give it 10 years and see if their lives were ruined.” It was all business as usual at “Red Eye,” Fox’s bawdy gabfest of a grab at a youthful audience, starring Gutfeld, comic foil Bill Schulz, and Marsden, a statuesque Canadian who dissects the news with as much Coulter-esque zeal as she can muster while rolling her eyes at her male counterparts. But in the Duke exchange, any viewer who knew anything about Marsden, whom Fox is clearly grooming for brand-name pundit stardom, might have felt a fleeting moment of sympathy for her. That’s because the 31-year-old columnist is already well known in her native Canada as an oft-accused and once-admitted stalker who made questionable rape charges of her own 10 years ago, in a case that eventually cut short the career of a university president and changed the tenor of harassment cases all over Canada. In 1999, a professor at the same university went to the police with charges Marsden was stalking him, and in 2004 she pleaded guilty to criminally harassing a former Vancouver radio host.](http://www.salon.com/2007/03/29/marsden/)   ✔ Serial Stalker    [The whole disaster read like an Oleanna-style wet dream of the right’s most misogynist thinkers, who love nothing more than a woman-makes-it-up tale to underscore the often-unprovable nature of harassment and rape claims. This situation, like the Duke rape case, was a no-win for anyone. Had Marsden been telling the truth about Donnelly, the barrage of sexualized invective hurled her way might have deterred any sane harassment victim from coming forward in the future. The suggestion that she was not telling the truth fueled the fire of those who routinely claim that women love nothing more than to lie about being assaulted and violated. As it was, Donnelly never followed through with formal charges against Marsden; the case was dropped; neither her culpability as stalker nor his culpability as rapist was ever legally established. Perhaps this small mercy in her own experience led Marsden to comment about the Duke case that “the process works.”](http://www.salon.com/2007/03/29/marsden/)   ✔ Repeat ""False accuser"" who ruined lives and was never punished.

t5_2sokd,CrabCommander,1375889734,"Reddit's Ranking algorithm is based primarily on two things, from my understanding:  1) Net votes, meaning the difference between its upvotes and downvotes as a positive[upvoted more] or negative[downvoted more] number.  2) Time since posting.  There is a heavy decay on older posts, keeping them from staying on the front page forever.   Putting these two pieces of information into our magical *redditFormula™* results in us getting another number.  You can think of this number as the post's real 'score'.  Posts are then listed quite simply in the order of their *redditFormula™* score.  This score is recalculated occasionally (every few minutes probably), and the list of posts is then re-ordered appropriately with the posts new *redditFormula™* scores.  -----  Further information:  It's probably worth noting as well, that the formula is a little more complicated that just the two inputs in a simple multiplication or such.  The Net Votes value is actually put on a logarithmic scale, such that the initial few hundred upvotes count for much more than the ones following them.  Time decay is also most likely similarly scaled, such that the initial few hours don't matter, but after that posts probably decay much more quickly.  It may also be worth noting that as far as the ranking is concerned, a post with 1000 upvotes, and 999 downvotes, has the same weight/value as a post with 1 upvote and no downvotes.  It's also further worth noting that as an anti-bot measure, reddit actually massages the numbers of upvotes and downvotes on posts, to confuse vote-spam bots.  From what I understand, the exact # of downvotes and upvotes listed will both randomly shift, however, the net value (Upvotes - Downvotes) will always remain the same.  I believe there's also some logic handling how much weight to give a person's upvotes/downvotes as well, to further try to dilute the effectiveness of spambots.  I believe at some point there was a reddit blog post about the subject, for those further interested.  Edit: Not posted by the reddit blog, but a lot of further detail (with graphs!) on this stuff: http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588",™

t5_2r4b9,eriniki,1375889996,"I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to make *everything* Gender Neutral and Ambiguous and Undefined - Going from sheer logical probabilities there is still a larger chance that a MAAB baby would have a congruent gender identity than a conflicting one - and so making everything Gender Neutral would be in a way forcing a *lack* of gender assignment onto them. Not to mention all the issues and difficulties we have for not being congruent, I wouldn't want to force upon a child unduly. That said I would still **not** do the opposite; I would not wrap a ""boy"" in Blue Always and Never Pink. I wouldn't force gender-segregated haircuts, nor necessarily outfit choices. I may perhaps discourage some outfit choices when socialising with other young kids - as unfortunately, you do have to temper gender neutral and non-binary notions with the fact that you don't really want your child to become a *social pariah at the tender age of five*, for example. But that still does not prevent being open about such things. Additionally, if they showed an interest in dolls instead of cars, or vice-versa depending on gender, I would indulge that interest in them - for children, the things that engage them and interest them are what they will enjoy; And if they enjoy them enough, that interest will remain despite their own internal social pressures and social desires. They don't need extra external pressures atop it.  That said; If they showed an interest in a Gender Neutral toy such as LEGO or other building blocks, I'd indulge the *heck* out of that.

t5_2sokd,teklord,1375891773,"&gt; That may be true of a lot of people who call themselves radical feminists, but does not reflect what radical feminism actually is all about.   If these people are acting under the banner of radical feminism, then that's exactly what I'll call them.  Just because *real* radfemmes disagree with Tumblr Feminism™ does not mean that these people are not using the radfemme banner to propagate their twisted, distorted views on gender inequality.  A lot of these people willingly accept the misandist label.  Half of the blogs I've encountered tag posts with ""misandry"", or make blatantly anti-feminist, anti-male posts that blame men for everything from their anxiety to their bi-polar disorder.  A prime example would be [this](http://everyday-feminism.tumblr.com/) misandrist psychopath, who, for example, said that children in the second grade who roared at a girl at camp was propagating rape culture.  Kids.  Rape culture.  Dinosaurs.  According to this sociopath, men are evil, and women are infallible.   http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/No_True_Scotsman       No True Scotsman is a logical fallacy by which an      individual attempts to avoid being associated with an       unpleasant act by asserting that no true member of       the group they belong to would do such a thing. Instead       of acknowledging that some members of a group have       undesirable characteristics, the fallacy tries to       redefine the group to exclude them. Sentences       such as ""all members of X have desirable trait Y""      then become tautologies, because Y becomes a       requirement of membership in X.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman",™
t5_2qo4s,athos45678,1375891776,"Answering for SAS, but I obviously don't hold the opinions of everyone:  The thing about the San antonio offense is that beyond Tony Parker and Tim Duncan, we don't have any specific scoring threat on any given night. It's all about the matchups. On a team with a weak 2 guard defender, you better expect Danny Green to go full Danny Threen. If we play a team with a defensive sieve at center, it would be too shocking to see splitter go off. So to answer your question, kawhi will probably score more, but that's just because he's getting more efficient and getting slightly more shots as Ginobili continues his decline 😭.  Now when it comes to Duncan, I'm actually unsure what could happen. I expect something like a 16/9/3/.7/2 Stat line. He could continue his renaissance or spiral, and it all has to do with how those damn knees hold up.

That does not mean a rapid return to full employment nor to a low-risk world for investors. It means that the underlying realities of globalisation are becoming clearer: ours is a multipolar world, where the technological convergence between rich nations and capable poor ones is rapid. Middle classes are expanding quickly in emerging markets – a group that politicians focus on everywhere, while ignoring recurrent protests from others, particularly low-skilled labour. The world has and will have high real economic volatility despite relative price stability. This state of affairs is, in fact, a return to the Old Normal of the late 19th century. It is a world that we can understand, even if we do not like it.  In international politics, as has long been foretold, the “American century” of 1945-2000 has given way to a world where the US remains the leader but is losing dominance. So the global system is somewhere between outright conflict and smooth international governance. Reflecting this diffusion of economic and military dominance, a few major currencies – not just one – are increasingly being used for invoicing and reserve management, and that trend will only continue.   The link between currency usage and geopolitical ties is strong, and so the dollar will not be suddenly displaced, but regional alternatives will continue to rise. This has a feel of the 19th century: as Barry Eichengreen, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley has argued, there have been long periods of history where multiple reserve currencies coexisted, like at the end of the 1800s, and we are now in one of those periods – which contributes to economic volatility and uncertainty for national economies and investors.  This multipolar world is also one where no one has sufficient authority to fully protect global public goods, such as intellectual property rights. A weakening of those protections will increase the pace at which emerging markets capable of converging will catch up with advanced economies. Some see this trend as a result of China’s rise or digital piracy, but remember that Germany and the US reverse engineered British innovations in the Victorian age, and even pirated the IP of Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle.  At the same time, a lack of IP protection reduces incentives to invest in innovation, as Elhanan Helpman of Harvard has demonstrated. So the technological leaders will advance more slowly, which will also boost catch-up. This, in turn, will erode the relative power of the US and other advanced economies, further reducing their ability to enforce IP rules. The whole cycle will increase competitive pressure on incumbent multinational businesses.  Active national rivalries, multiple reserve currencies, eroding intellectual property rights and increased corporate competition in many industries will increase volatility of the real economy and diminish investment. Large state-backed national infrastructure projects, as dominated late 19th century development, will be a growing asset class as a result. The division between investments yielding safer low returns and speculative higher-return assets will be quite sharp.  But as was the case from the 1840s until the first world war, today’s convergence and competition – and the volatility that results – can and I believe will persist for a long time without globalisation breaking down. It held up for a long time then because, even as there were arms races and conflicts, France and Germany, let alone the UK and the US, had an interest in maintaining the status quo. And, as then, today’s dominant powers wish to maintain their legitimacy against non-state actors, including terrorists and revolutionaries, and preserve cross-border flows of trade and finance.  Furthermore, politicians are responsive to their own upper middle classes, whose wellbeing depends upon maintaining globalisation and keeping international disputes within limits. These groups are also creditors whose desires for price stability, combined with the pressures from currency competition, creates strong incentives for keeping inflation low. On average, such motivations will dominate over temptations to inflate their problems away. So, just as most countries usually adhered to the gold standard over a century ago, they will stick with independence for their central banks and fiscal consolidation now.  There was little or no response to recurring spasms of protest or calls for radical change by low-skilled workers in the 19th century, except when mass movements were assimilated into mainstream political parties with support from the elites. Something similar is at work today, with the protests of southern Europe and the demands of the Occupy movement largely ignored by policy makers catering to the voters of the (older) bourgeoisie.  The Old Normal is thus a tale of the global economy returning to unfettered markets in many ways, and – at the national level – to more volatile economic conditions with slower average growth as a result. This is a situation which I am predicting, not endorsing. While domestic politics and international relations have changed greatly since 1914, the creation of safety nets and welfare states (even if now curtailed), and the development of nuclear deterrence among the major powers only strengthen the status quo bias of the current governments.  The Old Normal is not nice, but it is likely to last.",©

They are a downvote brigade and do nothing to help fight real misogyny.  Instead, my sexuality as a heterosexual male is seen instantly as evil, anything even remotely not politically correct is made into a huge issue, even when it was stated sarcastically and with tongue-in-cheek humor as the basis (as opposed to actual insulting), and they always have a double standard when it comes to their own prejudices.    Somebody very dear to me was a victim of rape and I know more than many other guys, the seething hate one can have for men who take advantage of women.  I had to go through therapy since I had a list of rapists and molesters I was willing to attack at the end of High School a decade ago for what they did to that person and others dear to me.  I understand the anger and hate women can and should have to men who treat them as second class citizens.  But that person dear to me and others see SRS and Tumblr Feminism™ as nothing but a cancer and a false flag on a real set of issues modern society needs to fight against.  edit: [here's a r/4chan](http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/19gi6a/is_the_alleged_srs_invasion_of_4chan_real/) post questioning it and [an image](http://i.imgur.com/3gKcVEh.jpg) from 4chan about the attempted ""invasion"" of 4/chan... this was a number of months ago.

In Real World™ Capitalism, what happens is that the market consolidates and then begins to optimize the amount of profit that can be made. What this means is that the publishers look at the options available to them:  * 1) We could spend X dollars on a big AAA Twitch shooter that will only sell on PC's. * 2) We could spend X dollars on a big AAA Console shooter that will have 4x more potential customers because we can sell it on PC, XBox, PlayStation, and Wii.  So what happens? The company chooses option #2. **Every. Damn. Time.** Twitch games completely disappear from the face of the Earth.  This is the point of the original poster. Consoles and gamepads have made the FPS market worse. We used to have Twitch FPS's, we used to have slower story FPS's. Now we only have one. It doesn't matter if you like the newer style FPS's better. The market is provably worse because there's now less variation, and this is traceable directly to consoles and gamepads.",™

More-sustainable production of natural foods is possible. The technologies are available. Why don't we take those steps, stand on the shoulders of those giants, rather than switching to Soylent™?   Besides the uncertain sustainability of this vs. the aforementioned food production techniques, I'm not comfortable with the idea of a centralized, corporate solution for feeding those 9 billion.

It turns out that ""Pyrex"" and ""Pyroceram"" are two different materials. From the [Corning Life Sciences website](http://www.corning.com/lifesciences/us_canada/en/technical_resources/product_guid/shp/pyro.aspx):   &gt; In 1952, one of Corning's scientists, Dr. S. D. Stookey, made and accidental but important discovery when an oven malfunction overheated a piece of photosensitive glass on which he was working. The glass turned milky white as a result of heat-induced crystallization and did not break when dropped.  The result was a ceramic-like material, the first in a new family of glass-ceramic materials that has led Corning into several new businesses.  &gt; This new Pyroceram® glass-ceramic material was extremely durable, corrosion resistant and had a very low coefficient of expansion. It was also transparent to radar, which made it ideal for use as nosecones on anti-aircraft missiles (Figure 1).  &gt; These space age characteristics allowed Pyroceram glass-ceramics to be very successfully adapted for commercial use as Corningware® products for cooking in 1959 (Figure 2). Pyroceram glass-ceramic's transparency to radar (microwaves) also allowed Corningware products to be used in microwave ovens, greatly extending their versatility in the kitchen.  Not heat shield material as I recalled but transparent to radar, which *does* make it more valuable in today's microwave infested kitchens.",®

t5_mouw,Metallio,1375976184,"Well motherfucker (not you, just cursing).  This requires further analysis.  Study 013 subgroup was 156 individuals.  Study 015's similar subgroup (requested additional info) was 398 and showed a 5.4% reduction as opposed to an increase.  The conclusion:  &gt;Therefore, while the subgroup from study 013 remains a concern of the clinical review  team, there is some evidence that this represented an unbalanced subgroup where  Gardasil™ recipients at baseline had more risk factors for development of CIN 2/3 or  worse.  Furthermore, when the subgroups from three studies are combined, these groups  appear to be more similar.  Finally, there is compelling evidence that the vaccine lacks  therapeutic efficacy among women who have had prior exposure to HPV and have not  cleared previous infection (PCR positive and seropositive), which represented  approximately 6% of the overall study populations.    I haven't found followup studies yet, but there are a number of groups in that pdf that include PCR or seropositive individuals only.  Study 13 is the only one that shows an increased incidence of dysplasia and I tend to agree with the statement above; i.e. that the most likely case is that the vaccine is much less effective in people with an active infection and that the 013 outcome is a statistical fluke with accidental inclusion of more susceptible individuals in the study group.  I'm going to maintain my stance that I'd like the shots, especially as a male who doesn't have the same sort of environment conducive to growth of HPV as a woman does.  I suppose that it's possible that the vaccine really does increase the chances of CIN 2/3 and carcinoma, but the mechanism of action needs elucidation before I'll accept it the conclusion that it's a ""well-known fact"".  This is the FDA stating that it has concerns and needs more data to disprove the 013 group's finding (which is at odds with other group findings) and Merck not really giving a damn because there's not much of a market for older people getting the shot long-term since most people will be getting it as kids.  Within a generation they won't have a commercial need to be able to market to older individuals and the cost of approval for that market exceeds any expected return.  TLDR: It's a cherry-picked number.  That doesn't make it NOT ""troubling"" and worth keeping an eye on, but there's too much other data indicating the exact opposite to call it a fact.  Let's see some more studies.",™

And someone will always post the chicken. [by /u/saididnever] - it's fake and here's why **[✔]** &gt;&gt;The beer holder in this video is fake. It is from an advertisement and is made by suspending the beer itself, and then just have a flexible arm that is attached to the guy (so it is actually the beer that is holding the guy, not the guy holding the beer) &gt;&gt; The technology does exist however. The [MoVi](http://nofilmschool.com/2013/04/movi-gyro-stabilized-handheld-camera-gimbal/) steadicam rig uses something like this, and allows a person to run around with a camera without it bobbing around. A second operator will be at a remote station where he can control the camera and see what it records through a remote viewfinder. &gt;&gt; It would not work very well in planes. First of all, in order to make a gyroscopic stable cabin, you would need to have a cabin suspended within the cabin to allow it room to move. This would take up a lot of space, making the already small cabin even smaller, not to mention that it would take up a lot of extra weight. &gt;&gt; And if you were to make such a cabin, it would not need to be done with gyroscopic stabilized actuators (which would add even more weight and consume quite a lot of energy to operate). It would be enough to simply suspend the inner cabin on a spring system, much like that of a suspension in a car. &gt;&gt; But even if you did this it wouldn't make much of a difference. It might be able to remove some of the more violent shakes, but for most parts, I don't think you'd be able to feel a difference. The fact that the airplane is flying is more or less like having an extremely huge air-mattress as suspension. The wings smooths out more turbulence than a gyroscopic cabin would ever be able to. &gt;&gt; One could of course simply add suspension to each seat, but I think that would be even more uncomfortable, also be very heavy, be far less sturdy in case of a crash. &gt;&gt; Back in the early days of passenger ships there were some experiments done with anti-roll cabins. In short, the cabin area of the ship was on a huge axis through the hull of the ship, and allowed to roll independently. It would be weighted at the bottom so it would always stay horizontal, even when the ship was rolling from side to side in the waves.

The ones on team spawn with 80% handicap on.  ☺MixMatch of Death - Randomly: 2v2v2v2, 4v4 or 8FFA where randomly during the game different events start. Simmilar to the events that were in the Red Bull Lan event that Day9 casted where ""strange"" things happends randomly. Ex: everyone gets gold minerals in their base for some time, controling the watchtowers gives extra income, random nukes spawn, etc etc...  ☺Position Control - Randomly spawns as 2v2v2v2, 8FFA or 4v4. Everything is normal except that in the start of the game the game randomly chooses a in-game time in the future between 5:00 - 25:00. The player/team that controls a certain area, preferably the center of the map, at that time wins. (Controling the area means that no enemy units can be inside the control point.)  ☺Lods of Emone - Randomly chooses 2v2v2v2, 4v4 or 8FFA. Everyone starts with INFINITE money.  ☺Defined Quantity - Randomly chooses 2v2v2v2, 4v4 or 8FFA. At the start of the game all players are able to vote between: max 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 supply/psi/control per player.  ☺Monobattles - Randomly chooses 2v2v2v2, 4v4 or 8FFA. At the start of the game each player must choose one unit and during the game that player can only build that unit.  ☺Abilityfest - Randomly chooses 2v2v2v2, 4v4 or 8FFA. At the start of the game the players vote between different abilities or such. The option with the most votes makes it so that ALL units in the game share this ability. Ex: all units are cloaked, all units have blink, all units have Ignite Afterburners, etc  ☺United We Stand - A 2v2v2v2 but the two players in each team control the same army, units, resources etc. So it's basicly a 1v1v1v1 but there's two players behind each army.",☺

Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis.   ✴On a 10+:   * the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one * the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much) * the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it  ✴On a 7–9, each role performs their job as expected:   * the normal number of rations are consumed,   * the journey takes about as long as expected,  * no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.  You can’t assign more than one job to a character. If you don’t have enough party members, or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it had been assigned and the responsible player had rolled a 6.  Distances in Dungeon World are measured in rations. A ration is the amount of supplies used up in a day. Journeys take more rations when they are long or when travel is slow.  A perilous journey is the whole way between two locations. You don’t roll for one day’s journey and then make camp only to roll for the next day’s journey, too. Make one roll for the entire trip.  This move only applies when you know where you’re going. Setting off to explore is not a perilous journey. It’s wandering around looking for cool things to discover. Use up rations as you camp and the GM will give you details about the world as you discover them.",✴

That would mean anyone not L1 certified would have to have someone else there with them. My assumption was that if you were not under CF RRG that you would therefore not need to be L1 certified to coach.  Of course, anyone can coach circuit training indistinguishable from CrossFit™ without a cert of any kind but that's a different situation.  Thanks for the research. Learned something new today.",™

t5_2ug83,Pyrolytic,1376014856,"Like I suggested to OP (and would suggest to anyone dealing with someone like this), if they're &lt;18 then tell their parents.  Hopefully the parents still have some modicum of control in this situation and can work with the kid.  There's not likely to be anything the police can directly do at this point so don't really need to bring them into it and that would just escalate the situation further.  Notifying parents should be the first round of action.  If the creep is &gt;18 then the previous bit of advice doesn't *really* apply since he is outside the reach of his parents.  If he has roommates you could potentially talk with them, but that's not likely to have much sway either.  Regardless of age I think OP (or anyone in her situation) should immediately cut contact with the creep.  Continuing contact is a recipe for Bad Shit™.  A log should also be started at this point with any contact from the creep, times, locations, etc.  A full log may be needed later for police to use as an actionable item.  The local DA would likely need it for evidence as well.  Additionally, I'd have OP (or anyone else in her situation) reach out to other friends of the creep and suggest they do the same.  If they can establish a pattern of behavior then it's going to lend all the more credibility to the claim.  Telling the OP (or anyone in her situation) to not take action only encourages a disenfranchisement and feelings of powerlessness.  The targets of the creeps in these situations need to feel empowered to take action.  They should not be told to just be quiet and take this, working in the shadows on some sort of lame PR smear campaign.  I encourage OP (or anyone in her situation) to take bold action and let the creep know they're the fucked up one who needs to seriously change their behavior.",™

The general appearance of one is like this (🍔)The defining characteristic of a Cheeseburger is that in addition to the buns, and patty (or patties) there also is the Cheese layer(s).

From the roadway perspective, we not only travel from one place to another, we see landscape in a varied and complex manner. I use water on the windshield to create a shifting lens for the way we see the environment: it both highlights and obscures our viewing. Perspectives slip and compress, while shapes and colors merge into one another. I also work with relationships between surface and depth, between flatness and illusion.

t5_2t9dp,redvolunteer,1376053698,"&gt;And Anarchists have the best examples of real socialist societies at their side: Free territory  Come, pray tell us about the tragedy of the Ukrainian Free Territory, that shining bastion of *real socialism in practice*.  &gt;&gt;[With the massive land reform of the revolution, most peasants now had access to their own land. There was almost no interest in joining anarchist-led communes.](http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml)  &gt;&gt;[When they occupied towns, the Makhnovists would declare null and void all laws and state structures. In the midst of a civil war, they emptied all the prisons and jails. Then they would hand out all the money and food until it was gone.52 They destroyed the existing economic and political structures and then denied responsibility for the consequences. There was no thought of rationing the resources because there was no consideration of problems of production beyond small-scale family agriculture.](http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml)   &gt;&gt;[When local railway and telegraph workers who had not been paid for months asked for help, Makhno told them, “We are not like the Bolsheviks to feed you, we don’t need the railways; if you need money, take the bread from those who need your railways and telegraphs.”53 In reality, the Makhnovists did need the railways. But Makhno declared his army exempt from rail charges. In the context of civil war and mass famine, his was less a call for workers’ power and more a prescription for starvation.](http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml)  &gt;&gt;[Makhno issued a currency that carried the text: “feel free to forge this.” He also declared valid all currencies, including those of defunct governments. While this may just seem like Abbie Hoffman-style antics, the ensuing mass inflation was devastating for workers. Unlike the peasants who grew their own food, the workers were dependent on a wage to eat and desperately needed price controls.](http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml)  Anybody who claims that the short-sighted actions of Makhno, which threatened the lives of millions of workers, both militarily and with regards to starvation during a period of protracted civil war amounts to *real socialism in practice*, is either utterly deluded or simply ignorant of that historical period. If your basis for understanding socialism is Makhno, it's no wonder Anarchists haven't historically achieved anything of worth.  I'm not even going to touch on Catalonia, as it's simply more of the same; Anarchists misunderstanding material conditions and fatalistically placing idealism and martyrdom above concrete reality.  &gt;It is the leninists who think that they can dictate their way to socialism that ignore the conditions of the world around them.   It pains me that you don't even see the irony in this.  &gt;You can't go from a feudal society to a socialist society.  Comrades Mao and Stalin would disagree, in principle *and* practice. Of course, ""STATE CAPITALISM"" is the asinine response I expect to get back after that remark. Don't bother, it's just embarrassing to read.  &gt;You can't put in place highly centralised power structures and expect the state to dissolve: power is sticky, it doesn't slip away easily.  Well shit, I've never heard that one before. That just shatters everything. I guess decentralised, non-hierarchical co-operatives really *are* the only way forward.  On second thoughts, no. You seem to have little understanding of Marxism; the purpose of socialism isn't to act as some sort of rapid two, or five-year transition stage to FULL COMMUNISM™. It's a lengthy process which creates an environment conducive to the ultimate creation of post-scarcity conditions; at which point only, will Communism will become a viable proposition.  Further, if you had any experience of actually working with people to achieve results under pressure, you'd understand that not everybody's opinion is valid, and sometimes you don't have the luxury of explaining the minutiae to come to a jolly state of consensus. Here's a novel idea. times of crisis require hierarchy, obedience and discipline. Rapid industrialisation requires hierarchy, obedience and discipline. This ungrounded, irrational fetishisation of 'centralised power structures' is why Anarchists have consistent problems being taken seriously by, pretty much everybody.  &gt;Furthermore, it is the Leninists create many such situations of ""dire peril"" through state terror.  Here's a fun game to play. It's called ""find the instance of *state terror*, look at the strategic, material conditions of the time - try to ignore your fantastic 20/20 hindsight and ask yourself if it was necessary, understandable, a mistake, or my personal favourite, **IRRATIONAL BOLSHEVIK PERSECUTION**"". It's quite the mouthful.  &gt; Leninism is to blame for creating the power structures and policies necessary for a ruling class to oppress the majority.  Ok.",™

t5_2y2sm,_whistler,1376056471,"Fair enough.  I'll see what I can do.  I'll start by being up front about my experience with women, which is fairly limited.  I'm not one of these guys with a handful of spinning plates, nor have I been practicing seduction for many years.  I lost my virginity when I was 26, and as I said before, I'm about to turn 30.  In that short time, over two years was lost to a relationship that started off Blue Pill, and ended once I fully accepted the Red Pill.  There are many more experienced Red Pill submitters here than I.  What I *do* have going for me is a combination of balls, hunger, and insight.  So.  Take my words with the proverbial grain of salt.  As I mentioned before, I don't think of what I do as **Asshole Game™**.  My friends seem to think I'm an asshole, so I've sort of accepted their external perspective.  But you may disagree.  Even if I do run **Asshole Game™**, it's difficult for me to form one-off examples because that's like demonstrating individual brush strokes of a painting without taking into account the mental and emotional state of the artist at the time of the original work.  There's always a cause behind the effect, and I have the overwhelming urge to furiously type out my entire life story along with all my research and experimentation that led me to where I am.  I'll refrain from the life story, however, and try to stay within the general scope of your request.  Now.  Let's dive in with a numbered list.  1. **Abundance Mentality** - If we're focusing exclusively on the masculine/feminine dynamic, this is where it begins.  I don't care if the girl in front of me slaps me and runs shrieking, or unzips my fly and climbs aboard right then and there.  Whether I've just met her or been dating her for months, there are plenty more around.  A girl's reactions to me are her own - out of my *direct* control - so why the fuck would I worry about it?  2. **Self-Assurance** - This follows naturally from the first point.  When I'm not desperately putting all my investment in the girl, I'm much more highly invested in myself.  *I'm in it for me, sweetheart, and if you don't like it, move the fuck along.  Shit test?  What the fuck is that?  Oh, you think you can control me by playing the victim...that's cute.*  With self-assurance, I say what's on my mind.  Beyond taking into account the situational context, I don't worry too much about framing myself because my natural frame is the most flattering one.  It suits.  So I say and do what I want, and I laugh at them and smack their asses when they give me ""the look"".  3. **Amused Mastery** - Just like before, this follows naturally from the previous point.  When I'm self-assured in my masculinity, the femininity of my girl is a delightful diversion.  I'll enjoy it the way I'd enjoy a double-scoop ice cream cone: that is, you'll make it the way I order it, thanks.  *Running out of mint chocolate-chip?  Better run to the back and get some then.  I'll wait right here.  Oh, and I'll take a discount for my patience.  You're welcome.*  You know, I actually said that to my girl recently?  You're welcome.  I'd idly turned her over my knee and begun alternating spanking her ass cheeks and her pussy, while we were watching some show on TV.  When I got tired of it, I told her she liked it, and she agreed.  So I said ""You're welcome, but if you want me to do it again you'd better position yourself more carefully next time.""  The look I got was priceless.  I digress.  Amused Mastery.  You can't do it effectively if you're overly emotional, either.  If I felt passionately about my double-scoop ice cream cone, I'd be fucking pissed they ran out of my favorite flavor.  But how pathetic is that?  It's just ice-cream.  *You're just one girl among many, sweetie, and I'll keep this smirk on my face, thanks.  Don't like it?  Yeah, you do.  You're talking too much, put my cock in your mouth.*  As long as you can keep this mindset during a staring match, usually you end up with your cock in her mouth.  Really, that's about it for mindset.  If you want actionable examples...well, I'll give you anecdotes from my own experience.  Take from them what you will.  * Had my girl over for supper.  Baked lamb chops in a cast iron skillet with french green beans side.  Upon her first bite, my little lady had the good manners to cover her mouth, make a gagging sound, and rush to the trash can to spit out the meat.  Apparently she doesn't really like meat, or vegetables, or anything healthy for that matter.  I have no idea how she has stayed as attractive into her early twenties as she is, with no nutritional values.  Anyway, as I was opening my mouth to tell her to get out and not return until she'd learned some manners, tears began welling up in her eyes and she apologized profusely.  She explained that she didn't like most meat and vegetables.  I explained, sternly, that there was no excuse whatsoever, short of a food allergy, for the reaction I'd just witnessed.  Weakly, she came back with ""I can't help it...""  *Yes, you can.  You know how I know?  You don't like those vegetables on your plate, but you're going to eat every single one.*  That's right.  I made her eat her vegetables, something her mother apparently overlooked.  Really, I gave her an option: get out, or eat your vegetables.  She chose to eat them.  **I cannot abide a picky eater.**  She eats what I set in front of her now, and she's learning to cook properly under my tutelage.  * Also on the topic of nutrition, I'd noticed my girl eating an abundance of sweets recently.  I mentioned it a couple of times, but hadn't addressed it properly yet.  I let her take me to a county fair the other day, and after observing her intake of sweets there, bluntly told her we'd have to put my plans of taking her to the state fair on hold, because she'd still be burning off all the calories from the current outing.  She now asks my permission before eating dessert, and she does it with a smile.  * Had my girl climb on top of me and ride my cock while we were sitting on the sofa, as a reward for good behavior.  She was having a difficult time keeping her balance and keeping me inside her at the same time, and after enough slipping out, I started going soft.  She made a comment about it, nothing mean or spiteful but still a bit of a shit test.  So I turned her over, cock-slapped her face a few times, and explained ""I don't get hard for you to enjoy yourself while I sit here passively.  I get hard to fuck you **my way**.""  I demonstrated for a while.  Took her fifteen minutes before she could move again, and she was *very* affectionate for the rest of the day.  I'm kinda grasping at straws to come up with any good examples here.  See, none of the things I've said seem to me like they're any part of an overarching **Asshole Game™**.  I just look at all this as dominant, forthright masculinity.  Do I seem like an asshole to you?  I'd be interested in the general opinion, because my friends think I am, but I don't really see it.

t5_2qimj,Indestructavincible,1376067038,"I'm not him, but here:  McLaren opted for a radical approach for its 2013 car, but it was soon obvious the season would be a struggle. Jonathan Noble talked with Martin Whitmarsh about what went wrong    	By Jonathan Noble  	AUTOSPORT group F1 editor  	     McLaren ended 2012 with the fastest car in the Formula 1 field and confident of a 2013 championship challenge.  But it eschewed the successful formula of its 2012 machine and instead came up with a radical design for the new season.  The team was adamant at its launch that this avenue offered greater development potential and that to simply evolve would have been insufficient, despite most of its rivals taking that course.  McLaren's theory was soon proved wrong. With over half the season gone, it is yet to take a podium finish, let alone a race win and rather than chasing the title, it is chasing Force India for fifth in the constructors' table.  In a candid interview with AUTOSPORT's group F1 editor Jonathan Noble, McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh opened up about the mistakes that had sent his squad's season off course, the lessons learned, and how close it came to ditching the 2013 design and reviving last year's car.  AUTOSPORT: Is it too simplistic to trace these problems back to a single meeting where a decision was taken to follow a radical route?  Martin Whitmarsh: Inevitably it is too simplistic, but in a way I don't think that's a bad analysis. If you look back on it, the root of where we are today is probably around a year ago. I don't know the date, I've tried not to go there, but now you've asked me to...  Clearly nine, 10 months ago we had the fastest car. So we looked foolish at the beginning of this year to have abandoned quite a lot of the elements of that, not evolved it and had a step backwards.  Inevitably people say 'why did you do it?' And I think the simple answer is ambition, and ambition getting the better of you.  Winter testing suggested McLaren was in for a tough year Winter testing suggested McLaren was in for a tough year © LAT The feeling was 'how do we make a step?' The goal is to come out with a dominant car. There are a whole lot of studies that are going on all the time. The feeling was 'right, let's try to make a big step. Let's incorporate this, this, this and this'. We believed all the tests we'd done validated those concepts and the best thing to do was bring them together.  We brought it together, but it didn't come together in a harmonious package. We lost sight of the overall structure and we ended up with a situation where we were uncompetitive.  In the meantime we actually had a parallel programme developing last year's car and we made a reasonable amount of progress on last year's car.  So you can look at eight or nine months ago when we had the fastest car, but the decisions were taken already by then. The decisions that would now be either challenged, regretted or whatever, had happened.  People said 'you had the fastest car, why don't you just bring it back?' And we got close to doing so in Malaysia.  But I think it would not be quick enough now because our competitors have evolved their cars, made progress, and we're behind.  I think we lost those four months or six months of development, and that's difficult to catch up with good competitors.  I think we're learning a lot, not just about the obvious thing - which is when you've got a competitive car with relatively stable regulations, have greater due diligence before you make wholesale changes to what you have.  But technically we're learning. The whole flow structure around the car is dramatically different and we're tuning and adjusting that.  I'm an optimist, but you can learn more from mistakes and having to really question yourself, soul search and do the analysis of what you have to do.  When we gathered in Malaysia to think about going to China with last year's car, the feeling was 'is this going to get us to a winning situation this year? No. Will we learn much from doing that or will we learn more and be better prepared by persevering with it?'  ",©
t5_2qimj,Indestructavincible,1376067055,"continued.......    The team came close to racing last year's car The team came close to racing last year's car © LAT I actually do think that overall it's been a very painful but powerful learning exercise.  As soon as something's not working as predicted, you've got to find out why. That analysis is quite a beneficial process.  Often you get a perfect storm of things. There were a number of things that went frustratingly wrong that lulled us into a false sense.  What went wrong fundamentally was that in the ambition to have a dominant car, there were about four or five concept changes to what ultimately appeared to be a competitive package. When you're developing the car, you say things like 'maybe we should have a different suspension geometry?', 'maybe we should have a different wing philosophy', 'maybe we should have a different sidepod?'. You do those things in isolation and you try to be diligent about. One thing appears to give you something, another thing appears to give you something. Then you stick them all together...  If every one of those is worth 0.1s, you put them all together and it seldom gives you 0.6s or 0.7s, and generally doesn't give you the 0.5s. In this case it certainly didn't.  Inevitably we know a lot more now than we did at the beginning of the year or this time last year.  AS: Did Paddy Lowe's departure hinder the recovery this year?  MW: Paddy was effectively with us until the car was launched. With all due respect, and I'm not blaming anyone, Paddy was the technical director through this process. But having a good mind like Paddy involved could have been beneficial. But we've got some good minds working hard on it.  AS: You say five elements didn't work together. Was there one thing that was particularly costly?  MW: No, we lost control of the overall flow structure. What you tend to have in an aerodynamic development team is people who are working on the front end or the front wing, or the rear floor, or the sidepods... You have a little bit more compartmentalisation than you would like and the organisation has to pull together a synthesis and make sure that there is actually some synergy and cohesion between all those elements. I'm not trying to blame any particular element, we just didn't pull it all together.  Sometimes you're lucky in life and you stick all the elements together and they do add up. Sometimes they just don't.  Paddy Lowe Mercedes Lowe left the team early in the year © XPB There were times when it's come good and we didn't really know why. At the end of last year, some of the developments overperformed. And that was another thing that caused this: we're always looking at the correlation between full-scale windtunnel and CFD, and there's always an offset between those, and we work on that.  The imperical and the analytical analysis is never perfect. Last year at the end of the year we were actually over-delivering at the track. That was another thing that I think has exacerbated this situation - that the real [2012] car was actually better than the windtunnel.  So certainly at the beginning of this year we were underdelivering at the track compared to the windtunnel, whereas last year's car was overdelivering.  The other thing is that as we got closer to the season, the pressure mounts on every part of engineering to deliver performance. So in the case of aerodynamics, we were growing downforce but at the expense of rideheight sensitivity.  So we ended up with some reasonable headline figures, but as we did that, we had a much more rideheight sensitive set of figures at that time. It looked fine, but at the early races we were very, very rideheight sensitive, which had all sorts of implications. One was that in order to get that performance you had a car that was much, much too stiff and much, much too low. It was a pretty uncomfortable car to drive.  AS: What have you changed to make sure this doesn't happen again?  MW: I think we'd lost a little bit of the link between the trackside aero team and the aero development team. By reason of personality, evolution, lack of diligence, that had become weaker than it needed to be. I think we've recognised that that had to change.  Every week you're reviewing aerodynamic options and making decisions, and there wasn't sufficient input from the 'real world' aerodynamcists and engineers about what was useable performance.  In the run-in to the start of this season, people felt the pressure to deliver downforce. They did so, but effectively they were delivering aerodynamic performance that was very difficult to obtain in the real world.  I understand the pressures that caused it, but that happened. I think also strengthening the control of the aerodynamic sub-groups to make sure that the sum of the whole really is in the right direction, rather than hoping that it's all going to add up together.  McLaren is convinced it has learned from its mistakes McLaren is convinced it has learned from its mistakes © LAT AS: The drivers seemed more positive in Hungary. Is it all coming together now?  MW: I think we've done some decent learning and there's an enhanced confidence in what we know about the car and what we have to do. We've got a direction. There's a feeling that we can get more out of this car.  AS: How confident are you that you're not going to go down the same alley again next year?  MW: I'm confident of that, but no one can be confident that you're necessarily going to deliver enough performance next year.  What is a competitive benchmark? Who's going to make the breakthrough? I think we're going to have a much bigger spread of performance at the beginning of next year.  Some people will have overperformed. It's not all about good judgement and good decisions. You might claim that when you're competitive, but sometimes you'll luck in to a zone.  Everyone's going to be excited, wary and interested in what's going to happen next year. We have a very significant set of rule changes and there's going to be a greater disparity in car performance and a greater variety in car design. No one's going to be comfortable in the run-in to next season.",©

It can perfectly reach 80 to 85 degrees and the processor will still be OK. The cooling fan is in charge to keep that temperature there.    &gt;If the processor temperature reaches 100 degrees or more it will send a signal to the motherboard to shut down to prevent mayor damages and most likely it will not be possible to turn the computer back in until it cools down.    &gt;The normal processor temperature will depend on the chassis type, the hardware involved and the location of the computer, and it usually is lower than the Tcase.   According to [this data sheet](http://ark.intel.com/products/52210/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_70-GHz), the Tcase for a 2500k is 72.6C, but according to the rep, it's okay if it goes up to 15 degrees above that.

Own it. Girls are attracted to kindness and thoughtfulness - shit, everyone is. You know the Good Guy Greg meme? The things people write on that meme - that's what being a genuinely nice person is about. People appreciate other people who treat them well. If you're not sure if someone is a Nice Guy™ or a nice person, ask yourself this: Do they only act nice if they want something from someone? Are they nice to the girl they're taking out to dinner but a dick to the waiter? Could I count on this person if shit hit the fan and I really needed help? Answers no, no, yes = nice person.

That's a cute statement, considering I don't see too many millionaires who grew up in trailer parks. Most people who become wealthy in the US grew up in at least middle class circumstances or better, with supportive family members, a decent education, etc. And a sizable percentage of those grew up in even more posh circumstances.  &gt; They do not depend on other people to make them owners.  For every one ""rags to riches"" story I come across, I seem to find significantly more ""riches to more riches"" stories. Funny how that works, isn't it? How wealth begets wealth in a majority of situations?  &gt; You either have that ability or you don't.  So what you're saying here is that some people are more gifted with finances than others? What, like winning a genetic lottery and succeeding *due to chance*? But wait! I thought that owners were masters of their own destinies!

Yeah, that takes pretty damn long and is accompanied by a shitload of paperwork and red tape.  The machine that examines stuff and tells you what's in it? It exists, sort of. It'll only work for a select few compounds at a time, and there's quite a bit of prep work involved.  Also, a 98% match to someone's DNA profile usually means they *didn't* do it. There are exceptions, but they're rare and accompanied by lots of calculations.  Not to mention that your conclusive evidence will still have to hold up in court, and by no means guarantees a conviction.  Also, it's insanely rare to find as much evidence as they find on that show. And the information they can give you from the trusty Eyeball MkII™? If they can teach me how to do that, I'm a happy man.  By the way, evidence on a crime scene is not nearly as reconstructive as they make it seem.

The living room window is broken, the shards are inside the living room. Valuables are missing from the house. There's a brick on the floor. There are two fingerprints, an index finger print and a middle finger print, on the inside of the broken window, near the edge. There's also a bit of blood on a sharp edge very close to the fingerprints.

Even if you had it in the past and it went away. And you are what? 6 weeks? Many women dont even get their morning sickness til 8-10 if they get it at all (if you dont get it I am severely jealous, mine was so bad I was hospitalized)  &gt;I constantly have a bit of cramping, almost like tugging.  This is normal, so much is going on down there that it is quite amazing that it doesnt hurt worse. Incrrased blood flow, increased hormones, beginning to stretch, get where im going with this? Some cramping is totally normal and a good thing because it is caused by a healthy pregnancy (never ignore severe cramping though you shouldnt have that issue as you already know its not ectopic)  &gt;I still occasionally have spotting.   Also normal, you likely have a tiny subchorionic hematoma. A perfectly harmless (in cases where it is small) cause of bleeding.  The fact that you have seen your womb is not emptying and see your hormones climbing should help in reassuring you that you have a healthy pregnancy going on!  &gt;At night, I can't help getting anxious and thinking about all the things that might go wrong, all the symptoms that should or shouldn't be there.

t5_2rd6n,Mickey_Maus,1376093875,"Strap in, haha. This is going to take a while.  Well, it started as low fantasy Greco-Roman. Then I added some mythological ""contraptions"", a la Bubo from Clash of the Titans. Little things at first, like owls to deliver letters and servants, then I added some automatons. Then I added big clockwork siege weapons and scorpion-walkers and mechanical minotaurs.  The automatons seems out of place in the world, and so did all the machines. The phalanx and gladius now seemed a bit underpowered.  So I bumped up the tech level to give the humans the advantage again. But I still liked the antiquity setting, and the feel of the Hellenistic world. So now it was Roman galleys with cannons and Legionaries with arquebuses.    Once that happened, I added airships. I made the world bigger because travel was faster. I added trains (because I like trains...), and the world got even bigger! The backstory began to pop up, and the ""gods"" of the world started to evolve. Before I knew it the gods were a little too powerful, so I added magic––which, before then, wasn't really a major force in the world.  But that magic was a bit science-y. It relied on external power-sources channeled through human-made objects, rather than innate ability. Like a Power Glove. Powered by Power Gems.   Though with less stupid names...  Something (I forget what, Attack on Titan or one of the animes I was watching then) inspired me to add giant decaying walls littered around the landscape. So suddenly my civilization was living in the ruins of a long fallen even GREATER civilization. The walls became the remnants of a colonization ship which crashed thousands of years ago, carrying the progenitors of my current race.  Once that happened, I got the image of people jumping around these ten-story ruins, surveying the damage caused by a rampaging mechanical basilisk. So I gave them mechanical exoskeletons to let them jump really high and fast. Soon, they had magically powered suits.  Gunpowder and flintlock was pretty obsolete. So I brought swords back, but now they're Absurdly Sharp Blades™, wielded by super strong, super fast Roman legionaries.  However, I liked the idea of ranged weapons. So those arquebuses became blasters, powered by magical stones (Power Gems!) which were actually the essence this world's analogue to Uranus, who was shattered by this world's version of Cronus.  The airships evolved from dirigibles to something akin to a space ship (think the Bebop or Serenity), though without the space.  And then I took a look back at what I had written (over the course of three or so months), and realized this was probably the most extreme example of Tech Creep I'd every experienced.",™

t5_2qhhk,throw667,1376097074,"The Backyard Dog Perhaps the biggest and most widely held misconception about dogs is the belief that they will be healthy and happy living only in the backyard. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Current studies in dog psychology show that dogs isolated in backyards are highly likely to develop serious behavioral problems that often result in euthanasia for the animal.  WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:  DOGS ARE PACK ANIMALS THAT THRIVE ON COMPANIONSHIP. Much like their wolf ancestors, dogs are very social. In fact, dogs are more social than humans and need to be part of human families. When you own a dog, you become the dog’s pack and he wants to be with his pack. Forcing a dog to live outside with little or no human companionship is one of the most psychologically damaging things a pet owner can do to a dog.  DOGS ARE ALSO DEN ANIMALS. This means that they like to have a safe, quiet, and secure place to sleep, rest, and hang out, such as your house. Your dog has a wonderful ability to learn and therefore to be housetrained. A dog who resides more in your house than in the yard is a much happier animal, because of the security of a den and your companionship.  BACKYARD DOGS HAVE MORE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. Since all your dog’s instincts are telling him it is not good to be left alone or isolated from his pack, your dog can become very stressed or anxious. A dog exhibits stress by digging, barking, howling or whining, chewing, escaping, and exhibiting hyperactivity. These problems can become so troublesome that your neighbors may complain about the barking, howling, property destruction, or your dog escaping.  BACKYARD DOGS ARE HARDER TO TRAIN. Considering that the backyard dog does not develop a strong bond towards your family, he is harder to train than a dog allowed to be in the house with your family. This also makes him less responsive to commands.  BACKYARD DOGS MAKE LOUSY GUARD DOGS. As a dog becomes naturally protective of where he lives (his territory or turf), he will only defend the place he lives in. If he is never allowed in the house, then the house will not become a place to protect. Most people keep their valuables inside their houses, so why wouldn’t you want your dog to protect the inside of your house? Unless allowed to live inside, your dog will not develop that sense of territory. He will not sound the alarm when someone tries to invade your house. It is not uncommon to hear stories of families being robbed while their backyard dog slept through the whole episode.  BACKYARD DOGS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF EUTHANASIA. Backyard dogs are more often given up than house dogs because they were never looked upon as family by their human pack. Sadly, that means they are easier to dispose of. Backyard dogs do not have the opportunity to become socialized to people and other dogs, and may become so fearful or even vicious that they may have to be euthanized.   WHAT YOU CAN DO:  KEEP YOUR DOG WITH YOU! At a minimum, your dog should have access to your living space whenever you are home, including sleeping inside your house at night. You do not have to spend every waking moment actively playing and talking to your dog; just the fact that your dog can lay quietly at your feet while you watch TV, work at your computer or sleep, is very important to his mental well-being.  NEVER TIE OR CHAIN YOUR DOG UP OUTSIDE. Dogs that are tied up or chained outside suffer extreme frustration, which can result in hyperactivity and/or aggression against humans. Dogs that are tied up cannot escape from other animals or people who mean to do them harm. They can also easily become entangled and do bodily harm to themselves. In fact, in California, there are laws against tethering your dog!  THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME YOU’LL DEVOTE TO YOUR DOG. People who keep their dogs outside constantly rationalize it. They insist that they do spend time with their dogs, they do feed them, and walk them. Spending an hour a day with your dog is not enough for his mental welfare. Be realistic! What about when it is rainy, windy, cold, or just plain too hot? Are you still spending that hour daily with your dog no matter what? Making the backyard your dog’s only home does not make him a real part of the family.  DO YOU FIT THE STATISTICS? Our lives have changed. It used to be that most people did spend a lot of time in the yard; playing, working, gardening, and socializing. Now with the age of computers, televisions, and hectic schedules, we actually spend about 75% less time outdoors in our yards, and therefore less time with our devoted friend, the dog.  TRAIN YOUR DOG! If your dog is untrained, take him to training class so you can develop better communication skills with him, and teach him how to act appropriately in the house. If you have a young puppy, get him into a puppy training and socialization class as soon as he turns 12 weeks old. Don’t wait until he is six months old and has already acquired a taste for tipping over the garbage can or chewing on your rug. If you acquire an older dog, training him as soon as possible will help him adjust to his new household and your family (his new pack). To learn more about training programs at the Animal Community Center, visit www.hssv.org/training.  GIVE YOUR DOG A CHANCE TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND! Don’t kick him out because you think he is untrainable, unruly, or because you think it’s “good for him to be outside.” Instead, take the time to make him a part of your family and a part of your pack. dog_backyard.pdf Rev. 1-11    Copyright © Humane Society Silicon Valley.

Get 3 months expenses in an high-interest savings account at your local bank or credit union as **[an emergency fund](http://www.wisebread.com/figuring-the-size-of-your-emergency-fund)**.  Eventually get this up to 6 months expenses.  * 2. Contribute to your company 401K up to the company match.  Please read the **[Long-Term Investing Start-Up Kit](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investing_start-up_kit)** in the sidebar. You should generally prefer low-cost index funds.  * 3. Contribute to a Roth IRA up to the yearly contribution limit (currently $5500). If your company offers no match for a 401K, contribute here first instead. Most folks here will recommend Vanguard.  * 4. If you have extra money to save, you can then attempt to max out your 401K.  Unrelated, but when you next buy a car (if applicable), set a maximum cost limit with **The 20/4/10 Rule**   * Put a minimum of **20**% down on the total price of the car (negotiated price + sales tax)  * Never take a loan out greater than a **4** year term  * (Monthly payment + insurance + maintenance) should be less than **10**% of your gross monthly income.

Our new pope is cool and all but I think you would be the best pope.  11. I'm settling on Zero/Dante/Strange as my team, with Bolts and sometimes with Daggers of Denak against certain matchups. Is this team Viscant Approved™?  12. I feel like you would know the secret of the universe. What is it?  13. What's Galactus's best and worst matchups?  14.

There are people who *actively resist* allowing their children to be prevented from deadly illness, increasing the risks for *everyone around them* in the process. It's evil. Yes, I said *evil* and I *meant* **evil**. As it stands it borders on child abuse, and if these people implemented their stupidity on a large enough scale it would amount to no less than crimes against humanity. The lives of millions of people are saved *each year* thanks to vaccinations.  You are obviously free to think about anything you want. It's stupid though to refuse to accept something that has such mountains of evidence supporting it. The accepted standard is that vaccines are good. If you want to spend time trying to prove that wrong, go right ahead. We could use more medical research anyway. Until you do that though you have no reason to reject the current models.

By soaking everyday objects in solutions containing silica, otherwise known as sand, researchers have long been able to make fossils in a matter of months. That may seem counterintuitive, but even natural fossilization must begin within that time frame.  ""The organic material must be stabilized within weeks to months, otherwise it decays,"" says Derek Briggs, a palaeontologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  The silica permeates the organic material and hardens early in the process. This creates a structure that survives after the organic material rots away. By creating fossils in the lab, Briggs says, researchers can learn how the process alters organic matter, and where fossils might be found around the world.  Hot stuff  “This is a highly porous, very strong material” Shin accelerated the fossilization process by warming things up. He soaked wood in acid for two days, and in water and silica for another two. Then he fired the wood blocks in a furnace at 1,400 °C. The extreme temperatures bonded the silicon in the sand to the carbon in the wood, creating a silicon carbide 'fossil'. The work is published in Advanced Materials1.  Technically, the wood is not really fossilized, says Briggs, because silicon and carbon never bond in normal fossilization. ""I don't think this reaction happens in nature,"" he says. But, fossil or not, the wood makes an excellent sponge, according to Shin.  ""This is a highly porous, very strong material,"" he says. Shin hopes that the wood might someday be used at the nearby Hanford Nuclear Reservation, where underground storage tanks hold some 200 million litres of radioactive material, some of which is boiling from the heat of radioactive decay.  If the pores in the wood could be made smaller and more regular, Shin believes that it could be used to sop up the boiling sludge, which is too hot to be handled by conventional clean-up techniques.  Shin thinks the wood has other properties that might make it useful. The silicon carbide structure can withstand temperatures of up to 1,500 °C. And it is very tough, something one laboratory assistant learned the hard way. ""He broke two diamond blades trying to cut it,"" Shin says. ",©

t5_2s599,uncomfortably,1376115283,"I think a lot of this has to do with how/what mewtwo uses to attack first. If he: - attempts to hijack the minds of the xmen, he will loose.  Jean Grey will resist heavily, while also trying to get inside the pokemons mind. While he is occupied (I'm assuming jean grey and mewtwo are evenly matched psionically) wolverine cuts his head off.  - throws things at them telekinetically: he looses. They Xmen are too agile, and he will either not prepare for a blast from cyclops, a charging beast, or an attacking wolverine. Not to mention jean grey would counter (or at least slow) these attacks.  - captures/pins them with telekinesis: this would give the Pokemon the best shot. He has shown the ability to  subdue Pokemon alot stronger/larger than the combined mass and strength of the xmen. This would then lead to a psychic battle between Jean Grey and Mewtwo, which I could see going 50/50. They have the most raw psionic power in their respective universes, and neither of them have found their limits.   Good battle OP. 👍",👍

Affecting anyone using the internet it is much much more than just in America, the surveillance is _everywhere_. Even if the US manages to abolish it's entire government, the train will still keep on going elsewhere.  Obviously going much deeper than just the internet, surveillance of such magnitude should be held in front of a trial citizens trial; more realistically the UN.  In order for this to recess it would require a complete change of government, including the very structure of today's governments. Let's say we could a much more direct democracy, no wars, no government as a corporation, but as a small entity made _by_ and _for_ the _people_. I must be kidding myself, because I understand it's not plausible, and will never happen in my life time.   Considering the governments most of us are familiar with, have been operating like this since the early 50s... I think the chances are slim to none for _real_ change. So...   Where do we go from here? As long as these greedy bankers (and wall street), insane police, and corrupt politicians are running the world there's not a _damn_ thing we can do about it.  Think about it, is our reality much different from that of the 60s?   The majority wants legal Cannabis, mostly everyone is against the Wa®, psychedelics are becoming increasingly popular (causes a shift in consciousness). Instead we have a war on drugs which is really a war on **consciousness** itself.  In my opinion history is repeating itself, and we're strangely close to a cold war situation.

t5_2cneq,Miserygut,1376137076,"I was thinking about the best way of handling this and it's the only logical solution.

t5_2qs0q,Legolas-the-elf,1376137115,"Computers don't deal with text, they deal with numbers.  Text in a computer is represented by a number.  There are lots of different ways of mapping characters to numbers.  This is known as a character encoding.  For instance, ASCII maps the character `A` to the number `65`.  When a computer reads data and it decodes the data as ASCII text, if it comes across the number `65`, it will display the character `A`.  Unicode is like that, except it is far larger - it attempts to handle all languages known to man, along with a few extras, like symbols.  Given that there are hundreds of thousands of characters, it's not feasible to have a keyboard with all of these characters on.  For convenience, a lot of systems let you enter characters using a numeric representation.  In HTML, this is with numeric character references.  When you see `&amp;128147;`, what is happening is that you are indicating to the HTML parser that it should insert a character with the Unicode code point `128147` into the stream, as if it had encountered that number directly.  It's just like you typed that character in as far as HTML is concerned.  For instance, writing `&lt;p&gt;HA!&lt;/p&gt;` and `&lt;p&gt;H&amp;65;!&lt;/p&gt;` are equivalent (the code points in ASCII and Unicode are the same for all the characters represented by ASCII).  It's typical for Unicode characters to be referenced in hexadecimal rather than decimal.  `128147` in decimal is `0x1F493` in hexadecimal.  You can also use this representation in HTML by prefixing it with an `x`, for example `&amp;#x1f493`.  If you look this character up in [the Unicode charts](http://www.unicode.org/charts/), you'll see that it appears in [Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf) as `💓 BEATING HEART`.  One important distinction you should be aware of is between a *character encoding* and a *character set*.  A character set is a numbered collection of characters.  A character encoding is a representation in data.  Because there are so many characters in Unicode, the numbers go too high to be represented in a single byte.  However most of the Western world mostly only uses characters that fit within the first byte, so it would be wasteful to dedicate two or four bytes to encoding text.  So Unicode, as well as defining UCS (the Universal Character Set), also defines several character encodings that are more efficient.  UTF-8 is the most popular on the web.  As far as HTML is concerned, every document uses UCS, and when you use a numeric character reference, you are referring to its code point within UCS.  However when HTML documents are serialised, they can be encoded in a variety of encodings.  So you would typically save your files and encode your strings as UTF-8, but if you refer to particular characters in code, you would usually refer to them by UCS code point.",💓

From there the user can rapidly and silently move to low, then strobe, with just a slight press of the switch.  Lol'd at this one. This is how every cheap chinese flashlight operates, it's called mode selection. This isn't high-tech, it's the most common feature on budget flashlights and most definitely not something to be proud of.  &gt;The switch has six chips to perform these functions  That's amazing! Nothing turns me on more than 6 chips in a switch.   &gt;The MH (Momentary Hi) switch is the classic manual Tactical Touch® switch preferred by many officers and operators.

t5_2tex6,kqr,1376144694,"https://gist.github.com/kqr/6200607  That's the gist (hehe) of it. It's really rudimentary at the time (it's a five-minute hack from a few years ago.) You create a bookmark by pressing Ctrl+S and entering space-separated tags. You open a bookmark by pressing Ctrl+T and starting to type the URL or tags associated with the page.  To access reddit i just press Ctrl+T, type ""red"" and press return – it finds the right bookmark based on the URL. To access e.g. [this article related to functional reactive programming](http://conal.net/fran/tutorial.htm)  I saved ages ago (picked it randomly from my bookmarks list as an example) I type ""frp"" and press return – it finds the right bookmark based on the tags I have given it. It's like an opt-in, taggable history.  Things I would eventually like to do to improve the system:   1. Give priority to bookmarks I visit often and created recently. This is probably also one of the most complicated fixes and I haven't given it much thought. I would like to make it happen some rainy day. Many of my bookmarks are just things I save to look at the next day or whatever, so I want those to bubble down to the bottom of the list as I never access them again, yet I want them to appear at the top when I created them recently.   2. Allow retagging of bookmarks. A fairly simple fix that would mean a world of difference. I currently retag by editing them manually in Vim...   3. Deleting bookmarks. Not that I would need this with priority given to frequently visited bookmarks, but it's a feature that sounds too obvious not to have.   4. Non-local storage of bookmarks. A friend has made a small adaption to my system to allow him to have his bookmarks centralised on a server. It apparently works really well for him, but it's not something I need so I haven't cared much for it.  One benefit of this system is that it's stupid simple. If you have a set-up with dmenu and surf, you already have all the pieces you need. Everything Just Works™. There's no database involved, there's no external program processing the bookmarks, there's nothing but dmenu, xprop and a text file.  Of course, one can imagine an even better (and slightly more complicated) system. It would be awesome if one could avoid the whole manual tagging process if one wanted to, and make it automatically assign some sort of tags based on what the page seems to be about, but then we're moving into Google-search-engine stuff I'm not near smart enough to create.  ----  Edit: I realise now your post might have been a funny joke and it went completely over my head. Oh well, now it's out there!",™

It'll look something like:  `&lt;div id=""primary"" class=""content-area""&gt;` 		&lt;div id=""content"" class=""site-content"" role=""main""&gt;  			&lt;?php /* The loop */ ?&gt; 			&lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;  				&lt;article id=""post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;"" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt; 					&lt;header class=""entry-header""&gt; 						&lt;?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() &amp;&amp; ! post_password_required() ) : ?&gt; 						&lt;div class=""entry-thumbnail""&gt; 							&lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt; 						&lt;/div&gt; 						&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;  						&lt;h1 class=""entry-title""&gt;&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; 					&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  					&lt;div class=""entry-content""&gt; 						&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt; 						&lt;?php wp_link_pages( array( 'before' =&gt; '&lt;div class=""page-links""&gt;&lt;span class=""page-links-title""&gt;' . __( 'Pages:', 'twentythirteen' ) . '&lt;/span&gt;', 'after' =&gt; '&lt;/div&gt;', 'link_before' =&gt; '&lt;span&gt;', 'link_after' =&gt; '&lt;/span&gt;' ) ); ?&gt; 					&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  					&lt;footer class=""entry-meta""&gt; 						&lt;?php edit_post_link( __( 'Edit', 'twentythirteen' ), '&lt;span class=""edit-link""&gt;', '&lt;/span&gt;' ); ?&gt; 					&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-meta --&gt; 				&lt;/article&gt;&lt;!-- #post --&gt;  				&lt;?php comments_template(); ?&gt; 			&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;  		&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #content --&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #primary --&gt;`  Up there is where you'll also want to do whatever custom code/thing you were going to do.  Obviously that's copy/pasted from the twentythirteen theme as an example. Lastly add your sidebar and footer  `&lt;?php get_sidebar(); ?&gt;`  `&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;`  That's how you create a template in Wordpress, the last step is to go to a page and select this template.

A word of caution needs to  accompany them. In the AD&amp;D® game, when a character is very charismatic, he gets what is called  a ""reaction adjustment."" (See the Player's Handbook, page 18.) When the character  has a high Charisma and receives a bonus, it's expressed as a plus: +2, for instance.  When he has a low Charisma and receives a penalty, it's expressed as a minus: –3, for  example.  However, when you roll the 2d10 for encounter reactions (see the Encounter  Reactions Table, Dungeon Master's Guide) p. 103, don't add the bonus (+) or  subtract the penalty (–) from the die roll. Do it the other way around. If the character  has a Charisma of 16, and thus gets a +5 reaction adjustment, you subtract that  number from the 2d10 die roll. (Otherwise the NPCs would be reacting even more  badly because the character was charismatic!)""",®

""One multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing load-distributing band CPR (AutoPulse®) with manual CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrated no improvement in 4-hour survival and worse neurologic outcome when the device was used. Further studies are required to determine if site-specific factors and experience with deployment of the device could influence its efficacy. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of this device. Case series employing mechanical piston devices have reported variable degrees of success. Such devices may be considered for use when conventional CPR would be difficult to maintain (eg, during diagnostic studies). To prevent delays and maximize efficiency, initial training, ongoing monitoring, and retraining programs should be offered on a frequent basis to providers using CPR devices.""",®

t5_2rdbn,0perator00,1376176174,"The first piece for this thing was ordered August 12, 2010. Since around then (regarding the internals of the PC) I've added only the additional two video cards, sound card, and one of the 1 TB hard drives. Also replaced the PSU (old 1000W one failed.)   Originally I was using a HP ZR22w on each side, however 1080p in portrait mode isn't wide enough for me so I switched to the HP ZR24w which are 1920x1200. I love the ZR30w as a center and will never go back to 1080p, 2560x1600 is amazing.   I will be building risers for my speakers (long overdue.)   I have two ASUS GeForce GTX Titans on order, I could live with less, but obviously that's not the theme here.   After that the next consideration will be a PCI express SSD, this one is 3 years old and seems to be slowing down.   I have two keyboards because I recently purchased the TECK and having a hard time adjusting to it.    The bottom ""easy mount"" wall plate is shit, and I will likely be replacing it with the same plate as the top.   I work for an ISP, from home.

t5_2qhe8,IWantToBeNormal,1376185854,"I can sort of agree with this.  Since no one wants me to work, thus forcing me to rely on cash disability payments to afford housing and make choices between food and my contacts/hearing aid batteries and a cell phone upon which I could receive calls for potential job interviews, why should my opinion count at the polls since I'm not working and paying into social security?  It only makes sense for me to Take The Hint™ from the rest of society, stay home, and not vote or participate in any community changes or activities simply because I am a stupid little one-eyed retard.  If everyone else has to work and pay into social security in order for me to stay home and eat peanut butter (since I'm not even good enough for pizza because I am a retard), then I shouldn't have any say whatsoever in political proceedings.  Maybe if only someone would look past appearances for a second?  And give me a chance to showcase my true abilities and industriousness in a job?  Then maybe I could be persuaded to get out and cast my vote like any normal-class citizen.  But until then, I guess for as long as people mock my vision loss by pretending to not see my applications and mock my hearing loss by ignoring my follow-up calls, I'll just abstain from any community legislation that could possibly take away funds from the normal healthy beautiful people who truly deserves them.  Also I see no ""underlying threat of violence"".  Discrimination and hate against us disables doesn't work that way; they are often masked as depraved indifference masked as apologetic kindness:  ""Oh, I'm sorry, I **would** help you out a little but, heh,"" *shrugs*, ""my hands're tied, sorreh!""  If they were to be posted, it would only be for informational purposes so that people who are in a position to provide opportunity for the less fortunate to sustain themselves can have a guide to filter out any potential deadweight.  For example, an owner of a chain of grocery stores could add those names to his e-mail's auto-filter so those sixteen people can submit online applications for supplemental part-time work all the livelong day and they would just get routed to the trash while he interviews and hires healthy, physically-abled ex-cons for full-time positions.  There's lots of other subtle underhanded ways that posting names of the disabled could be used against them but violence is definitely less of a fear factor than, say, identity theft.

t5_2rbsy,dustymcmusty,1376194172,"Great question! It does cost about $5k to become a real estate agent, and we do pay anywhere from $250 - $1000/month as a 'desk fee' to our Brokerage and VREB. When a sale completes the Brokerage also takes a percentage of our commission. Not to mention maintaing in-depth knowledge of the local market &amp; other startup and marketing costs. So you certainly gotta be doing some business if you're paying those monthly brokerage fees.  I believe that consumers are more informed than ever, and demand high quality low cost real estate services. Many REALTORS® vehemently resist the fact that the Internet has changed their industry forever, much like how the Internet has revolutionized the travel, financial services, and print media industries.

But why can't we try to find the source of the problem and treat that instead of treating the symptom. The point of the comment was to say that we do over medicate. Yes, some medicines are needed and wonderful that we have discovered it. But other times, we treat a symptom and then end up having to treat more symptoms that developed from the first medication.

t5_2qhp5,duckstampede,1376199838,&gt;  GotVapes VISION eGo Stardust ™ 1.6ml  That is a good starter. Your next step is going to be figuring out if you like more flavor or a stronger throat hit which will help to determine your next tank. I like a smoother more flavorful vape (I have a sensitive throat I guess) but my DH likes a stronger throat hit.  I think you have about 3-5 more days before you realize how much things actually do smell both good and bad lol. I had no idea my dogs needed baths so often or that my (previously) favorite perfume was so god damn strong lol.,™

t5_2vadq,headlessparrot,1376237392,"Home visiting my parents. My dad and I don’t exactly see eye-to-eye when it comes to whisky: he likes the light and smooth (and the flavoured). I tend to prefer the more intense (the Laphroaig I left behind last year hasn’t been touched). But on the other hand, checking his cabinet when I get home always gives me the chance to try a couple things I might not have otherwise invested in.  Like Crown Royal Maple. Which I’m not exactly looking forward to. But, for science! I had some not-kind things to say about Jack Daniels Honey, but there are reasons for some tentative optimism here: higher ABV, the fact that I prefer the taste of maple syrup to the taste of honey anyway, the fact that (allegedly) the addition of the maple is done in a slightly more subtle way (with the addition of “maple toasted oak staves,” whatever that phrase means, to barrels—rather than just adding some syrup). On the other hand. . . . Yeah, I still think this isn’t going to go well.  **Crown Royal Maple Finished Canadian Whisky**; NAS; 40% ABV; 750mL; retails for about $29 Cdn. in the province of Alberta.  **Appearance:** e150a. Without a doubt. Decent legs, but that’s no doubt attributable to the added sugar. Crown Royal has nice branding, though. So there’s that.  **Nose:** Umm... Yeah. Sweet. Maple syrup. But like a mix of real maple syrup and that fake store-brand “maple-flavoured” pancake syrup (more of the latter than the former, though). Maybe a bit of caramel, vanilla. A toasted woody character. Taffy? Toffee. Dusty gravel road. Hard water. But mostly maple. Very little of the Crown Royal character (bourbon-lite™, as I like to call it) comes through.  **Taste:** A bit more of the Crown Royal profile comes through here, but it’s still mostly maple. Interestingly thin, despite the sticky sugariness. Smooth, if nothing else. A bit less over-the-top sweet than I was expecting, but don’t get me wrong it’s still very, very sweet. Some tingling heat, which at least acknowledges you’re drinking an actual spirit. Vanilla, caramel. A slightly more authentic maple-syrup taste than the smell would suggest.  **Finish:** There and gone. Sweet, maple, toasted wood. More elusive hints of the base (actual whisky!) spirit (hey, some corn!).  **Final Thoughts:** Again, yeah. This stuff obviously isn’t intended for me, or for whisky nerds in general. It seems to me to be better made than Jack Daniels Honey (fewer distinctly off-notes, doesn’t have that bile-ish quality I got from the JD), but it’s very sweet, very one-note, and very not whisky-like (although I actually think a whisky-maker could do something interesting with maple if they upped the whisky’s rye content, to play on the spicy-sweet potential). Smooth, though, and it doesn’t really offend me. It wouldn’t be my first choice (or my second, or my third, or my . . . etc., etc.,), but I could drink it without wincing (although, again, I do like me some maple syrup). And if it attracts people to *actual* whisky, that’s cool too, I guess. My dad likes it. More power to him.  **Score:** 69 ",™

They are basically a form of velcro, where both pieces attach to the wall/object using Command's safe, removable adhesive.  I use them to attach everything on my apartment walls. A while back I realized that all the old vinyl albums I owned were just taking up space, but I didn't want to get rid of them for nostalgic reasons. So I actually did a literal album art mosaic similar to the iTunes album art screen saver.  With the vinyl still in the sleeves, I used the adhesive strips to attache 30 albums to the wall in a 6x5 grid in my dining area. They have held up perfectly, and I've swapped a couple around since I first put them up, with no damage to the wall or album covers. (Even the three LP Live at Woodstock has held up fine.)  Should work just as well for you mosaic, and I think it will look great with no border or extra material detracting from the LEGO of it all.

However, using with distilled or deionized water will accomplish some scale removal in the cylinder head area. Plain water with or without WaterWetter® should not be used in cooling systems containing magnesium - antifreeze should be used - with WaterWetter®.

t5_2t5iz,Ice_Cream_Bunny,1376259849,"Benedict's tan, sinewy fingers practically quivered with lusty anticipation as he pried at the cellophane wrapper. He had not felt such a primal connection to a piece of productivity software in years, not since his ignominious betrayal at the hands of one dBase III. When he had entered the software section of his local CompUSA on a whim a mere thirty minutes ago, perhaps for old times' sake, a vision in sky blue caught his eye, boldly intoning ""Office Standard (Designed for Windows^® 95),"" front and center, as if issuing a challenge to the rippled Adonis that stood before it. There was something about the way the four puzzle pieces on the cover intertwined -- Word! Excel! PowerPoint! Schedule+! -- yes, they formed a perfectly coherent and beautiful whole, yet somehow they beckoned Benedict to come inside and join them.   Now Benedict was in his modest yet elegant split-level home, his Gateway 2000 Pentium PC primed and ready, his enormous member threatening to break free of his well-fitted jeans. He opened the box with as much passionate energy as he could muster, at least without damaging the packaging and therefore obviating the possibility of a return. Never mind the warranty, never mind the instruction manual -- as soon as Benedict espied the iridescent twinkle of Office 95 CD-ROM 1, he had to resist the urge to penetrate the disc immediately, for his member was simply too enormous and he was loath to damage the software contained within before he had installed it to the hard disk drive. Instead, he ripped his shirt off, exposing a dazzling array of sweat-soaked abs and rippling biceps, bookended by a virile jaw and two very nice feet *[ed: what are people looking for in a dude's feet?]*. Michelangelo could not have envisioned a more spectacular body in the most pristine Carrara marble, or even with Microsoft Office's convenient built-in drawing tools.  Benedict tenderly switched on the power to his machine, emitting an amorous groan as he did so. The hard disk drive's motor clicked and roared to life like a pride of lions in the Sahara; Benedict's 17-inch monitor, comparable in size to his enormous member, coruscated in 24 brilliant bits of true color; and Windows 95 booted up like Benedict had never seen it boot up before. Perhaps the operating system somehow knew of what was to take place as Benedict lowered his pants and exposed his fully engorged member, down which droplets of Cowper's fluid were already cascading in an exquisite spiral all the way down past his lustrous sack and into his firm gluteal cleft.   Benedict ardently pressed the ""eject"" button that adorned the beige front bezel of his quad-speed Toshiba CD-ROM drive -- click, whirrrr. And Benedict held his Office 95 CD-ROM 1 by the edges, kissed it fervidly right on the spindle hole, and lowered it, shiny side down, into the tray. He pushed the tray back into its receptacle, able to wait no longer. That prophetic nine-character phrase -- SETUP.EXE. Click, click.  The setup program erupted on Benedict's monitor in a Mediterranean blue. ""Tell me, Benedict, you heavenly beacon of masculinity, what is your full name? You may also enter the name of your organization. Setup will use this information for --""  ""*Enough!* Oh, Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Setup, my name is Benedict Longjohnson; the only organization I claim to belong to is that of holy matrimony between the two of us, and by God, we shall consummate this bond! OK!""  ""Confirm that the information you entered is correct.""  ""Oh, God, it could not be more correct!"" Benedict, realizing that the computer lacked an organ with which to manipulate his organ, redirected his left hand to his enormous member and began to stroke violently, occasionally sending spurts of Cowper's fluid right at the monitor. ""OK!!""  ""My dearest Benedict, it would gratify me so if you located your 10-digit 'CD Key' number and entered it in the space below. Yes, right there. Mmmmff.""  Benedict had memorized the number on the sticker on the back of his CD case long before. ""425,"" he typed furiously, ""1921701! OK!"" He would have written down his Microsoft product identification number in the designated portion of his registration card, but both of his hands were quite occupied at the moment, one with the installation and the other with the onanism of his gargantuan schlong, and he would have plenty of time to access the number by clicking the About... command on the Help menu after the deed was done.  Setup searched for installed components. ""You need not worry,"" assured Benedict; ""my computer is unsullied with the remnants of some previous lover. You are mine, and I am yours, forever."" The noise of his well-oiled hand sliding up and down his great big weiner intensified. He chose to install Microsoft Office Professional in the default folder of C:\MSOffice. ""OK, Microsoft Office Professional 95 Setup! Catapult me to paradise! Typical installation! Yes, install all the Microsoft Data Maps you can muster!""

Each time there is a lot of planning and planning and replanning and discussions, not a single line is coded because everything is in planning, and three months later the forums are devoid of life and there are no developers left.   Another thing that bothers me is when a team (I'm thinking about several mod projects) decides to only do a release when it is done. A year later all their forums are empty, the dev teams twiddle (people leave, get hit by buses, etc), and it seems like all that effort has been wasted.   I referenced spout because they seemed to struck the right balance. They did some initial planning and design, but they also got started right away and had public builds immediately. Due to the miracle of git branching they have been able to simultaneously work on new features, replace place holders, and go back and even redo elements that were badly designed or someone learned a better way to do things. Their developer community is lively and very strong, even a year later, with new devs coming in even as some of the old ones move on.  Planning is important, but this isn't like a dev house where people are invested in continuing the planning phase by a paycheck. Its a community of volunteers who are only invested by their interests. Something tangible has to come out soon™ to keep the community, both dev and end user, alive.

The kicker is he has to insert it into his urethra every time.   3am rolls around and I scream across the room to my roommate ""HOLY SHIT BRO YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PENAR™ RIGHT NOW"" and he screams ""OH GOD"" and sprints into the bathroom and starts yelling at the top of his lungs for like 15 minutes.

t5_2qky2,toinfinitiandbeyond,1376270627,"There is a difference between being ""charitable"" and being a ""pawn"".  The LDS church is a multi-billion dollar corporation who for at least the last 25 years has slowly taken away most of the benefits of being a church member.  Back in 1998 my wife and I were the ""Ward Activity Planners"" that's great, we were super excited until we saw the budget.  $125 to feed over 300 people!    ""God®"" provided the way.  Unfortunately it was out of our own checkbook.  It was a Great ward party!  It cost us a sum that the Bishop wouldn't cover.  That may have been part of the reason I started questioning the church.     When I was a kid the church used to have ""roadshows"" and they would sponsor other activities to promote membership.  Currently they sponsor nothing.  I see Mormon children going from door to door trying to sell corporate backed crap so they can get pennies on the dollar to enjoy what I used to have for FREE.    The Church spent more on City Creek than every missionary who has ever served.  The mall cost more than all the Fast Offerings in the past 35 years.  Am I bitter?  You bet I am.  &gt;Dude, the whole goal of the church is service and being charitable, instead of selfish and self-serving. Why is that a bad thing?  Yes, if it serves a corporate interest, I would say yes it is a bad thing.

If Snowden is a bad guy for giving some Powerpoint slides to a civil rights reporter, what the hell does that make our government?   But no, we aren't supposed to think such traitorous thoughts.

I'm confident that in the coming years, as the world gets hotter and capitalism continues to self-destruct and automation gives us enough free time to realize that maybe, just maybe, people are capable of more than flipping patties on a grill and shooting each other in the face, we will see a radical reconfiguration of society.

t5_2t2fz,Spinyofdoom,1376293821,"What kind of keyboard do you have? If it's a non-gaming one, chances are the problems you're experiencing are related to ghosting, which is basically when a keyboard can't handle more than X buttons being pressed at once, and ignores, or 'ghosts' some of the extra keypresses. As you can imagine, this is somewhat of a problem, especially for fighting games. Most higher-end keyboards are built specifically to prevent ghosting, but if you're using a low-to-midrange one that could be the issue.   An easy way to check this would be to go into training mode, turn on 'Input Display: List' in training options, and try to execute a move, say, Valentine's Dead Cross (↓↘→P). If the input shows up on your screen as something like this (→P), this  (↓P) or this (↓↘→), that means your keyboard is ghosting out some of the presses and screwing you over.     If ghosting is not the problem, then I'm not entirely sure how to help you, sorry :/. The best advice I can give you is to make sure you're releasing whatever keys you have for movement fully before hitting your attack keys.    (Also, regarding Ultimate Showstopper, if it makes you feel better I probably hit it around 1/10 tries with a stick when I do play ~~Tits McGrapple~~ Cerebella. Seriously fuck that thing).",↘

The Blizzard Soon™ is only funny when it's not a grim reality *for everything*. If the devs or social media interns reach out to the community, they can't offer any details about upcoming updates or how they're listening to feedback because... well... I don't know why but it probably has something to do with how they're choosing to run the show.  The biggest problem anyone on the D3 dev team has to face is that when they want to work on updates, they are being paid to rework content rather than create new (expansions, console ports.. etc).

t5_2qxih,Solaufein,1376311974,"&gt; With that said, you are comparing two different F2P models that I don't think fits into your argument.  Of course it does. TSW has an excellent F2P model. SWTOR has a rubbish one. They *are* different and it *does* fit my argument.  &gt; one allows you to play with limited features to gain interest  TSW has a ""buddy key"" feature that allows players to trial the game for 24 hours. The keys are extremely easy to find on the internet and a two-day trial is a great way to work out whether or not it's worth spending $30 on the game.  &gt; One model all game abilities become unlocked when you sub, the other requires you to buy items with real world cash to get the best gear.  lolwut  The Secret World has NO buy-to-win elements, because all gear is available to ANY player. Funcom made sure that gear and clothing were two entirely different things, so that the only stuff one can purchase with real-world money is clothing/cosmetic items.  &gt; One model rewards subscribers with benefits that Preferred or F2P players dont get  It doesn't reward subscribers. You must be new to the game, because we already got this stuff *before* F2P came in. Subscribers have received no benefit from the F2P system. Population numbers are up, sure, but now we have under-geared F2Pers ruining end-game PvP and PvE PUGs with their rubbish gear.  &gt; while the other gives you discounts off spending money at the store.  &gt; (From TSW site) Unique Membership-only item which increases experience gain for defeating monster by 100% for 1 hour each day $10 worth of Bonus Points (given out every month)* Membership Item-of-the-month gift (given out every month) 10% discount to everything in the Item Store  All of those things you've listed were introduced post-F2P. That means, subscribers are now getting *more* for the same price. They are being *rewarded* for their ongoing support. As I pointed out above, SWTOR **does not do this**.  &gt; This also gives you....  &gt; Full chat.  Uh, nope. Even Preferred Status players have a time limit on how often they can post in General Chat. After each post they have to wait for 30 seconds before they can reply, which makes communicating on large planets difficult.  &gt; Access to mail and ability to send attachments.  rofl  ONE attachment at a time. Preferred Status players still **cannot move credits between their characters**.  &gt; Can trade with other players. Sell up to 5 items at a time on the Trade Network. Get access to 2 craft skills. (Subbs get access to 3) Can create 6 characters Regular Price on vendor items  You've listed these things like they are some exciting new feature that F2Pers gain access to when they spend money on the game. They're not. These are *basic* features that the majority of SWTOR's F2P rivals provide for free.  &gt; Hey not bad for only 5$ dollars in game.  rofl  &gt; So I think its cute how you want to bash on a game you clearly love to hate, and don't fully understand the model.  At least I played the game for a year before I passed comment on the model. You haven't even played TSW and you're trying to tell me it's model is inferior to SWTOR's. I mean:  ""the other requires you to buy items with real world cash to get the best gear.""  Did you even bother to read about TSW before you started accusing it of being P2W?  &gt; Going by the Revenue numbers, although you may not like it, may think its a joke, may think its ""cute"", or less superior, SWTOR is sure kicking the hell out of the subscriber numbers and revenue of The Secret World. (Oh and in case you want to argue, TSW's only published sale base (units) numbers is around 120,000 vs. 2,600,000 for SWTOR. OH GW2 1,700,000 units.)  SURPRISE! A Star Wars™ (one of the most successful franchises ever) MMO aimed at teenagers and developed by one of the best-known RPG developers in the world (BioWare) is making more money than an adult survival-horror MMO filled with obscure references to 19th century literature that is not part of any franchise.  Of course SWTOR is more successful. It was always going to be. You only have to read some of the in-game character names to figure it out; SWTOR's player base is made up of little kids who want to play ""Jedi"". The fact that it has made more money does not prove that it's F2P system is better. It is making money *despite* it's F2P system, not because of it.",™
t5_2qh13,redvolunteer,1376312661,"&gt;The Irish economy is bouncing back  Bouncing back? I don't know what economic data you're looking at, but a more appropriate description would be that Ireland is like a recently over-dosed heroin addict whose liver, kidneys and brain have just started to stabilise, but remains in a very precarious position.  &gt;Youth unemployment has dropped from 30% to 25%  But why? Because tens of thousands of us, myself included, have emigrated. If we didn't speak English, we'd be in exactly the same position as our peers in Spain or Greece. [87,000 people  left the country last year, with a net migration of -37,000.](http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2012/popmig_2012.pdf). We're still at unemployment levels about 240% higher than 2008.  &gt;Also I think that due to our relatively high gdp for a low population, it makes it easier for us to look after the unemployed  We collected [€36.65bn](http://www.publicpolicy.ie/wp-content/uploads/Fiscal-Table1.2.jpg) in tax revenues, current expenditure was [€52.14bn](http://www.publicpolicy.ie/wp-content/uploads/Fiscal-Table-1.41.jpg) and to top it all off, about 50% of all VAT collected, or 1/3 of all Income Tax is used to pay the bastard *interest* on State Debt¹.  We're borrowing huge amounts of money on a daily basis to simply keep the country ticking along. Lump on top of that a tranche of debt that *shouldn't* be our problem, only for the gobshites in Governemnt unconditionally guaranteeing **all** bank debt; and you've got a situation where we're gradually being given piece by piece, all the rope we need to hang ourselves. We're not able to look after our unemployed; and the moment the nice vultures on Wall St. stop buying our bonds and the IMF decides it's Harsh Austerity Time™, we're fucked.  &gt;we're well educated and work our arses off  That's debatable.  &gt;How else could we afford so much alcohol? It's so god damn expensive here!  Paying €5 for pinteen is only for the tourists. ;)  *****************  ¹ Calculated from taxation figures from [here](http://www.publicpolicy.ie/wp-content/uploads/Fiscal-Table1.2.jpg) and data on interest repayments from [here.](http://www.ntma.ie/business-areas/funding-and-debt-management/debt-service/)  *********  Also, just for posterity; I'm a hard lefty, not some sycophantic arsehole who thinks we should completely cut welfare to bridge the gap.

LOL just because you, the lord of all gaming knowledge and F2P think it does, unfortunately does not make it so.   &gt;he Secret World has NO buy-to-win elements, because all gear is available to ANY player. Funcom made sure that gear and clothing were two entirely different things, so that the only stuff one can purchase with real-world money is clothing/cosmetic items.  DUH, this is the same for SWTOR. Again, your inability to read is astounding? See that little link further up in the thread that has this information from SWTOR? Clearly you don't so here it is again. http://www.swtor.com/free/features This time READ a little before you go off sounding like an ass.  &gt;It doesn't reward subscribers. You must be new to the game, because we already got this stuff before F2P came in. Subscribers have received no benefit from the F2P system. Population numbers are up, sure, but now we have under-geared F2Pers ruining end-game PvP and PvE PUGs with their rubbish gear.  Again, you make me laugh. Now F2P causes the game to be ruined because of under-geared F2Pers. Again, spend a total of 10 bucks (including the 5 from the hotbar unlocks) and you get this ability to wear purple gear as well.    &gt;All of those things you've listed were introduced post-F2P. That means, subscribers are now getting more for the same price. They are being rewarded for their ongoing support. As I pointed out above, SWTOR does not do this.  Wait, so you say SWTOR doesn't reward subscribers by giving them the ability to do everything in the game plus 500 Cartel Coins a month. Yet that doesn't count for SWTOR. Only TSW and its GRAND post F2P grants for subbers counts. Yeah, I see, your logical thinking clearly is shining through. Clearly 500 Cartel coins a month for subbers is rubbish compared to 10% off the TSW store. And for the record I didn't say it was an amazing reward, just that subbers are rewarded.  &gt;This also gives you.... Full chat. Uh, nope. Even Preferred Status players have a time limit on how often they can post in General Chat. After each post they have to wait for 30 seconds before they can reply, which makes communicating on large planets difficult.  Again, click that magical little link and read a little. Be careful though it may make your head explode with too much information.  &gt;You've listed these things like they are some exciting new feature that F2Pers gain access to when they spend money on the game. They're not. These are basic features that the majority of SWTOR's F2P rivals provide for free.  My statement was that you get that for 5 bucks, TSW you have to spend 30$. Hmmmmmm 25 dollars less. Let me see if I can do basic math to determine a better value. Damn this is hard.  &gt; At least I played the game for a year before I passed comment on the model. You haven't even played TSW and you're trying to tell me it's model is inferior to SWTOR's. I mean: ""the other requires you to buy items with real world cash to get the best gear."" Did you even bother to read about TSW before you started accusing it of being P2W?  Well, to be honest, I hadn't heard of this game at all till you chimmed in and used it as a glorious example of a better model and how SWTOR sucks. My apologies for not fully knowing about a game with 120,000 units sold worldwide. But I did take some time to investigate its site and pages. Clearly more then you did. So if you dont have to buy end game gear great! Looks like that makes SWTOR and TSW even then.  &gt;SURPRISE! A Star Wars™ (one of the most successful franchises ever) MMO aimed at teenagers and developed by one of the best-known RPG developers in the world (BioWare) is making more money than an adult survival-horror MMO filled with obscure references to 19th century literature that is not part of any franchise. Of course SWTOR is more successful. It was always going to be. You only have to read some of the in-game character names to figure it out; SWTOR's player base is made up of little kids who want to play ""Jedi"". The fact that it has made more money does not prove that it's F2P system is better. It is making money despite it's F2P system, not because of it.  My comment was to the increase of Revenue after this new model was put into place. If the model didn't work and was so horrible as your Economics Degree and years of knowledge have determined, then the increased numbers should not match. But you have not provided anything to demonstrate why this model doesn't work, isn't a success and is rubbish. YOU may not like it, but there is 1.7 million F2P accounts that don't agree with you. You want to talk value? You can play the full story in SWTOR for free, for as long as you like and if you like it and want more, then you can spend a little money and get more. TSW, you get 24 hours to try out and then drop 30$ bucks. Its a pretty simple argument that you just seem to want to keep having. Notice you are the only one here to keep going and going?     ",™

You must be really struggling to counter my facts, since you've started resorting to personal insults.  &gt; Again, your inability to read is astounding?  I haven't made a single mistake so far. You, however, have made several including the horrendous error that was ""the other requires you to buy items with real world cash to get the best gear"". I'm the one with an ""inability to read""? I don't think so.  &gt; Again, spend a total of 10 bucks (including the 5 from the hotbar unlocks) and you get this ability to wear purple gear as well.  F2Pers *have* to buy an unlock in order to be competitive at end-game, unless they want to grind through some truly boring PvE content in order to accrue enough credits to purchase the unlock from the GTN. This is bordering on P2W.  &gt; Clearly 500 Cartel coins a month for subbers is rubbish compared to 10% off the TSW store.  Yippee! 500 Cartel Coins a month! I can't wait to spend them on something! Never mind the fact that the majority of the Cartel Market is aimed at F2Pers and therefore my 500 Coins are practically worthless! Never mind the fact that everything in the Cartel Market is ridiculously over-priced and I have to save up for three months before I can buy anything decent!  &gt; Again, click that magical little link and read a little. Be careful though it may make your head explode with too much information.  No counter-argument? In fairness, it is pretty difficult to argue with the truth! GG!  &gt; My statement was that you get that for 5 bucks, TSW you have to spend 30$. Hmmmmmm 25 dollars less. Let me see if I can do basic math to determine a better value. Damn this is hard.  No. In TSW you get EVERYTHING for $30. In SWTOR you get THE BARE MINIMUM for $30.  &gt; Well, to be honest, I hadn't heard of this game at all till you chimmed in and used it as a glorious example of a better model and how SWTOR sucks. My apologies for not fully knowing about a game with 120,000 units sold worldwide.  Ah yes. Back to the old ""SWTOR IS MORE POPULAR THEREFORE IT IS BETTER"" argument. As I pointed out above, anything Star Wars™ is guaranteed to attract millions of fans.  &gt; But I did take some time to investigate its site and pages. Clearly more then you did.  Uh, what? I *play* TSW. I *played* SWTOR for over a year. I don't need to read their information pages for new players, because I am *not* a new player. You say you read the information pages more carefully than I did. Explain these gems:  ""the other requires you to buy items with real world cash to get the best gear""  ""This also gives you....full chat.""  &gt; If the model didn't work and was so horrible as your Economics Degree and years of knowledge have determined, then the increased numbers should not match.  One of the biggest MMOs in the world went F2P and you think an increase in accounts means it's F2P system is a good one? I'm sorry, but SWTOR was *always* going to attract new players when it went F2P. Every MMO has an increase in accounts after switching to a F2P system. There is nothing special about SWTOR's case.  &gt;  But you have not provided anything to demonstrate why this model doesn't work, isn't a success and is rubbish.  Yeah, I have. Many times. You may wish to re-read some of my prior points.  &gt; You can play the full story in SWTOR for free, for as long as you like and if you like it and want more, then you can spend **lots of** money and get **a little** more.  FTFY.  &gt; TSW, you get 24 hours to try out and then drop 30$ bucks.  And get to experience the full game for the rest of time without ever spending another cent.  &gt; Its a pretty simple argument that you just seem to want to keep having.  What can I say? I enjoy winning, and I am most certainly winning this argument.",™

t5_2s3nb,nazna,1376341769,"She wanted a doll. Not just any doll but a particular make and model. This doll had class. This doll had Real™ bodily fluids that came out at four different speeds all controlled with five buttons (the fifth was simply, random). He'd ordered a doll months ago. A Ruby Rudy. Cost five hundred dollars. Plus shipping.     As Paul read the email from Amazon he knew it was all over.    Dear Sir,   We regret to inform you that we have oversold our stock of Ruby Rudy. Amazon will be happy to reimburse you or send you a Ruby Rudy as soon as they come back into stock (this will, regrettably, be after the Christmas season).     With Warmest Regards,   Amazon Fulfillment    There were no Ruby Rudy's to be had. Not in malls, department stores, gas stations (he'd looked while purchasing a Slim Jim), online retailers, ebay auctions, or even back alley dealers (his cousin's cousin's friend said they were harder to get than solid gold ponies though what a gangster would want with a solid gold pony was beyond him).    There was, of course, only one option. Jim. Jim, who lived in 3b (across from the Mexican woman and three doors down from Paul). Jim, who had a box with the company logo emblazoned on it sitting right in front of his door when he came home from work the day before.    At eight thirty that night Paul knocked on Jim's door. Late enough for the work crowd to be all tucked in and late enough for Jim to have already had a few beers.    Jim opened the door. He was about Paul's age. Late thirties. Had more of a paunch than Paul did and less hair on his head. Jim idly scratched the belly that was revealed by his threadbare wife beater.    ""Paul?""    ""Hey. Just bought  a six pack. Thought you might want to share. Christmas, man, it's a bitch"". Paul aimed for sheepish. Shy. Harmless.    It must have worked because Jim grinned and opened the door. ""Yeah I know the feeling. Come in. We'll shoot the shit.""    Jim never noticed the gloves.    Once the door closed Paul made his way to the bruised looking couch in Jim's living room. He sat on the cushion with the burnt left corner. It looked more appealing than the cushion with the yellow stain.    Jim cracked open one of the cans of beer. ""I would never have thought this was your brand, Paul. I figured you for one of those fancy beers with the foreign symbols all over them.""    He gave Paul a beer. He took a sip.    ""Spent it all on presents for the kid and alimony. That's the only kind I can afford until January.""    Jim nodded. ""I'm glad I never had any kids with the ex. Bad enough, paying her each month to sleep around. Had to get something for the niece, though. You can't say no to a little girl in a pink ballerina outfit and a storm trooper helmet. Kid is majestic, I tell you.""    He pointed at a cheap frame that held a picture of a little girl dressed as he'd described. In one hand she held a wand and in the other a plastic gun.    ""I see you got her that Rudy doll.""    Jim shrugged. ""You seen that thing? You can make it projectile vomit. Elisa wants to reenact the Exorcist movie. Majestic, I tell you.""    They sat quietly drinking for a while, watching cable news on the television. Jim occasionally cursed at the Fox News commentators. Paul wiped his wet hands on his pants.    ""Mind if I use the bathroom?"" he asked.    Jim nodded absently. He wasn't drunk enough but it was getting late. Soon he'd start making noises about Paul leaving.     On the way to the bathroom he spotted the box past the open door of Jim's bedroom. Beth would be so mad. He'd promised her. He'd promised. And he'd broken so many.    Paul grabbed a knife from the block in Jim's kitchen. He approached the other man from the back, slicing at his thick neck. Jim yelled. Too much noise. Paul reached over, slicing the front of his neck. Jim got up, spraying blood all over Paul. A mist splashed his glasses. He could only see through a red haze. Paul stabbed and stabbed into Jim's thick middle. He saw parts of Jim escape those deep holes. Bits of intestine and glimpses of bone as Jim brought his arms up to block the knife. Finally, Jim fell back. He wasn't fighting anymore.    Paul sat, breathing heavily. His hands were on his knees, dripping blood onto Jim's carpet. He'd cut himself during the stabbing. Jim's eyes blinked at him as his chest started to move slower.    ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's Beth, you see? She really really wants this doll and I have to get it for her. Her mom hardly lets me see her anymore after that DUI. Says I'm a bad influence with the crashing into buildings and all. I figure since it was a Wal-Mart, Jesus forgives me.""    Jim's eyes closed. His chest moved once. Twice. Paul took the ratty blanket off of the sofa, pulling it over Jim. He went into the bedroom, picking up the box with the doll in it. He never noticed the bloodstains his hands left on the cardboard.   ",™

t5_2s580,thyL_,1376344139,"&gt;I'm kind of split right now and I'd like to watch more Dota, but I think there are no more lan tournaments for a long while now, am I right? If so, why so?  Sadly, quite a lot of teams only come together as 5 very skilled individuals that try to win The International. They play together for a year, get invited, fail and then disband.   So for the third time in the coming days and weeks players will shuffle around a lot. When that's happening there's not too much sense in holding big tournaments, since you have no idea if the teams that you invited will actually be able to participate with a full roster. Organizing a LAN event for a team game is always a hassle, if you can't be certain about 9 of 10 teams to even be still existing at the point you want to hold such a tournament, is unbearable.  We'll have the online qualifiers for StarLadder (which results in Lan finals in Kiev in a few months (maybe even weeks) and probably The Defense soon™.   The biggest LAN events need time to organize and have to prove to sponsors and fans that they can put up a great show. They need us fans to love it and watch it, therefore they need teams we like to see.",™

t5_2qhsj,mouseears07,1376358235,"From the Victoza site:  ""Victoza® is very similar to a hormone in your body called GLP-1. After you eat, GLP-1 helps your pancreas release the right amount of insulin to help sugar enter into your body’s cells. GLP-1 also prevents the liver from releasing too much sugar. People with type 2 diabetes produce less insulin and may have problems with GLP-1. When your blood sugar is high, Victoza® helps your body release more insulin by acting as GLP-1. Victoza® lowers your blood sugar at the right time to help keep your blood sugar from becoming too low (resulting in hypoglycemia).""

t5_2qqqf,cube5000,1376364323,I can identify with how you feel. I have been with my SO for 29 years now and I do not talk to him or my friends about my depression. I also have complex PTSD. I only talk to my therapist and doctors about it. I do this because I say to my SO and friends that I don't want to bring them down. It's far easier to do it this way and far less hurtful for me. I have to take medication as well to cope and I only ask my SO to make sure that I have taken it if I have forgotten to. He wants to help so that is the way that he can. I also don't want to be seen as a victim around them and they now don't ask about how I'm feeling. Yes I do feel more alone and lonely about my depression and PTSD but it also saves me time and effort and energy so that I can get on with things as best as I can.   I'm so sorry that you are in the same position as I am. I'm 49 now and have these sort of things said to me all of my life as I have been depressed since I was about 4. They just don't understand and they will never know unless they are also struck down by this disease and illness that we live with. I love them anyway as they do mean well it just comes out of their mouths in an unhelpful way.   If you want to talk please PM me as I'm offering you my support.

t5_2qpkc,Kichigai,1376372956,"/u/kissmyrobot has great advice there, and knows LA better than I do (what I know about LA I know from my friends who live on the west coast, and could probably fill a shot glass. Apparently you guys have an ocean of some sort or something like that). But truth is that you might just have to relocate. When I was looking for an entry level job I did a nationwide search, knowing that areas like NYC and LA were highly competitive, the midwest wasn't exactly a burgeoning boomtown, and sci-fi producers *love* [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Television_Fund).  Honestly, I wanted to be out on the East coast really bad. I know a lot of people out there, I love the atmosphere, I just really like the whole area. It suits me. But I couldn't get anyone's attention out there, but I got lucky and landed a job here in Minneapolis. Eventually, once I have some better credentials on my resume I'll give the area another shot, but until then this is a great place to learn.  You have to start somewhere, and you can try and hang on in LA, but that might be The Hard Way™. Nothing against that method, it's admirable, but if you need to put food on the table, you might just have to branch out.  In my opinion, some markets are way too saturated with entry level guys. And I don't mean that in a bad way, but you gotta diffuse through the market and fill needs wherever they come up. As the low guy on the totem pole you need to prove yourself (I still am), so go wherever you can get the opportunity to do that.

t5_2qhvo,poorfag,1376373098,"&gt;Mordichai Vanunu is a total mental case and cannot formulate coherent sentences. He is crazy, in the literal way.     Mordechai, I don't know why I said Michael shit. And that makes no difference really, if he was lucid enough to betray his country he is lucid enough to get killed for treason, that's why the death penalty exists.   &gt;The left in Israel is shrinking.   Said everyone since Oslo and the first Intifada, but for some reason we are still freeing convicted terrorists in 2013.    &gt; I don't support executions of people, even Nazis. They should sit in jail and be forced to see the faces of the families they destroyed on a daily basis.   First, Nazis, as are Palestinians, would be delighted to see the faces of the families they destroyed. And second, how would you feel if we had caught Eichmann at an incredible high cost only to let him go free after 20 years in jail because of some retarded leftist ideal?   Yes it would be a lot nicer not to kill anybody and sentence people to life in prison, but that's not how it works in Israel, in here you can go and kill Jews all you want and you can be fairly sure that you'll get out in a few decades at most, because Jewish lives aren't really important for the Israeli government (let alone the Israeli left) when it comes to peace^©, all you need to do is wait until a soldier gets kidnapped or the current Palestinian leader agrees to sit in a table in front of Israelis and you'll be free. That's how it has worked in Israel for decades and there's absolutely no reason to believe that it will change anytime soon, we can't learn from our past mistakes so we have to build a way to avoid them altogether; that's exactly what this law will do, and that's exactly why I support it. I'm generally against capital punishment, but when the choice is between killing them or letting them free (I still can't believe such things are an option), it's clear what I'd choose. ",©
t5_2ri0h,Kichigai,1376373695,"The bitrate of what? It all depends on what your sequence's codec is. In FCP7 you'd open up your Sequence Settings, set your codec, and under Advanced options you'd set your bitrate. But I don't recommend going to compressed footage that way.  My recommended workflow is to stick with ProRes or DNxHD, and export to that natively, then convert it over (to H.264, I'm guessing). This will give you more flexibility in choosing your encoding engines (x264 offers quite a lot more finesse than QuickTime's stock encoder gives you, and it's available in many easy to use utilities, like [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/)) and encoding options. So if you're bitrate constrained for whatever reason, it will allow you to do two-pass encoding using methods more efficient than what QuickTime does by default.  It also means that if for whatever reason your encode is all bungled up (accidentally entered the wrong settings, a flashframe ruined the surrounding P and B frames, something just went wrong and the whole process went to hell) you can go back to your ProRes/DNxHD file and start over without having to re-render the whole project.  You'd also have a high quality archive file, so if at some point later you decided you wanted to encode your video in some other way (say H.265 or VP9 for newer web applications, or MPEG-2 for DVDs, etc.) then you don't have to dig up your project, find all the missing files, re-link everything, and re-render. You just go back to your master file, The One True Version™ of your project that should never ever change over time.",™

They then see works of the fans, *creations made with passion, love and inspired motivation* And they understand that what they pay for those marketing ghouls is too much, for far too little and decide that even lawsuit over using fanmade content is reasonable expense compared to the costs of paying a group of lackluster commercial illustrators to fart around 2 months and then vomit a hasty scribble upon deadline evening.  So please be understanding of their choices, for we fans are the only ones who do justice to their product.

(Ephesians 6:5-6)  Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. (Colossians 3:22)  Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, (Titus 2:9)  Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.

t5_2qh0u,samknows2,1376401111,"Also... we were contacted by Cargo 45 minutes before our flight was supposed to depart.  We were told Cupid had broke out of his kennel and had been on the tarmac.  We were told he had a quarter size scratch on his leg.  The description was a quarter size area of fur was scrapped off and he had a small cut.  Delta wanted a vet to examine him before putting him on a later flight.  We had no car as we were returning to Georgia from a trip to Colorado.  We worked with cargo and delta to reschedule our flight.  It took about 3-1/2 hours to get all the details for rescheduled flights worked out with cargo and delta ticketing.  During this time we also located a 24-hour emergency animal clinic where we could take Cupid for a sign-off.  We were BLOWN AWAY when we got to cargo and saw him.  He was not in a kennel; rather he was in the live animal room laying on the floor.  He wouldn't walk on his hind left hind leg.  There was minor blood around the bottom of his mouth.  In observing this we realized he had broken the teeth.  The quarter sized scratch was what is in the picture - we couldn't believe we were told a quarter sized scratch.  At the vet we found he had a fractured paw.  He's been in a cast since 26 July.  He gets follow-up x-rays next week.  Why should have we been concerned... here's the first paragraph from Delta's Pet First website;  With our Delta Pet First™ service, the furry members of your family travel safely and comfortably.

t5_2y6fm,CrimsonKings,1376409720,"I'd give it about a 6/10. I haven't played any mods, though. The main game is very atmospheric, its main quality in my opinion. The scenery is great, the landscape is fun to explore and the apocalyptic vibe is omnipresent.   But everything else I found rather mediocre, to be honest. The characters are ALL boring, the dialogue is used exclusively for developing the quest and the people you meet just have no charm. I couldn't give a fuck about them if my life depended on it. But I had that problem with every Bethesda game, so maybe I just personally dislike their style.   The quests are entertaining, mostly due to the aforementioned wonderful environment. They often take you to far-away places and encourage you to explore and find secrets.   The enemies and combat are nothing special, but not bad either. You mainly fight mutants and raiders, both of which you just shoot until they die. Everyone's praising the V.A.T.S., but I think it felt completely off in the middle of real time combat. How is having certain percentages of hitting someone fun, when I can just aim and use skill to kill^®?  The story is completely stereotypical bollocks. I can't go into detail without spoilers, but it had a few facepalm cliché moments and the ending fucking sucked in my opinion.   Oh yeah, and the ""moral system"". It's ridiculous. It's no fun being evil at all, because it's so easy! Every decision is made for you, you always know what will give you bad or good karma. It's nothing like, say, Mass Effect, where you're tempted into giving rude answers sometimes and it's hard to stay Paragon, let alone The Witcher where you face real, difficult moral choices. No, it's ""I'm evil, I'll murder this hobo."" or ""I'm good, I'll give him some water."" It's a bad excuse for a real karma system and it's no fun at all.  All in all, this review sounded really negative, but I was just trying to tell you my opinion on things which are usually praised about this game. It's definitely worth playing if you like Bethesda, I just think that there are way better games out there.   EDIT: Oh yeah, I forgot about the perk system. It sucks. The only perks that actually give you advantages are the ones that just improve your stats. Why even have perks if half of them simply give you better stats? That's not the point, is it? Perks are supposed to be unique ways to shape your character. The fun perks are almost all useless if you want to develop a really badass character. Very unfortunate, to say the least. ",®

It gives me a headache trying to talk politics with him because of the mental gymnastics he has to do to make his lifestyle acceptable given his politics and worldview.   He's not normal though. The majority of conservatives don't actually agree with all the republican rhetoric, the party is splintered into a lot of viewpoints, but like liberals voting Democrat, they vote for the guy most likely to win, not the one that agrees with the most of their views. In my experience, most conservatives don't care about the plight of the poor, the minorities and other religions besides their own. The problem is not that they have animosity towards them, it's that their self-serving interests have externalities that hurt others. They simply don't bother to consider what other effects taking away welfare might have besides keeping more money in their pockets right now. ",™

t5_2qh1s,_delirium,1376423983,"The standard work week here (Denmark) is 37 hours. It was changed from 40 hours in 1990, so has been a quite enduring experiment. The justification was that productivity has gone up a lot, and the country has become prosperous, so we can afford to work a little less and still be prosperous, because now, with advances in efficiency and technology, we do more in 37 hours than the previous generation could do in 40.  The typical distribution of the hours is 7½ hours/day Mon-Thu, and 7 hours on Friday. It's pretty nice, and in professional jobs, at least, it doesn't feel like any less work gets done in a typical day than when I worked in in the US. You still do a day's work each day; it's not like it's possible to literally code every minute of the workday.  It has not been easy for economists to establish whether it had any macroscopic economic effects at all, either positive or negative ones, though. The year 1990 doesn't really stand out as any kind of turning point in Danish economic history.  With the time that frees up on Friday, it's relatively common for people to stay the extra ½ hour anyway, but use it to drink a beer with their coworkers in the lobby of the building. This self-run fredagsbar (""Friday Bar"") became a tradition at Danish universities, and has spread to some workplaces.  If you'd like to read more propaganda from the Happiest Country In The World™, the Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education would be happy to advertise our [""safe and balanced society""](http://studyindenmark.dk/why-denmark/quality-of-life-1/a-safe-and-balanced-society).",™

I would make it a habit to go to the Kapalıçarşı (Grand Bazaar) and practice my haggling skills, which I'm usually not good at. Now, several things must be understood about Middle Eastern culture: 1) Americans are shamelessly overcharged for things; 2) You are not really appreciated when you pay insanely inflated prices, but rather scorned for being ignorant, and 3) If the merchant sells to you, he or she is making a profit. I remember one time I haggled so hard for a *tchotchke* of some sort that the proprietor actually got angry with me... but he sold me the item. Apparently I had crossed the invisible line of decorum for a tourist.    I am reminded of the story about an American tourist in Scotland who was a notoriously hard bargainer. One merchant, after negotiating a price much lower than he would usually sell for, watched the lady open her Velcro™-fastened purse, and sadly remarked, ""Och, that's a fine Scots pocket ye have... it screeeams when ye open it!""

t5_2s3qj,sirkazuo,1376426219,"I agree that the curve we're seeing is unsustainable, but I do think ~20-30% is the new norm until back orders of ASIC miners are shipped complete.  Right now people are getting back ordered miners that are no longer going to even break even on purchase price, but they're still bringing them online because hey, they already paid for them so why not?  I suspect that will continue to happen until BFL is shipped complete on pre-orders at least, not to mention all of the existing group buys and pre-orders that have already been paid for at other companies like Avalon and BitFury et al.  As long as people keep placing pre orders and believing in fanciful two-week™ ship dates the difficulty will continue to rise somewhere around this rate of at least 20-25%, at least that's my opinion on the psychology of it.  You have to remember that these are not all informed market players - a *lot* of them are making economic sacrifices just because they like bitcoin.  Edited to add: GPU miners going offline isn't going to make much of a dent in it.  Just look at [the graphs](http://i.imgur.com/pYs3a7t.png) - GPU miners only account for the segment under the line before ASICs started coming online.

I mutate and breed exotic plants and have just started an online interview show where my co-host and I interview scientists and philosophers. I back-engineered working repulsion technology from purported debris from the Roswell crash of '47. I do some work with exotic materials and exotic field effects. Most recently, I created a new playable periodic table of the elements where you may hear the light from each element dropped forty octaves. I have also started to learn the Qaballah. I have an agile mind and appreciate exploring ideas.   My darling wife Connie is an INFP and a holistic pharmacist and office manager. She is also the artist and dances much better than I. She delights in the kitchen and is an elegant and conscientious hostess. She is a practiced meditator and a powerful Reiki practitioner.   We meet Tuesday evenings, once a month, with our next gathering to occur on the 20th of August. If you would like to be added to the guest list, simply send an email describing how you might fit in and a link to your Facebook profile if you have such a thing, so that we can do a bit of screening.

t5_2qil2,Host_Mask,1376454292,"This is interesting. My boss feeds his 2 adult cats a vegan diet (I work a vegan restaurant. No, I'm not vegan) and they seem to be perfectly healthy. Granted, he's not feeding them ""potatoes, rice milk and pasta"", he cooks for them weekly and includes stuff like seitan, tempeh, tofu (""meat replacements"") and seems to make sure their diet contains enough protein. It always struck me as a bit extremist (and why would he have cats anyway, for an ethical vegan wouldn't that be akin to forced captivity?) but I figured as long as they were healthy, he could feed his captives whatever he wanted.   EDIT: Though after googling ""can cats be vegan"" (for which the top suggested search before I typed in vegan was ""can cats be gay"") PETA's website has this interesting snippet in an article on vegetarian diets for cats and dogs:  ""Cats are often more finicky than dogs, and their nutritional requirements are more complicated. Cats need a considerable amount of vitamin A, which they cannot biosynthesize from carotene, as dogs and humans do. Insufficient amounts may cause loss of hearing, as well as problems with skin, bones, and intestinal and reproductive systems. Cats also need taurine. A feline lacking taurine can lose eyesight and could develop cardiomyopathy. Commercial pet food companies often add taurine obtained from mollusks. James Peden found vegetarian sources of both taurine and vitamin A, plus arachidonic acid, another essential feline nutrient. He then developed veterinarian-approved supplements Vegecat™ and Vegekit™ to add to his recipes. These recipes are probably the healthiest way to feed cats a vegan diet at this time.""  So I need to put some questions to my boss and see what his deal is. OR maybe he has miracle cats.",™

Besides, if the scientific method (rather than Science™) was applied to technological civilization, the only conclusion would be that it has drastically reduced human well-being, and humans have been on a downhill happiness trajectory since the paleolithic. Since science relies on data, rather than conjecture, we would be forced to dismiss the wish-thinking of humans perfected by unicorn tech in some unknown future as quickly as we'd have to dismiss the ranting of the antiquated desert prophets.  &gt;Humans are incredibly flawed, and we need to fix them.

t5_2qh61,Jadeyard,1376465546,"I read a long article by a medicine proefssor some weeks ago. She said vegan diets of cats are a hot topic in the scientific community at the moment. She said in some cases they are recommended, when the cat has certain illnesses. But!:  You should never choose to feed a living being random things, just because you think it will probably work out. Cats have different needs than humans. If you want a vegan diet for a cat, it will definitely need supplements, just like human vegans in the first world need vitamin b12 supplements. Cats cannot get everything they need from plant-food. Personally I am under the impression that there is still too little research on vegan cats and supplements, but of course there is a philosophical problem, too. The more vegan you are, the more you'd like your cat to be vegan to, the more you need to know about a healthy, supplement-aided, vegan diet for a cat, the more reserach you need about cats and food. But the more vegan you are, the less you want the research done, because experiments with cats and food, e.g. animal tests, are also problematic.  Here are some reasons why:  http://www.essentialvegetarian.com/2007/07/08/7-reasons-why-your-cat-cannot-be-vegetarian/  ""Taurine is an amino acid essential for cats as unlike other mammals, cats cannot synthesize it.  In the absence of taurine, a cat’s retina slowly degenerates and the cat suffers eye problems and  can become irreversibly blind. This condition is called central retinal degeneration (CRD). Cow’s milk  is a poor source of taurine and there is none in plant foods. The only rich source is meat.   Arachidonic acid is one of the essential fatty acids. Dogs and humans can convert linoleic acid  found in vegetable fats into arachidonic acid. Cats are unable to do that, as their liver doesn’t contain  delta-6-desaturase enzyme (no kidding!). Cats need arachidonic acid to be able to produce an  inflammatory response so that the body can protect itself in case of disease. Arachidonic acid also  helps control skin growth and is necessary for proper blood clotting, proper functioning of the  reproductive and gastrointestinal systems. Animal fat is the only major source of arachidonic acid,  very small amount can be found in eggs and milk. Arachidonic acid deficiency takes some time to  develop but its effect on the cat is profound.   Vitamin A found in vegetables (carotenoid) cannot be converted by cats in to the active form of  vitamin A (retinol). As cats do not have the necessary enzyme to do the conversion they have to hunt other animals that have done it for them (mice, rabbits). There are sufficient quantities of retinol  in meat and very small amounts in eggs and milk. Liver is the richest source of preformed Vitamin A.  Vitamin A deficiency in cats can cause night blindness, retarded growth, and poor-quality skin and fur.   Vitamin B12 is another vitamin that cannot be synthesized by cats. Vitamin B12 is present only in animal products.   Niacin can be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan by many mammals but not cats.  Meat is the best source of niacin. Insignificant amounts of niacin can be found in milk and eggs.  Lack of niacin in cat’s diet can cause loss of appetite, loss of weight, inflamed gums, and hemorrhagic  diarrhea.   Thiamin (vitamin B1) has an important role in carbohydrate metabolism. Cats are very  susceptible to deficiency of this vitamin. Thiamin is rapidly destroyed by heat, that’s why  only raw meat is the only good source of this nutrient. Very small amount can be obtained  from eggs and dairy. Thiamin deficiency in cats can lead to anorexia, ataxia, paralysis and  finally permanent brain damage.   Protein is required by cats in large amounts. Over 30% of a cat’s diet  should consist of protein and this can be a problem on a vegetarian diet.""  Here's some more information about vegan cats and dogs that also states that supplements are required for cats, just as they are required for humans in th current society.  http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animals/meatless-meals-for-dogs-and-cats.aspx  ""Cats are often more finicky than dogs, and their nutritional requirements are more complicated.  Cats need a considerable amount of vitamin A, which they cannot biosynthesize from carotene,  as dogs and humans do. Insufficient amounts may cause loss of hearing as well as problems with  skin, bones, and intestinal and reproductive systems. Cats also need taurine. A feline lacking taurine  can lose eyesight and could develop cardiomyopathy. Commercial pet-food companies often add  taurine obtained from mollusks. James Peden found vegetarian sources of both taurine and vitamin A,  plus arachidonic acid, another essential feline nutrient. He then developed veterinarian-approved  supplements Vegecat™ and Vegekit™ to add to his recipes."" ",™

t5_2sokd,Mobiasstriptease,1376486903,"""If I have to pay taxes on a 401k when I withdraw, who cares if I pay taxes now or then""?  You nailed it! that really is THE question.   Answer: you can either pay the taxes now and get to spend the rest of your money, or you can invest your money AND the portion of your money that would have been paid in taxes currently, let it all grow for a few decades, and then pay about the same, or possibly less taxes later. (Hint, second one is the best choice! 😉)  Also, couple tips for OC on 401k's: if your company offers a match, take it! It is FREE money! Contribute AT MINIMUM the amount your employer is willing to match. Secondly, don't drive yourself mad trying to choose where to put the money in your 401k, because at the end of the day no one can predict the future. You can always just put it in a fund that has a target retirement year. Those funds are targeted to grow more when you're younger and automatically redistributed to safer/slower-growing investments as you age. It is a great 'set it &amp; forget it' selection,",😉

The mature and miracle-minded among us support people in being attractive. Part of working on ourselves, in order to be ready for a profound relationship, is learning how to support another person in being the best that they can be.

Though the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute recommends against the practice (as it claims the equestrian helmets are — paradoxically — tested for slightly shorter falling distances), there doesn't seem to be consensus on whether they are indeed less effective. It's possible that this *used to be* an issue, but that with safety standards being enforced in both sports, crossover use of helmets between bike riding and horse riding is possible.  * [**Gucci**](http://www.gucci.com/ca-en/styles/284374J391N9067?gclid=CIzTgcWX_bgCFdAWMgodJksAlg#284374J391N9067)  It all should key on your needs according to your lifestyle and riding style. As others have stated, ventilation could be an issue if you tend to create a lot of heat through intense pedaling or if you ride in warm weather. Some of the full-coverage helmets have ways to offer ventilation through suspension above the head, but it won't be as good as the classic style of bike helmet with open vents.  Once a certain amount of ventilation is attained, though, any gains in cooling are small unless you actually remove the protective headwear. I recall my surprise at reading a recent article stating that the difference in the temperature of the rider's head was negligible from helmet to helmet, or even between wearing a helmet and not wearing one — the main difference is in perceived comfort, not in actually protecting the brain from overheating. (Unfortunately I can't for the life of me remember where I read that, so I'd be interested if someone has information supporting or refuting that claim.)  The other issue is the range of situations in which a helmet will make a significant difference to your well-being. For instance, unless it's one of the new anti-concussion designs a helmet has minimal effectiveness against concussions; in addition, a helmet will not be helpful in many catastrophic accidents. It's in the range of spills, falls, and relatively slow crashes into hard objects where a helmet makes the difference between a headache and a cracked skull. I would think, then, that any helmet meeting safety standards would suffice for preventing the types of injuries helmets are made to prevent. Factor in the relative safety of cycling in general, and (in my opinion) you shouldn't worry that one or another cycling helmet will be less safe. Just make sure to wear it, if you want the protection it can provide.",®

Just think. What is an Egyptian toddler doing in a protest camp? Does it have enough cranial capacity to choose whether to join El Sissi or the Brotherhood? The answer is simple, they are used as bait for the True Media™.  Ask yourself, what kind of a person would willingly endanger their own offspring by putting them in the middle of a protest? The kind that would sacrifice anything or anyone for the furthering of their agenda – the kind that is the least to be entrusted any responsibility, let alone a nation.

That's a problem, and doesn't exactly make him seem worth it. I would consider it good that you are taking steps to further your life from that level.   DO NOT kill yourself, please.

But I'll tell you one thing, it was nothing like she expected. It's painful and sad and I had to tell her family for insurance purposes and we're all just in shock and trying to hold back our tears. Don't do that to your family. Don't do that to your friends.

t5_2s7yr,offtherocks,1376517313,"OK. The reason I ask is because it sounded like using mouthwash didn't bother you, and you only felt bad about it because you later learned that it contained alcohol. Like raevie said, it's not like the alcohol is going to jump down your throat.  JBH mentioned that he thought topical products might cause a problem for antabuse users. I have no idea if that's true, but JBH seems like a pretty upstanding fellow, so I believe most things he says, except when it comes to football.  If you're not worried about triggering a drug like antabuse, and if using alcohol based mouthwash doesn't bother you at all, I wouldn't worry about it too much. I use alcohol based mouthwash. Always have, probably always will.  I like it.  (Though, as an aside, I think I'm going to switch to fluoride-containing mouthwash after [reading this fellow's comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kajhc/dentists_of_reddit_what_brand_do_you_actually/cbn2uu2) He seems to know what he's talking about. The More You Know♒★ )  Some people like to avoid alcohol-containing products because these products trigger them by inducing cravings or making them think about drinking. Some people avoid them because they figure, ""better safe than sorry.""  Some avoid them because they get a psychological kick from living a 100%-free alcohol life.  All of these are good reasons to avoid alcohol containing products.  What I'm saying is, there's no one right way to approach this. Be honest with yourself, and do what works best for you. ",♒

I started off ""just looking,"" as my roommate at the time (a different one) had a dog, and we thought it might be nice for her to get a playmate, but I was NOT serious about buying her. Then I laid eyes on her, and I was pretty much done for.  When I brought her home, I had a day off of work with her, and then I had to leave and kennel her while I was at work. SHE BROKE OUT OF THE KENNEL AND DESTROYED MY EVERLIVING POSSESSION! I was so mad. I sat on my bed and CRIED, asking myself if I had made a terrible mistake. But with lots and lots of work, and tons and tons of training, she is now the perfect animal for me. She's spunky, FULL of personality, very stubborn, she moans loudly at me when I'm keeping her up too late watching TV, she makes friends easily, but people and dog, she is a total goofball and never fails to make someone laugh with her stupid behavior...She's pretty much the best thing to ever have happened to me!  I also work with my friend Amy's rescue organization that she runs herself. She goes in the middle of the night to grab puppies at high kill rate shelterse the same night they are scheduled to be euthanized, sometimes sneaking the puppies out the back at 3 am with help from a nice shelter worker, and then drive them back to ouir town, works with a local vet to give them cheap shots, gives them a flea bath, and then puts them in foster homes until she can do outreach and find them a fur-ever home.

All fees are in U.S. Dollars and remain subject to change in our discretion and where notice is provided as required by Applicable Law.  Transaction Description	Fee ADDING/RECEIVING FUNDS Funding Fee - Loading/Adding funds into your Account (does not apply to Sub-Accounts)	$0 SENDING/WITHDRAWING FUNDS Personal Send Money to another User	$0 ATM TRANSACTIONS MoneyPass™ Network ATM	$0 Out-of-Network ATM	$2 for each ATM withdrawal plus any fees assessed by the ATM owner or operator NOTE: New York, Arkansas, and Vermont residents shall not be charged any of the fees listed above. Fees assessed by the ATM owner or operator may still apply.  The schedule above sets forth fees we impose on the respective transactions.Other parties (such as merchants with respect to point of sale transactions, ATM operators or networks with respect to balance inquiries and access to funds in your Account, and other financial institutions with respect to transactions such as cash withdrawals at their branches) may impose separate fees on the same transactions and we make no accounting for those.  We will deduct all applicable fees from the balance in your Account, or as applicable, Sub-Account, at the time of the imposition of the fees.  b. Types of Transactions. (1)Personal Send Money Transaction. A ""Personal Send Money Transaction” involves an individual who sends money to another individual (such as a friend, a relative, or a colleague) through the Serve Site (an online transaction) or a mobile application, that is NOT in connection with a purchase of goods or services or payment of a debt or amount owed to another. Examples of Personal Send Money Transactions are sending your children’s allowance to them. Any payment to a merchant, business, or any type of commercial entity or any payment sent in connection with the sale of goods or services or for payment on a debt or amount owed is not a Personal Send Money Transaction.  (2)Personal Receive Money Transaction. A ""Personal Receive Money Transaction” involves receiving money from another individual (such as a friend, a relative, or a colleague) through the Serve Site (an online transaction) or a mobile application, that is NOT in connection with a purchase of goods or services or payment of a debt or amount owed to another. Examples of a Personal Receive Money Transactions are receiving your allowance from your parents. Any payment received by a merchant, business, or any type of commercial entity or any payment received in connection with the sale of goods or services or receipt of a payment on a debt or amount owed is not a Personal Receive Money Transaction.

A Purchase Receive Money Transaction involves any transaction in which an individual receives money from another individual or entity through the Serve Site (an online transaction) or a mobile application: (a) in payment for the sale of goods or services; or (b) as a payment to a business, merchant or not-for-profit entity.  (5) Card Transactions. When you use your Card or Sub-Account Card to make point of sale transactions at participating merchant locations or through a merchant’s online store, you will not be charged a fee by us for such transaction.  If you use a Sub-Account Card to make a point of sale transaction at a participating merchant location or through a merchant’s online store, you must have Available Funds in your Sub-Account for the entire amount of the transaction and any applicable fee(s). The merchant or other third parties may impose additional fees for such transactions, which may be added to the cost of the transactions. For example, a merchant may impose a $1.00 fee for paying by a Card at the point of sale where permitted by Applicable Law.  In the event you do not have sufficient Available Funds in your Account at the time the point of sale transaction or online store transaction is initiated with your Card to cover the cost of the transaction and any applicable fees, and you have chosen to have Back-Up Funding with permissions set to cover the amount needed for the transaction in question, then we will attempt to load funds to your Account from your eligible Back-Up Funding Source (or, where applicable, a combination of Back-Up Funding Sources), in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the transaction and any applicable fees. IMPORTANT: this Back-Up Funding feature is not available for transactions conducted with Sub-Accounts or Sub-Account Cards. If such load(s) is successful and the newly loaded funds qualify as Available Funds in your Account (which may occur at or near the time the point of sale transaction at the participating merchant or online store transaction is initiated), then the point of sale transaction or online store transaction may be able to be successfully completed. Although we will attempt to do such loads where you have chosen Back-Up Funding, it is possible the transaction will still be declined, and you agree we have no responsibility in the event that any Card or Sub-Account Card transaction is declined where you do not have sufficient Available Funds in the Account (or Sub-Account where a Sub-Account Card is used) to cover the transaction and any applicable fees at the time you initiated the transaction.  Fees apply when you withdraw funds from an ATM, as specified in Section 10. Additional fees may also be imposed by the ATM owner/operator (for which we make no accounting).  Neither a Card nor Sub-Account Card can be used to make payments to other Users or entities on the Serve Site.  (6) Serve Check Withdrawal. You may also withdraw funds from your Account by requesting a check to be issued to you at the mailing address we have on file for you. To request funds to be withdrawn from your Account via a check, please contact Customer Service.  It will take 7-10 business days to process the request. There currently are no fees charged to withdraw funds from your Account via check. Checks are void after 90 days. If you need to have a stop payment order placed on a check issued to you, please note that a stop payment can only be placed on a check that was issued within 90 days of the original stop payment request. Stop payments may be requested by calling or writing to Customer Service. There currently is no fee for stopping payment on a check.",™

t5_2qhsj,crystal2435,1376535786,"Most likely your mother's employer puts aside a fund of $3000 for her insurance account in the HRA. And that is what you have been using to pay for the prescriptions rather then the copay that you think you are paying. So now that you have used the HRA up for the most part you are now responsible for paying for the portion of the prescriptions that your insurance does not. You are probably not responsible for paying the deductible now, minus the $3000 the company gives, until the insurance will pay again.     ""The Cigna Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) is funded by your employer. This account works with your health care plan to help you pay the out-of-pocket costs for some covered medical expenses.   How the Cigna plan and HRA work   Plans can vary, but below is a basic summary of how an HRA works:1   At the start of the plan year, your employer deposits a certain dollar amount into your Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) The dollars in your HRA are used to pay eligible health care expenses. The money used counts toward your deductible (the amount you pay out-of-pocket before your plan starts to pay) After the money in your account is used up, you pay for all of your health care expenses up to your annual deductible amount When you reach your deductible, you and your plan share the costs (coinsurance) for covered services Your costs for covered services are limited by an out-of-pocket maximum as defined by your plan Money not used during the plan year may or may not roll over to your account the next year, depending on your plan (contact your employer for details) You can combine your HRA with other types of reimbursement accounts, such as a Healthy Awards Account® and/or Healthy Future Account®, if offered by your plan. Your employer decides how and when you earn or use these account dollars""  Edit: some more info I forgot. ",®

Another reason would be to clear out areas underneath or behind rocks/shells for breeding...do you notice any two of your fish 'courting' each other? The nature of these cichlids is to dig and move the substrate regardless, but from my many years of owning a planted Tanganyikan tank, I know that your amount of sand 'excavation' seems to have motivation behind it; other than just the natural tendencies of cichlids.  Keep in mind, the look is not a bad thing and I actually like the look of undulated substrate...just be sure they're getting enough grub.  P.S. I like the setup 👍",👍

Cause apparently a few of you read this and enjoy them, so you guilted me into doing it, and I did it, yay!  * **UEH**  - I totally appreciate the extra effort in the makeup and costume, Its nice to see this from you.  Like, this is totally the level I hoping to see you at in this competition based on the first few vids of yours, and I'm glad to see you bringing it.  Its an awesome song to start the list with, happy, fun, and your dance moves are awesome and fun.  And you get really into it to! I love it! I noticed at like 3-ish minutes in your sync gets a little shaky, some early and mis-timed entrances but really it was fun, and the level of body movement more than mkaes up for it,  Like I wanted to get up and dance too.  Now just make sure and keep it up, its wonderful!  * **Sigourney_Weaver**  - OKay I still wonder if it was intentionally supposed to look kind of like evan or not, lol but your look s close enough to make me think it.  I love the amount of attention you put in your backgrounds.  Also I love you for doing this song, and in a not obvious direction either. Oh and as everyone else pointed out, love your boobs! lol.  I know you were going for less polished, and paired with this concept it so totally worked! I'm glad to see you mixing it up by not being overly polished and just having fun and it says a lot that you can take these chances.  And omg I've seen this like 5 times but the wig cutting still gets me! Aah! lol And then the paint, givin a hint of Whatamidoingwhat and a whole lot of OMG that paint is gettin everywhere!  lol siggy you crazy.  Its a great concept and one that almost forces you to keep watching to see how its going to end and what you're going to do next, very smart. Its loose and fun and messy and has its OMG moments and I thought it was an awesome addition to your list of vids, and to this week. Given us Mrs frizzle realness here! takin chances making mistakes and getting messy, and you get bonus points for messing up yo house in the name of art, lol.  Thats dedication bitches.   * **SailorEvan** - You know its so damn not fair that you put on a long wig and some eye makeup and you look so naturally girly and pretty, and I'm going to take the higher road here and not be grumpy about it and just say WERK it gurl.  And also THANK YOU for doign Spice girls, I needed that to be in this week.   I don't know if I was on board immediately with the direction you took the video, but you're so comedic and sassy you always make it work and its always so evan, lol.  And will always support puns in any shape or form so I loved it when you started bringin the props out. Points for the crazy messes you were makin, lol, and as Starkfinn called it, the HI-C ejaculation, lol and the look on your face afterward, lol, awesome.   Like I really super love your vids, I would just love to see you go a little more polished one week. I've seen you do campy funny and you rock it, but its been longer since I've seen you do some less funny, more traditional lip syncy-performance syncing like your musicals week one.  I mean you keep doin what you like, Id just like to see you mix it up with a little less camp, a little more polish.  But still I dont think the evan trains stopping anytime soon, cause you're very likable and doing good kid!  * **StarkFinn** - OKay I sat through a whole backstreet boys song just for you Gurl, err mister, and I dont do that for just anyone ♥  I love love love that you went to a location! And the unbuttoned shirt blowin in the wind at the beach, it was all perfect choices. I agree with simon, you were lookin a bit girlish in the body department, but first of all you are a girl, second you were on vacation, and last a lot of men are looking really manish in many departments not to mention most of them are genderfucking all over the place, so theres no reason to picky about that at all.  Your face was great and the makeup looked great.  And also, you were on vacation and filmed this, and thats the dedication I love!  That being said in the middle I was lookin at my watch a bit, but thats cause the song choice a bit, but I love watching you and I was perfectly happy finishing it.  And I loved the little touch of fading in the beach noise at the end, and your cute smile.  I still thought it was perfectly fitting for this week, and a great job.    * **misskittycharms** K so after some thought I have to say this. Sadly if paired next to eachother Can't touch this just wont win against Scrubs. I wanted to like cant touch this, but yeah I agree with that scrubs is a little more enticing and I know you wanted to reverse that decision so hugs. I liked the way you treated it tho the fakeout  concept was fun.  And as for your look I liked it! I super appreciate all the makeup you do.  I like me some makeup, especially pretty girl makeup and you bring that every week. I think you really werked it out in your sync actually,  no it wasnt super on point but you were fierce and energetic and fun!  and some of those moves you brought out, lol, so cheesy, I loved them. I was thinking though,  I would love to see you servin that fierceness directly to the cam, and not to yourself lookin in the cam window.  I keep feelin like I'm sitting next to someone you like better and am gettin no love cause you're always looking slightly to the left.   Also the old TV filter wasn't ma fav.  I wanna see you crisp and clear, not so faded out and filtered. ---------------I know you're already beating yourself up and saying goodbyes, not sure if its THAT bad gurl, just next time make sure to do like a final check in your head.  1.  would I want to watch this for 3-4 minutes all the way through. 2. am I well lit/hows the picture quality (cause like last week, lower quality picture actually worked with the song but this week that filter faded you out) and 3. how does everything fit the song.   And that way if you record multiple songs you can figure which is the strongest.  I really commend you for having fun, I do, but remember that checklist.  You showed awesome power and energy and fierceness So its in you gurl, we just gotta make sure it comes across to everyone. *hugs* ♥ And remember kitty,  It's a goofy internet competition for fun.  TBH You really did make me smile when I watched your vid, and the happy energy you put in was awesome. After watchin all your vids we are so going dancing together when/if we meet in real life, lol, fo sho gurl. ",♥

t5_2t1w0,Thontor,1376574495,"We have been told the old dev blog is still what they are planning to do.  so... here it is.  We don't know how current game modes will fit in, nor do we know where the lobby (formerly known as ""dropship mode"") will play in.     http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/2247-dev-blog-1-community-warfare/  &gt;**Faction Warfare**  &gt;The Inner Sphere is broken up into several factions, each with their own regions and sub-regions. Each faction is warring with at least one other faction at all times in a universal territory battle. Players can be active or passive participants in this battle by following one of three paths:  &gt;* Pledging Allegiance to a Faction  &gt;* Joining a Mercenary Corporation  &gt;* Remaining Neutral  &gt;At its core, the territory battle is a fight for resources – planets. Planets are divided into three types. Each type requires a more active level of participation by the player and as a result earns a greater reward.  &gt;* **Core Worlds** – Are managed by the dev team. These are worlds that necessary for future planning and part of major historical events.  &gt;* **Faction Worlds** – Are fought over by Faction players. These planets buffer core and border worlds, and do not play a significant role in major historical events. Rewards for controlling these planets are directly linked to global bonuses and abilities associated with a player’s Faction.  &gt;* **Border Worlds** – Are fought over via a contract bidding system by player run Mercenary Corporations. These planets change hands on a regular basis, and have no impact on historical events. Rewards for controlling a boarder world are significant and go directly to the occupying Merc Corp.  &gt;It’s important to state now, that worlds can change from Border to Faction to Core, or any combination thereof, at any time by the development team. This will be necessary to facilitate dramatic changes in faction territory control as we progress through some tumultuous times within the BattleTech® universe.  &gt;**Faction Worlds**  &gt;The battle for control over faction planets is a simple war of attrition. The faction with the most influence over a particular planet occupies it. By virtue of simply competing in online matches, faction players contribute influence points to target planets.  &gt;**Border Worlds**  &gt;Mercenary Corporations can bid and fight for occupation rights of border worlds throughout the Inner Sphere. Merc Corps must bid on a planet’s occupation rights via a system of contracts generated by the game.  &gt;A match or series of matches are set up between the defending Merc Corp and the challenger. The victor is determined from the results of each match, and takes control of the planet. They are rewarded with an immediate contract payout, and will continue to earn rewards while they occupy the planet.  &gt;**Loyalty Points and Ranks**  &gt;Loyalty Points are used to determine how devoted you have been to a particular faction. The more loyal you are, the greater the reward. LPs are earned by engaging in activities that further the goals of a particular faction.  &gt;For Example: Killing an enemy faction player would earn 1 LP.  &gt;Loyalty Points decay over time if a player is not active. Participating in negative actions can also decrease LPs.  &gt;*Faction Players*  &gt;As a Faction Player, loyalty points are earned by playing and winning matches. As the player accumulates loyalty points, they will gain a military faction rank at pre-determined loyalty point totals. If a player loses LPs by decay or negative actions, they will be demoted.  &gt;Gaining ranks earns special privileges and items, including membership to special units, unit skins, and bonuses to C-Bills and XP. These are all non-permanent and subject to the player maintaining a certain rank level. At the highest possible levels, players can begin to influence their faction by controlling which planets are targeted in territory conquest.  &gt;*Mercenary Corp Players*  &gt;As a Mercenary Corporation, all members’ earned loyalty points go to the Merc Corp. The Merc Corp must have a minimum amount of loyalty points with a faction before they are able to engage in planetary combat on behalf of that faction. Loyalty points also determine the type and level of contract a Merc Corp is permitted to bid on. These loyalty point restrictions mean that a Merc Corp’s membership, must remain active in order to maintain the required level of LPs.  &gt;Ranks are created within a Merc Corp by the Merc Corp leader. The naming of the ranks is entirely up to the Merc Corp leader who can assign Merc Corp level permissions to each rank.  &gt;*Lone Wolf Players*  &gt;As a lone wolf, the player can earn loyalty points through participation in random matches, however these LPs have no positive or negative implications. A lone wolf player does not have any ranks.  ",®

t5_2qh3p,throwaway_quinn,1376581049,"&gt; I think it's weird that you have a wife for no real reason other than to have sex with her  I think it's weird that you read about a man who doesn't have sex with his wife and deduce from that that sex is the only reason he's married to her.  &gt; just communicate with your wife about how sex can be enjoyable for both of you.  I sure that's never occurred to him, in 25 years.

t5_2vadq,headlessparrot,1376586429,"And we round out the trek through my father’s liquor cabinet with this, the stuff I grew up on—the stuff I learned to mix into a Crown and Cola for my parents basically before I could even see over the kitchen countertop (two ice cubes, three fingers of Crown, top with Cola in a rocks glass). I’m surprised I haven’t gotten around to reviewing this one yet, and I’m surprised there’s really only one review of it in the archive, because it’s basically omnipresent.  **Crown Royal Canadian Whisky**; no age statement; 40% ABV; 750mL; retails for about $28 Cdn. in Ontario (though I’ve seen it go for as low as $22 Cdn. in Alberta, because privatized liquor stores want to kill me).  **Appearance:** e150a. Legs, but pretty runny legs. Can’t deny the beauty of the Crown Royal branding, though, as I’ve said elsewhere.  **Nose:** Vanilla, toffee, butterscotch some oak and wood char. Hard water, or limestone? Something sort of ‘rocky’, if that makes sense, like gravel or pebbles. Light dusty rye, light baking spice, clove, and cinnamon. No small amount of alcohol prickle. Light maple. Varnish. Faint pepper around the edges. Peaches and citrus zest. I’m still trying to make the phrase bourbon-lite™ a thing, but that’s what really strikes me about the CR profile—taking the dominant characteristics of a bourbon and lightening and watering them to make them palatable to a larger audience.  **Taste:** A bit watery, but decently creamy. Less bite than I remembered, initially, but a growing peppery tingle as it sits in your mouth. Light rye spices (more than I recalled, though) with vanilla, light toffee, some varnish notes. Citrus pith. Warms the whole mouth. Faint citrus. A bit of a bitter woodiness that’s not ideal (though at least it pulls back from typical Canadian whisky sweetness). But honestly not bad. Smooth. The vanilla really grows and asserts itself more over time. It’s not at all perfect, but I could drink this neat or on ice all day long, which is not something I can say about many sub-$30 Canadian whiskies.  **Finish:** Short. Some of that bitter wood lingers, but there’s a nice mild heat throughout the mouth, and some lingering rye spice. Light vanilla. Toasted oak. Gravel. Light bitter citrus pith.  **Final Thoughts:** Crown Royal is the Jack Daniels of Canadian whisky. It’s popular, it’s decent (albeit young, one dimensional, and with some bite), it does its best work in cocktails (seriously? I’ll never in my life turn down a Crown and ginger), it’s coasted on reputation, and it gets a lot of hatred from whisky snobs who seem to think they have something to prove. But it’s fine. Outright hating it seems to me to be disingenuous, somehow (whereas I think outright hatred of the standard CC seems a lot more justifiable). And even if you do, complaining to the mountaintops about how shit this stuff is isn’t going to change the opinions of the millions of people who love it and sip it religiously. But it is useful to us in at least one way—it demonstrates nicely the process of dumbing down that leads yesterday’s prestige brands to  gradually become today’s mainstream brands (and eventually tomorrow’s discount brands) that are allowed to coast on reputation. There’s almost no collector’s market for Canadian whisky, but it’s not surprising that what little market there *is* (just from my cursory glances) seems to orient itself largely around pre-1970s bottlings of Crown Royal, when the quality of the company’s flagship brand actually seemed to matter something more to them.   **Score:** 73 ",™

Obama tends to say things people want to hear when visiting/addressing them while ordering drones/backing despots/etc. Bush did similar shit but was somewhat less reluctant to talk about them and wasn't as much of a sweet talker, might have been because he was in the middle of the rise of the ""War on Terror™"".

Maybe one day!  I had someone i wanted to be with in Seattle for a long while now. I don't know if i could call her a girlfriend right now, but it is definitely worth it and i couldn't see myself doing anything else even if it's an especially difficult route for me to take. I honestly don't have any selection for schools but i'll find something fine and make the most of it.  I don't think my friends will be joining any FC's but if there's any one i'd have them apply to join, it would be Esper's United to be sure. (: They are usually not too keen on being in groups even if they're casual and completely reasonable guilds.  Hopefully i'll see some of you at 2am PDT for tonight's beta days.

t5_2r4zz,petzl20,1376610067,"&gt; So can we all collectively give 3AM their props   Lets be honest:  what it really is, is AM (Amanda/McCrae).    Aaryn is not a comp beast; she rolled a ball and got lucky, plus she has *no* chance if she's in the Final 2.  Aaryn is a goat.  Andy has a social game, but in Final 2 I think he loses 10/10 times to McCrae (to Amanda, I think he has a better chance due to Amanda's ""bitch"" factor).  In any case, he's still a fool for getting into an alliance with AM. Andy's only hope is to be in Final 2 with Aaryn, meaning he has to get rid of *both* Amanda and McCrae?  yeah, good luck with that.  All props go to AM.  They've deluded 2 players, 1 who has no chance to win, 1 who has a very slim chance to win, into allying with them.  What's really driving the alliance is Andy's mistaken impression that he can win while allying with AM.  ----  Gotta say: the fake alliance with Helen-- that is **Brilliance**.  McCrae deserves an Oscar® for his performance.  It's amazing Helen believes him (basically he has convinced her that *he* is an asshole-- that is, someone who could be so intimately/emotionally involved with Amanda but still stab in the back). So, in a weird way, McCrae should be insulted:  ""You really thought I could be that much of an asshole, Helen?""  In a certain way, Helen psychologically allow herself to believe McCrae is being deceitful to her: if she does, her whole world comes crashing down: it would mean Andy, McCrae, and Amanda are all against her (her brain will fight to keep the fantasy alive rather than allow her to entertain a suspicion of the reality).  What's going to be interesting in the coming days and weeks is watching Helen watching Amanda/McCrae.  She will be thinking *""Gee, McCrae, for someone who is about to betray his lover, you* still *seem awfully sincere to Amanda.  I cannot detect any deception/deceit when you talk to her.... Hm... What could that mean....?""*",®

t5_2qh61,mightybonk,1376614207,"OK Reddit, now I tell you the story of The Steam Room:  Almost exactly 1 year ago, I was on my honeymoon in Thailand.  Shirking the smelly backpacker experience, and travelling in off-season, we had the expensive resort experience instead. After enduring spectacular food and cocktails in the pool for a number of days, my newly minted wife booked us in for a ""spa treatment"".  Sounds pleasant enough, right? Bit of oil, bit of massage, some incense and relaxing music floating around. Hell, my skin could use some nourishing after the sun-burn the other day. What a great idea!  We attend the spa, and immediately have to nude up. I am given a small strip of elastic, webbed cloth which hides nothing and just makes my junk look like an octopus caught in a hooker's stockings, and a bathrobe to cover my bunched and veiny shame.  Once unsuitably clothed, we are ushered into The Steam Room™, with some reverence. The mighty steam room is a tiled enclave, with a heavy glass door and a computer controlled steam unit under the firm wooden bench you sit on.  We take a seat, there is a hissing sound and steam mildly scalds the backs of my ankles.  ""Ow fuck!""  ""Oh sweetie, you're just too tall for the room. Your feet aren't supposed to go so far back under the seat.""  ""Yeah, great.""  So I'm in the foetal position, curled up on top of the bench, with the wood digging at my tail-bone, now prominent due to my posture; when the steaming begins.  The temperature in the steam room rises.  The air becomes thick with increasing humidity.  And the walls of the people-oven grow slick with beads of the condensation that could no longer bear to be so hot.  I am not comfortable. This is not relaxing.   The digital display by the door reads 85.  ""85 what? 85 degrees? 85 minutes until we are cooked through? Are we the 85th couple stupid enough to pay for this?""  ""I think it's temperature, sweetheart.""  ""Good, I can adjust it then.""  ""I don't think you should adjust it.""  ""Well, I don't think I should be treated like a fucking dumpling.""  I stand. I am actually weakened by the temperature in the room. It takes a 2nd attempt to open the glass door to access the digital display and adjust the temperature.  ""You females actually do this to yourselves? Steam treatments?""  ""It's good for your skin.""  ""What? Melts it off so you have to grow new stuff?""  ""No silly. It opens your pores and lets all the dirt out.""  ""The only thing coming out of my pores is sweat and hate.""  I turn the human-steamer down to 65, and get a drink of water. Returning to the room, it is slightly more comfortable. I last a good 2 minutes before I have to leave the torture-box again. The air outside is so cool, refreshing, clean, wonderful... all my positive adjectives.  I spend the remainder of the steam treatment talking to my wife through a glass door, drinking bottled water and pacing the area outside the door in my ridiculous lace panties, trying not to slip over on my own sweat and crack my skull open on the ornate basin at the end of the room.  I voiced various conclusions reached and my dear wife just nodded and smiled, from amongst the pain-vapours in the person-poacher.  ""Those competition sauna dudes are fucking morons.""  ""I wonder how much people pay to have these rooms installed.""  ""Boiling lobsters alive must be terrible. I think I'm going to never do that. Poor bastards.""    And that is the first and last time I used a steam room.",™

For every Stencil Spider™ you will need:   2 paperclips   2 nuts (the metal kind, not the food or testicles)   Small piece of tape      This is not rocket science, but it might take a couple more tries than you think to get it right.  Straighten out the paperclips.  Holding them both at the midpoint in one hand, twist one around the other.  Make sure they are very tight.  If they wiggle at all, they will fall over frequently while you are trying to set them up.     Once they are tight, bend the three ends you now have to form a little three-legged creature.  Once you have the them in a shape that allows it to stand on its own securely, slide the nuts over the twisted end, on to the middle, and tape them in place.      That's it.  I hope you find this useful.  It's kind of tedious, but once you have them done they should last quite a while.",™

t5_2smhl,Tsojin,1376619594,"""Liandry's Torment ticks will tick 6 times at half second intervals. Each tick does 1% of enemy current health as magic damage. Damage from each tick is calculated individually. ◾ This effect checks on every tick if the enemy movement is impaired and will deal double the magic damage (2%) if true ""  So in fact outside of random rounding liandry's cannot kill a person. Also I could be wrong but I don't think the 1st tick of dmg is applied instantly.  Since it is an 'on hit' spell it doesn't apply at the same time as your spell hits, its first calc looks like it comes after the spell has already taken the dmg away from the champ (ie if you hit them w/ a spell when they were at 100% it doesn't calc them at 100% health it calcs them for their current health after the health is removed, which seems to be why it isn't not good at all on burst mages since you fire several spells at once and they reapply the DoT too quickly for it to 'tick' off for its 1st dmg until after all of your spells have hit.  This seems to be true for most on hit effect (a slight delay before they appear on target).",◾

t5_2qhpm,Blood-Wiper,1376630835,"What the FDA has to say...  **Carbohydrates**  Objectives  Why do so many health experts praise foods like pasta, cereals, and whole grain breads? It’s all about carbohydrates, the foundation of a healthy diet. Thanks to carbohydrates, you have the energy to walk, run, breathe, and even to read this module. Plus, carbohydrates help your body in other ways. But, be advised, not all carbohydrates are created equally. After reading this section, you’ll be able to:  􀂏 Identify various functions of carbohydrates in the body  􀂏 Identify the two main types of carbohydrates  􀂏 Identify sources of complex carbohydrates  􀂏 Explain the health benefits of fiber  􀂏 Define lactose intolerance  􀂏 Define and list empty-calorie foods  Functions of Carbohydrates The world would be an awful place without carbohydrates. Just think — we’d have no rice, bread, cereal, pasta, cookies, or many other popular foods. Even worse, **our bodies wouldn’t have the energy to function without carbohydrates. That’s because the primary role of carbohydrates is to provide energy to every cell in the body. Each gram of carbohydrate in a food provides 4 calories. Glucose, a carbohydrate, is the only energy source for red blood cells, and is the preferred energy source for the brain, central nervous system, placenta, and fetus.** There are two categories of carbohydrates: simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. The body digests carbohydrates and eventually converts them into a sugar called glucose. Fiber is a complex carbohydrate that isn’t digested and doesn’t provide energy, but offers other unique benefits related to the intestinal tract. The following sections describe the two types of carbohydrates. Simple Carbohydrates (Sugars) Simple carbohydrates have a fairly basic structure, which is why they are called simple carbohydrates, simple sugars, or refined sugars. Most people think of table sugar when they hear the word “sugar,” but there are actually different kinds of sugars with different levels of sweetness. Simple carbohydrates can be either monosaccharides (single sugar units) or disaccharides (two sugar units joined together). **While simple carbohydrates occur naturally in food, like fructose in fruit or lactose in milk, many foods also contain added sugars. Either way, your body can’t tell the difference — it treats all sugars as basically the same. First, enzymes in the intestine break the sugar down to single units. Then they’re absorbed into the bloodstream, carried to the cells, and converted to energy to carry out the body’s functions.** Some commons sugars follow: 7  􀂏 Sucrose is the same thing as table sugar. Sucrose comes from plants such as beets, sugar cane, and corn.  􀂏 Lactose is the sugar in milk. During digestion, the body breaks lactose into glucose and galactose. Some people have trouble digesting lactose; this is called lactose intolerance.  􀂏 Fructose is the sweetest of all sugars. It occurs naturally in fruits and fruit juices. It’s also added to certain foods, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).  􀂏 Glucose is the main form of carbohydrate that our cells use for energy. It’s found in many foods including fruits, vegetables, and honey. In the body, it is carried in the blood, so it may also be called blood sugar.  􀂏 Other types and names of sugars — When looking at ingredients on a food label, you’ll find many terms referring to added sugars. A food is likely to be high in sugar if one of these names appears in the first few ingredients, or if several names are listed: Brown sugar Corn syrup Dextrose Dextrin Fructose Honey Invert sugar Maltose Malt Syrup Mannitol Molasses Raw sugar Sorbitol Sucrose syrup Sugar Table Sugar versus Other Sugars It’s a common misconception that honey and brown sugar are more nutritious than table sugar. But actually, they’re nutritionally about the same; the body breaks honey down into glucose, just as if it were table sugar. However, since honey contains fructose, it is sweeter than table sugar so you might be able to use less of it. Brown sugar is table sugar with added molasses for flavor. So, just like table sugar, it has 16 calories and 4 grams of carbohydrate per teaspoon, and is nutritionally the same. Likewise, “raw sugar” is just like table sugar from a nutritional standpoint. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is one of the most common sugars that Americans consume. It is added to sodas, baked goods, salad dressings, candies, ketchup, syrups, cereals, juice drinks, etc. HFCS has received a lot of attention in the past few years due to its abundance in the American food supply. HFCS is a special corn syrup that has been treated to contain more fructose than similar products that contain sucrose, giving them a sweeter taste. Although equal amounts of HFCS and table sugar contain the same calories, some in the scientific community have linked high consumption of HFCS to adverse health effects, such as increased risk for obesity, liver disease, diabetes and related complications.  Lactose Intolerance People with lactose intolerance have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar that is naturally present in milk. The problem is that people with lactose intolerance don’t make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose in the small intestine. So milk and foods that contain milk cause bloating, cramping, gas, discomfort, and diarrhea. Babies are born with the enzyme necessary to digest lactose, but some people lose this ability as they get older. It’s an inherited condition, and certain groups have higher rates of lactose intolerance, including Native Americans, Asians, African-Americans, Middle Easterners, and 8 people of Mediterranean descent. Infants may also temporarily lose the ability to digest lactose after a gastrointestinal illness. Many people mistakenly refer to lactose intolerance as a milk allergy. Milk allergies exist, but they’re quite different. With milk allergy, a person’s immune system reacts to the protein (casein) in milk. The severity of the intolerance varies from person to person. Many people with lactose intolerance can drink a small glass of milk or eat products like yogurt, pudding, and cheese without any problems. Usually, aged or fermented products such as hard cheeses or yogurt are better tolerated, since the processing of these products reduces the lactose content. Also, products that have been treated with lactase are available (such as Lactaid ®). Calciumfortified soy or rice milk, cheese, and yogurt are also options. Complex Carbohydrates (Starches and Fiber) Complex Carbohydrates are components of foods called starches and fiber. The structure is more complex than that of sugars, so we call starch and fiber “complex carbohydrates.” Chains of three or more sugars form large, intricate structures, and offer health benefits beyond energy. Both types of complex carbohydrates are important in a balanced diet. Starches Most of us refer to foods like potatoes and rice as “starchy” foods, but what exactly is a starch? Simply put, a starch is a number of glucose units linked together (a polysaccharide) in long chains; they act as the energy storage units in plants. Grains, such as wheat, rice, corn, and oats are the richest source of starches. Other sources include legumes (dry beans and peas) and starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, yams, and corn. Starchy foods are very important because they contain a variety of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber.  Empty-Calorie Foods Have you ever heard the term “empty-calorie foods?” These are foods that contribute calories without providing many other nutrients. Often, foods high in refined sugars fall into this category. Empty-calorie foods, like those in Table 3, replace other, more nutritious foods in the diet. To make matters worse, some of these foods, such as doughnuts and pastries, contain a lot of added fat, which means even more empty calories. So the advice is to make smart choices and limit intake of empty-calorie foods and beverages.  **Functions of Fat**  In foods, fat provides flavor, aroma, and texture. Aside from making our ice cream creamier and our cheese tastier, fat serves a number of important functions in the body:  **􀂏 Fat provides energy. Each gram of fat provides 9 calories, so fat is a very concentrated source of energy. Also, the body stores extra calories as fat, creating an energy reserve for times of food shortage. The recommendation is 20% to 35% of calories from fat daily.**  **􀂏 Fat is needed for the absorption, storage, and circulation of vitamins A, D, E, and K in the body. Because of this, these four vitamins are called the fat-soluble vitamins.**  **􀂏 Fat provides essential fatty acids, part of the chemical structure of fats. There are three essential fatty acids that must come from the diet: linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids. We need these fats for proper growth and brain function, especially as infants.**  **􀂏 Fat tissue provides cushioning for internal body parts like the liver. Fat underneath the skin acts as insulation to help the body maintain a constant internal temperature.**  **􀂏 Fat also provides the feeling of fullness when eating.**  [You can read the rest here if your're interested...](http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Sharing_Center/CO/training/l2basicnutrition.pdf)",®

t5_2uc81,StarTrackFan,1376632359,"The communist manifesto isn't a ""bible"" of communism, the ""10 planks"" were Marx and Engels' immediate demands based off the conditions surrounding the revolutions of the 1840's, it's not a checklist for ""real communism"". It was written as a response to a specific situation and while it does act as a good introduction to aspects of communism it also needs to be kept in mind that it was meant to radicalize people in a particular time and place. Again, it is not a ""communist bible"". There is no such work.  Marxism isn't a closed system based off everything Marx wrote or anything like that. I defined Marxism before as:  &gt;a growing/changing economic/sociopolitical worldview and method of socioeconomic inquiry based upon a materialist interpretation of historical development, a dialectical view of social change, and an analysis of class-relations within society and their application in the analysis and critique of the development of capitalism. Marxism encompasses an economic theory, a sociological theory, a philosophical method and a *revolutionary* view of social change.   Marxists don't seek to dogmatically follow the works of other Marxists, but rather to learn from real life practice and follow a revolutionary method that's been developed/built upon to better inform them for future struggles. This doesn't mean that there are ""no rules"", that you can't hold that there are definite theoretical stances that define someone as being Marxist or not, or that there's no metric for what a proper Marxist stance is, but it does mean we oppose idol worship. Many Marxist thinkers have been brilliant and incredibly prescient -- contributing greatly to both general Marxist theory and political movements of their time -- and every one of them was wrong (or mistaken) in several ways as well (about general things or even things related to movements of their time). They also were all limited by the times they lived in -- some of their ideas were correct for where/when they were, but not for some other times/places. Holding all of Marxism to the predictions of one of its thinkers for a specific place/era is like holding modern evolutionary biology to having to fit the words of Darwin. It just makes no sense.  As for your comment on the USSR -- no communist would claim that the USSR achieved the mode of production called ""communism"" -- meaning a classless, stateless, moneyless society. Instead, the USSR represents the first time in history where there was a proletarian revolution and establishment of the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" roughly along lines Marx and Marxists expected, and where, for the first time in history on a large scale, a group with scientific understanding of the historical process (Marxists) were in power and consciously implemented policies based on this understanding to change their society.   ""True Communism"" is a phrase typically used to represent an ideal -- one that reality can't live up to, at least not anytime soon. People who talk about this and say things like ""real communism has never been tried"" miss the point entirely. Rather than face the gritty realities of revolution and building socialism, many people would rather simply deny all historical attempts and appeal to some future perfection without really specifying how we'll get there. The problem is not that Stalin misread Marx, or that if we just properly explained to everyone the idea of a communist society we'd all just be living in one tomorrow -- this is idealism. Marxists understand that ""people make history, but not in circumstances of their own choosing"" -- meaning that people in any given time are limited by the conditions they find themselves in. Real revolutions don't happen in a vacuum. They have to face many problems, internal and external, some unique to where/when they are and other pretty universal ones including but never just limited to: internal reaction, foreign invasion, food/supply shortages, etc all while trying to enact policies to fundamentally alter the economic basis of their society. There are bound to be mistakes, stalls, reversals, and many other problems, especially when breaking so much new ground. Reality in general is messy, imperfect and violent, and revolutions doubly so.  ""True Communism™"" types, in their haste to disregard real life communist endeavors because of their problems, also throw out (and join in the denouncing of) their numerous great successes. Anyway, we've discussed this many times, here are some past threads you might find helpful:  [What is/has been the closest to a true, Marxist communist society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/17dnwj/what_ishas_been_the_closest_to_a_true_marxist/)  [Why does communism have to be global to succeed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/17gl4o/why_does_communism_have_to_be_global_to_succeed/)  [What does it mean exactly to be 'as radical as reality itself'? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1k3mah/what_does_it_mean_exactly_to_be_as_radical_as/)  [Is ""Using the Soviet Union as an example of Communism is like using the Democratic Republic of North Korea as an example of a Democracy.""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/14t0zx/using_the_soviet_union_as_an_example_of_communism/)  I also suggest using the search function in the sidebar, you can find a lot more stuff on DOTP, the USSR etc.  Also, I don't really feel like addressing all of the ""10 planks"" and how they relate to the USSR -- it would require some in-depth explanations (hard to fit anything but silly strawpeople into images, eh?), but basically the ""10 planks"" are not a communist program, they weren't the program the communists in Russia were following, and trying to bend things done in the specific situation in Russia from 1917-1990 to see how they fit unmet desires of communists for revolutions in the 1840's is a kind of pointless exercise.

Too often, I see players flying in a straight line trying to chase faster planes in the Chaika. You gotta remember, it's a biplane (even though it's made of Stalinwood™), a well placed burst from a fighter with .50 cals or cannons will quickly down a Chaika.

t5_2smr1,Kerbologna,1376661896,"From the forum:  So, I've been thinking long and hard here about how we're going to do the 'earning science' bit. It's a good idea, but putting it in practice poses a few challenges.  How do we rate the science value of your missions? What even defines a mission in the first place? These things are actually pretty hazy in terms of how the game deals with them, so coming up with a nice, solid way of doing science is a deceptively tough task.   I do believe I've worked out a good solution now:  The game won't award you any science automatically. That would be artificial and generally meaningless, but worse still, it would require us to make arbitrary decisions about the science value of this or that action. That's a bad road to go down. Instead, we can let you 'do science' as part of your missions, and get your science points for yourself. Here's how:  We already have a few science sensor parts, which apart from a context menu readout, are largely decorative. We can put those to some use now, along with a couple other scientific parts we're going to add.   The idea is that science parts work as one-shot experiments. That is, they're activated by action group or as part of the staging sequence, and once deployed, they to their thing. This is essentially deploying the experiment to gather data. This data isn't science yet though, because you need to get it to your resident experts over at R&amp;amp;D to crunch the numbers and make some sense out of it.  To do that, you can recover the experiments (or whatever is left of them). That will convert the data you gathered into scientific knowledge, provided you don't already have it. This is done by us storing where each experiment was run and what it was, and using that 'source' as a key to a multiplier value, which starts at 100% and gets progressively lower the more data on the same subject you gather. The more you spam the same type of experiment in the same place, the less science you'll get for the data it generates.  Now, if we've learned anything this far, it's that recovery is by no means guaranteed. So here's where the antennas and comm dishes finally get a purpose. Once available, you can use comms equipment to transmit science data back down and gain science immediately. Of course, you can't expect to get as much knowledge for the same experiment data if you beam it back as if you had recovered it hands-on. How efficient the data-for-science rate is depends largely on the quality of the antenna being used, as does its power requirements.  The possibilities for what the science-gathering parts can be then are pretty huge. They could be anything from experiment canisters filled with some mystery goo, a camera array, a mass spectrometer, anything really. Functionally it all works the same way, and better yet, it works with the game rather than over it.  That's about it in a very tightly packed nutshell. I'm pretty happy with this idea now, it should fit any style of playing. You could focus on running as many different experiments as possible in Kerbin's lower atmosphere, or rush into discovering the different properties of Mystery Goo™ across the farthest reaches of the solar system, and hopefully any point in between as well.

t5_mouw,scientologist2,1376663492,"PAPER:   [A Novel Class of Anticancer Compounds Targets the Actin Cytoskeleton in Tumor Cells](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/73/16/5169)   **Abstract**  The actin cytoskeleton is a potentially vulnerable property of cancer cells, yet chemotherapeutic targeting attempts have been hampered by unacceptable toxicity. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to disrupt specific actin filament populations by targeting isoforms of tropomyosin, a core component of actin filaments, that are selectively upregulated in cancers. A novel class of anti-tropomyosin compounds has been developed that preferentially disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, impairing both tumor cell motility and viability. Our lead compound, TR100, is effective in vitro and in vivo in reducing tumor cell growth in neuroblastoma and melanoma models. Importantly, TR100 shows no adverse impact on cardiac structure and function, which is the major side effect of current anti-actin drugs. This proof-of-principle study shows that it is possible to target specific actin filament populations fundamental to tumor cell viability based on their tropomyosin isoform composition. This improvement in specificity provides a pathway to the development of a novel class of anti-actin compounds for the potential treatment of a wide variety of cancers. *Cancer Res; 73(16); 5169–82. ©2013 AACR.* ",©

A mi personalmente me cabrean los intentos de equiparar las cosas como si fueran simplemente dos bandos. Lo que pasó el 73 fue resultado de presiones estadounidenses en el marco de la guerra fría. El socialismo no podía implantarse en Latinoamérica bajo ningún concepto, y si ya estaba, se le hacía la guerra.   Si los EE.UU. no hubiesen participado de esto, jamás hubiésemos llegado a este nivel de violencia. No había ni tradición de golpes de Estado, se les convenció de ello. Esto no es justificable con nada, como no lo es tampoco lo que le pasó a Morsi en Egipto hace poco.

t5_2rww2,twinkeltoes,1376672595,"Ooh, I love this idea! I really want to try the Quimica now. I have two items:  1. Sonicare - these toothbrushes get your teeth so clean, it's amazing. After I brush my teeth my mouth is so refreshed it's one of the best feelings. I actually had a dentist appointment for a cleaning a few weeks ago, it was the first time I had gone in a year and a half (whoops) and she said my teeth and gums looked great. They're kind of expensive especially when compared to regular toothbrushes, but they probably cost half the price it takes to fix a cavity. [This](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-Essence-Power-Toothbrush/dp/B000AMRII0/ref=sr_1_37?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376669733&amp;sr=1-37&amp;keywords=sonicare+toothbrush) is the one I have it's only 60 dollars right now and I know they have package deals sometimes at Costco. Basically using one of these toothbrushes combined with flossing (I like [these](http://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Clean®-Teeth-Floss-75-Count/dp/B002WTCK1E/ref=sr_1_5?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376671166&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=floss+picks)- I am more inclined to floss if I can look at r/MUA at the same time ;)) has made a huge difference in my oral hygiene, and has honestly improved my quality of life.  WOW. I just realized how much I love my toothbrush. Haha, definitely a HG item for me.  2. Alba Botanica very emollient body lotion - I live in a place with 0% humidity so lotion is a must. Out of all the lotions I've tried this makes my skin feel the softest (which is super soft). It is thick and creamy but easy to rub in. I have tried all of them (original, unscented, dry skin, and SPF) and like them all. They cost about 20 dollars for the large bottle depending on where you get them, but the bottle lasts me for months- I put it all over my body up to my neck every other day.

t5_2qh2p,xSez16cH,1376678147,"&gt; Well, if there aren't any supernatural forces (like free will), then all creative forces, be they from humans or universes, are simply processes of information.  i don't really believe in free will.  and i'm still confused as to what a 'creative force' is?  if they're merely forces, then they have the byproduct of 'creating something' but they're primary purpose is not TO create something.  take the grand canyon for example; would you call 'flowing water' a creative force?  or would you just call it flowing water, and the byproduct of the flowing water is the grand canyon.  flowing water doesn't exist to cause grand canyons; grand canyons are a byproduct of flowing water.  gravity doesn't exist to CAUSE planets to happen, planets happen as a product of gravity.  &gt; There might be an ""end goal"" of the number π or their might not be, but it's still a creative process in the sense that it's creating something (an irrational number/pattern)  it seems you're implying purpose here.  what makes you think that it's a reasonable concept for the universe to have an 'end goal'?  &gt; If you want to claim that there is such a process of creativity that is not a product of the laws of physics or their properties then I'd be interested in hearing about it!  cre•a•tive (krē-āˈtĭv)  ▶ adj. Production of; creating. adj. Characterized by originality or expressiveness; imaginative: creative writing.  creativity, in the strictest sense (production of) has an end goal (what are they producing), and since physical laws do not have a goal, they cannot 'produce' something.  they cannot be 'creative'  &gt;  So it's not like anyone is introducing a new word now.  that's kind of a narrow view, there are new words being added to the dictionary every single year.  &gt; But if I label something as ""God"", then that thing is God, to me.  but calling something 'god to you' is utterly useless.  if it's purely subjective to you, then it has no effect on my life, or bearing on reality at all, if however, you're calling something god that we all can relate to, then we can both determine if you're calling something god, that can be legitimately called 'god'.  &gt; And if lots of people like my term, then it's actually God to them as well. ""God"" (as in that set of lines) is just a symbol, though, and, as you say, isn't the actual thing. It's just a label. But that's true of all words, except maybe the word ""word""!  as i said before, if you then communicate your definition of god to me, then i can determine if it is your own subjective definition (and therefore has no relevance to me) or it has some bearing on reality, where i can then determine if that is an acceptable definition of god.  there is a [church of google](http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/), who worship google as 'god'.  i do not count 'google' as god, since it already is well defined as a company, internet organization, privacy thief, and others.  calling it 'god' doesn't automatically make 'god' google - or google 'god' no matter how many people 'agree'.  consensus doesn't make truth.  &gt; OK, it looks like you've got a very different definition of ""reasonable"" than I do.  so to you, EVERYTHING that anyone can possibly imagine is 'reasonable' to believe?  &gt; How do you define reasonable?  rea•son•a•ble (rēˈzə-nə-bəl)  ▶ adj. Capable of reasoning; rational: a reasonable person. adj. Governed by or being in accordance with reason or sound thinking: a reasonable solution to the problem. adj. Being within the bounds of common sense: arrive home at a reasonable hour.  &gt; Ok, that's a new definition of ""atheist"" to me! How do you define ""atheist"" then, if not ""someone who doesn't believe in God""?   it is someone who doesn't believe in god.  ANY god.  &gt; (You have to define something before you can negate it's existence, otherwise you're just being silly!)  i did, i said ALL DEFINITIONS OF GOD.  &gt; Do you do philosophy as a career? Can I see your work somewhere?  no, i graduated university for philosophy; i work in information security.  &gt; Me, personally, I've been lots of places, and studied all kinds of things, which has been a fantastic experience  so where are your credentials from?  to be a philosopher, or scientist, you NEED to be accredited from somewhere.  where are you accredited?  &gt; I've been a professional philosoper for about 8 years now, and you can take a look at some of my work at http://www.thewiseturtle.com  that does not look like any philosophy i've ever studied or seen before, what exactly is you 'career in philosophy' entail? i mean other than your word barf in a website.    mind if i call you turil?",▶

They didn't even prevent movement while walking on stairs, I have no idea how they can get away calling such a thing ""supportive"" for athletic activity. Anyway, no one should have to suffer while exercising. I know a couple people who physically could not do anything higher impact than brisk walking because the pain was unbearable. A Panache and two Enells later, and they claim they can't even feel their boobs move while wearing them. It's interesting how life-changing something so seemingly simple can be.   And then those ""bad"" sports bras end up causing damage to the breast tissue (which then causes scarring and fat necrosis) since they are basically just a coverup with no aim to support, especially with breasts that aren't small and incredibly self-supporting (which most people don't have).

As I have a limited amount of time/attention span I tend to direct it to my friends or someone/thing that is cracking me up. Nothing at all against anyone else.    I pop in and out, and I never know when to end a convo, and don’t want to pester anyone (lies: sometimes all I do is pester) but what if we both feel obligated to continue and four months later there’s a thread that has devolved into “I know, right” “Yeah” “Dude!”? and we are well and truly hating it?

t5_2qj8f,stmonkeydoom,1376700841,"&gt;...relieve manic behavior, including reducing extreme mood swings...  Mood swings are not a symptom of manic behavior. Manic depression (now called bipolar disorder) was so called because the individual would go from states of depression to states of mania. Manic behavior would mean that the mood doesn't swing.  &gt;...uncharacteristic behavior and agitation...  Helps cure homicide! But not in serial killers, as that would be characteristic behavior.  &gt;...without the potentially dangerous side effects associated with many psychiatric drugs  Well, I gotta' agree with them there.  &gt;MoodCalm is easy to ingest and hassle-free with no artificial colors or preservatives.  or medicine... natural or otherwise.  &gt;...the safe and effective homeopathic formula  Well, they're half right.  &gt;MoodCalm may be used without risk of negative interactions.  I gotta' disagree with this one, cause I'm pretty sure whoever takes this for anger issues will have negative interactions with other people.  &gt;MoodCalm is also a great complementary remedy to Triple Complex Calm Tonic™, another homeopathic remedy which relieves the effects of anxiety, stress and nervous tension. Triple Complex Calm Tonic may be taken at the first signs of frazzled nerves, anxiety and imbalanced moods for effective help in calming temper or anger outbursts and mood swings.   Wait a minute, that's what this shit is supposed to treat!  &gt;Life is often described as a rollercoaster.  Also: a box of chocolates.  &gt;It is also common to experience severe mood swings that lead to outbursts and other extreme behaviors that affect daily functioning in a negative manner.  When is this common? Seriously, that's all they give me.  &gt;Homeopathic remedies work to support the nervous system, treating the central cause behind the mood swings.  And the central cause is...?  **Under directions**  &gt;For all ages: Take 2 tablets every 30 minutes.  Alright, how long should a bottle last?  &gt;One bottle of MoodCalm contains 180 lactose tablets and lasts for approximately 30 days depending on amount.  OK, so, assuming a normal 16 hour wake cycle, thats 64 pills a day, so a bottle will last me...  Well, let's look at it a different way. 1 dose is 2 pills, so there are 90 doses in one bottle, over 30 days, that makes 3 doses per day. So your day should be an hour and a half long.

t5_2r9vp,ThatDamonGuy,1376705899,"Sorry! Here it is. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21566064  ""Abstract  Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive constituent of cannabis, is considered an antineoplastic agent on the basis of its in vitro and in vivo activity against tumor cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which CBD mediates this activity is yet to be elucidated. Here, we have shown CBD-induced cell death of breast cancer cells, independent of cannabinoid and vallinoid receptor activation. Electron microscopy revealed morphologies consistent with the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed these findings. We showed that CBD induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and, subsequently, inhibits AKT and mTOR signaling as shown by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1, and cyclin D1. Analyzing further the cross-talk between the autophagic and apoptotic signaling pathways, we found that beclin1 plays a central role in the induction of CBD-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Although CBD enhances the interaction between beclin1 and Vps34, it inhibits the association between beclin1 and Bcl-2. In addition, we showed that CBD reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, triggers the translocation of BID to the mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and, ultimately, the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells. CBD increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS inhibition blocked the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Our study revealed an intricate interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in CBD-treated breast cancer cells and highlighted the value of continued investigation into the potential use of CBD as an antineoplastic agent.  © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research.""",©

The islands themselves are beautiful, and it's actually a really nice place to visit when the Triennial isn't running (almost no people). One of the highlights for me was biking around Naoshima, stopping off at all the little sandy beaches along the way for a dip to cool off.  I am really looking forward to seeing it all again this year, although probably going to wait until October to avoid the heat, and the crowds.  I loved all the exhibits in the Chichu Art Museum on Naoshima but the building itself was the masterpiece for me, incredible. I also really enjoyed [Inujima](http://www.benesse-artsite.jp/en/inujima/). The Seirensho Art Museum was pretty awsome, and the island itself has a fairly interesting industrial history.  The ""I♥湯"" sento on Naoshima, followed by an ice cold bottle of Ramne is also a really great way to relax after a long day of walking.  ",♥

[As I don't know how to write this out, I recorded a video of it.](http://youtu.be/0f9ekqYsYDo)  I've never really played fighters all that much but this game got me interested and I'm in the process of trying to learn simple things on charaters to figure out which ones I like.  Thus far I haven't liked anyone but Squigly, mostly because I can't figure out any combos for anyone else.  On that combo I linked I also switch out the attack I land on the falling enemy. I've noticed that most abilities work quite well there.  Also if I do the ↓↘→LK version I can hit the grave special attack too and then continue that with this combo from the beginning. She's a lot of fun to play to me. :)",↘

t5_2t2fz,LullabyGaming,1376716514,"I wholeheartedly agree. I love how easy it was for me to get in to the beginning stages of Skullgirls.  I've been a **very** casual player when it comes to fighters, but I always hated how hard they were to get in to because there's always like +20 characters with dozens of moves each and they all abuse the crap out of the directional buttons. I always hated when you had to do crazy moves on the d-pad when you wanted to do a single cool move.  Friend recently bought Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and it re-ignited my desire to play fighters. Tekken is great because most of the moves just use the attack buttons instead of the d-pad. This is the same reason I like Skullgirls.  There's only a few characters so it's easier to get in to, there's not all that many different attacks on each character since there's only 3 different versions on each basic attack with crouch, stand and jump and then there's a few extra moves which use simple d-pad controls.  I've never been able to pull off any even moderately decent combos in other games so I was always the guy who spams a few different strong attacks over and over again.  Now with Skullgirls I've been able to figure out a couple of combos all by myself! Usually in other games I had to look up combos on the internet etc. to do anything and even then I couldn't reliably pull those combos out. Here in Skullgirls on Squigly I managed to figure out a combo that's a lot of fun for me to use and I can pull it out whenever I want to.  [This combo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9ekqYsYDo) is what I came up with, it's probably complete garbage compared to the things you can do in this game but I do feel a bit proud of coming up with it by myself as I don't really have any previous experience with fighters.  I'm definitely sticking to this game and hopefully one day I might even be moderately decent at it! ♥",♥

But his picture-perfect life is turned upside down when a suicide bombing in a restaurant leaves nineteen dead, and the Israeli police inform him that his wife Sihem, who also died in the explosion, was responsible. Convinced of her innocence, Amin abandons the relative security of his adopted homeland and enters the Palestinian territories in pursuit of the truth. Once there, he finds himself in ever more dangerous places and situations. Determined, he presses on seeking answers to questions he never thought he would be asking.

t5_2qhqt,lufaise,1376754792,"There are no positives to take from this. The squad cannot compete over the course of the season period. There just is no depth, first team aside.  Ramsey at CB is pretty much the story of our summer. No CBs to bring in off the bench? Ridiculous. No proper defensive minded midfielder to fill in for Arteta? Ridiculous.  The officials were terrible. Absolute disgrace but that doesn’t change the fact that the squad is *just not ready for a PL season,* let alone the CL (assuming we can win the tie against Fener...).  Predictable booing towards Wenger. It’s hard to even defend the man anymore. The money is there. He knows we needed cover in multiple places.  For all his talk of challenging for the title in the most open race in years-other teams unsettled, other teams with new managers, finally no significant departures--he hasn’t done anything to pursue the title.  With a patented Arsenal-injury-crisis™ brewing with players out and likely to be overworked with such a thin squad, there’s not much to look forward to besides more fixtures like this.  Wait until 9/2 indeed...  (Thoughts are with Sagna. I hope he recovers from that fall and has no lingering issues from it.)",™

t5_2qh68,theartfulcodger,1376757037,"This is not quite The End of Canada As We Know It, but it is *hardly* a non-issue. In truth, it is a textbook example of The Harper Government™'s arrogance, dismissiveness, narcissism, vindictiveness and pettiness: all serious political character flaws that continue to infuriate many Canadians on a daily basis, because they are woven into the very fabric of every policy this government formulates, and they inform and twist every decision and statute it makes on our behalf.   Canadians have an innate sense of fair play. Unlike the citizens of some other nations, we do not, by nature, subscribe to a culture of meanness, bullying, cruelty, and might-makes-right. And we are perfectly correct to become both embarrassed and angry when our leaders so regularly display such churlish and paternalistic behaviour.   This incident is especially egregious because the victim was *literally* Canada's point man in space for many years, and on this particular day, a small recognition of both his huge personal contributions, and his deep personal connection to the actual object being celebrated, should have transcended any partisan political considerations. Unfortunately, it seems that *nothing* transcends partisan political considerations for The Harper Government™, and our nation is far the poorer for it - politically, scientifically and culturally. That's why this grisly little *contretemps* was, and *is,* an ""issue.""",™

t5_2qh4s,nicekid81,1376762475,"What phone service provider do you use?  Do you have a budget?  Are you okay with purchasing used phones or would you rather buy a new one?  It's hard to make a recommendation without knowing all the details, but I'll try.  [GSMArena](http://www.gsmarena.com/) is a great website to reference - if you're moving up from the Desire S pretty much any phone within the last two years should be an upgrade.  (Assuming you have a GSM service like T-Mobile or AT&amp;T) If you're not looking to tinker with the phone, may I suggest the Windows Phone OS? I personally prefer the interface over any Android ROM or iOS; The OS works out of the box, has a fair amount (not as much as Android or iOS, but still) of apps (it does have a GBA emulator, as well as SNES) and is priced well below the Android and Apple counterparts - the [Lumia 520/521](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_520-5322.php) line is $100~$130 unsubsidized (meaning, no contract required) and is available for T-Mobile or AT&amp;T.  On the high end of WP8's line is the [Lumia 1020](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_1020-5506.php).  As far as Android Smartphones go, the [Nexus 4](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_4_e960-5048.php) is a hard phone to beat.  There are newer phones out there like the [HTC One](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_one-5313.php) or the [Galaxy S4](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9500_galaxy_s4-5125.php) but they will cost significantly more, and not for much gains (IMO).  Now for a darkhorse recommendation; if you're on a budget, I'd recommend the [LG Optimus L9](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_optimus_l9_p769-5025.php) only because you can buy the phone brand new for $119 unsubsidized through [MetroPCS](http://www.metropcs.com/metro/detail/LG_Optimus_L9™/610214632647#.Ug-4qUCt--I) - a decent deal but unless you're on their (and possibly T-Mobile's) network, you will have to unlock it, which may be a dealbreaker for you.  Now, if you're on a CDMA network like Sprint or Verizon, some of the phones I mentioned are available but you have to make sure that it is the CDMA Variant.  As far as Apple phones - I personally have limited exposure to those phones, but they are solid enough phones; the price barrier + the fact that they do not have microSD slots were some of the dealbreakers for me.  I'd say do some research online - there are plenty of smartphone reviews out there, and see what you like.  It's definitely a buyer's market out there.",™

t5_2w4x2,BoredDan,1376764817,"I actually think the closer to T:A the basic use is the better for two reasons. First, while T:A spectate is missing some things, it really is a easy to use and great flowing spectator client for this style of game. Second, the best way to allow casters to pick up on it quickly is to use what they are familiar with, and since T:A is the big one right now it would make sense to make that transition as easy as possible.  Now with that in mind I'm going to write the rest of my post like a T:A spectator wishlist as that's what I'd like to see T:A spec++.  1. Auto hotkeying of players, or some form of quick selection option.     * These hotkeys could be added to the score screen of spectators     * Would ideally be customizable (i.e. set capper to 1)     * Persistent between map changes     * Could be a two key system/menu (aka Team hotkey -&gt; Player hotkey) 2. Jump to action hotkeys     * Would show up beside action logs like ""X is the Rabbit (P)""     * Could be user customizable list of keys     * Would jump to the point where it happened 3. Picture in picture     * Select screen choose PIP, jump to new screen     * Perhaps two hotkeys, one to have new screen as small picture and one to jump to new screen putting old one in small picture     * option to toggle large and small pictures 4. Map overlay     * Off, On, Full screen     * Display hotkeys for players     * Show lines from kill shot to death (X-----&gt;☠) and passes (X-----&gt;☼-----&gt;X) 5. Lots of information     * Overlays, overlays, overlays, toggle heaven     * Allow casters to bring up whatever info they want     * Best tricks, expanded action log, specific/filtered logs (kill, pass, cap, flag, player, etc.), player match stats, whatever people can think of. 6. Death markers     * A skull, X, or better yet cause of death marker that appears where a player died     * Obviously toggleable, perhaps more options like only flag carriers  That's all I have for now, I'll probably update this post as I think of more things.

Here's some info about the blog:  &gt;""Little Ladies Who Lunch™ chronicles the story of one mother’s attempt to find a healthier way of eating, cooking and living.  The family’s journey began with a diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolemia for 3 out of 6 household members just before the start of the 2010-2011 school year.  LLWL was initially started as a private way for the blogger, a mom of 4, to hold herself accountable for the foods she served to her family. After sharing her food ideas with friends and family and later finding a home at Tumblr.com, the blog caught the attention of Tumblr’s Food Spotlight section with posts like this unique twist on pizza as well as dozens of interesting bento ideas.          &gt;At its inception the blog focused exclusively on cholesterol reduction based on the advice of multiple lipid specialists, which unfortunately entailed using fat-free “fake” options instead of whole, real foods. Since then the blogger moved to a more well-rounded approach to overall wellness by looking at the big picture rather than focusing on one element of the family’s health by highlighting a diet rich in whole, natural foods.  &gt;Little Ladies Who Lunch features delicious, healthy and colorful fare (always sans artificial food dye) that appeals to kids and adults alike.  The blog encourages readers to prepare meals using organic produce, humanely-raised meats, pastured dairy products and love.  As the blogger herself says “we aren’t perfect eaters, but we’ve come such a long way since our diagnosis and are continuing to make improvements slowly and surely.  I hope we can inspire other families to do the same.”  """,™

t5_2qh1o,DickRiculous,1376806254,"Chloe was my first cat's name. Chloe was my parents' cat. They owned her before I was even born. She wasn't a cat who was in anyway remarkable, as far as cats go, but just by being her, she did something for me that I don't know I would have gotten anywhere else.  I have really bad ADD. Like, the real kind, for real. I was diagnosed way back in elementary school and prescribed Adderall™. Well, little prepreteen me wasn't a fan of the medication. I always went out of my way not to take it. It made me feel like a robot. I could not live like that.  Growing up, Chloe wasn't really down to let me play with or spend time with me. I mean, of course, I didn't realize that 'antagonize the kitty' may not be a game that kitty wanted to play, or maybe i put her tail in my mouth too many times, but she wasn't down with me, and I wasn't down with that. I made a concerted effort to be a physically gentler and more graceful person. More aware of my actions in my mind, and methodical in my movement and execution. By the time I was in middle school, Chloe would sit by my side as I did all of my homework, and I could touch her all I wanted, so long as I didn't make any sudden movements and occasionally bribed her with pieces of Polly-O string cheese-- damn that shit's bomb; but I digress.  One summer, I came back from a long term camping adventure called sleepaway camp. My Chloe was in poor health. She died soon after I got home. My parents told me that our cat had some kind of kidney problem, and that they'd had her on some kind of kitty dialisis, because they knew I'd want to say goodbye. My little 14 year old heart broke. When I got home, Chloe was in my room, on my bed, chilling where she always did as I worked.  The cat was gone, but the experience wasn't. I maintain to this day that having Chloe around was the strongest tangible reason that I was able to overcome my ADD to the extent I was able. I still have it, but I also have impulse control.  1 year out of college, now I'm chilling with a furry little homie named Jefferson. Super skittish at first, but I feel like I've soothed him, because cat whispering, naturally, is one of my many hidden talents. Life is good for us, and I hope that your Chloe brings you as many cosmically-serendipitous-real-life-upvotes as my Chloe brought me.",™

t5_2qh2p,rapscallionsonion,1376820466,"http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html  &gt;  According to the Big Bang theory, the expansion of the observable universe began with the explosion of a single particle at a definite point in time. This startling idea first appeared in scientific form in 1931, in a paper by Georges Lemaître, a Belgian cosmologist and Catholic priest. The theory, accepted by nearly all astronomers today, was a radical departure from scientific orthodoxy in the 1930s. Many astronomers at the time were still uncomfortable with the idea that the universe is expanding. That the entire observable universe of galaxies began with a bang seemed preposterous.  &gt; In 1927, Lemaître published in Belgium a virtually unnoticed paper that provided a compelling solution to the equations of General Relativity for the case of an expanding universe. His solution had, in fact, already been derived without his knowledge by the Russian Alexander Friedmann in 1922. But Friedmann was principally interested in the mathematics of a range of idealized solutions (including expanding and contracting universes) and did not pursue the possibility that one of them might actually describe the physical universe. In contrast, Lemaître attacked the problem of cosmology from a thoroughly physical point of view, and realized that his solution predicted the expansion of the real universe of galaxies that observations were only then beginning to suggest.  &gt; By 1930, other cosmologists, including Eddington, Willem de Sitter, and Einstein, had concluded that the static (non-evolving) models of the universe they had worked on for many years were unsatisfactory. Furthermore, Edwin Hubble, using the world’s largest telescope at Mt. Wilson in California, had shown that the distant galaxies all appeared to be receding from us at speeds proportional to their distances. It was at this point that Lemaître drew Eddington’s attention to his earlier work, in which he had derived and explained the relation between the distance and the recession velocity of galaxies. Eddington at once called the attention of other cosmologists to Lemaître’s 1927 paper and arranged for the publication of an English translation. Together with Hubble’s observations, Lemaître’s paper convinced the majority of astronomers that the universe was indeed expanding, and this revolutionized the study of cosmology.  &gt; A year later, Lemaître explored the logical consequences of an expanding universe and boldly proposed that it must have originated at a finite point in time. If the universe is expanding, he reasoned, it was smaller in the past, and extrapolation back in time should lead to an epoch when all the matter in the universe was packed together in an extremely dense state. Appealing to the new quantum theory of matter, Lemaître argued that the physical universe was initially a single particle—the “primeval atom” as he called it—which disintegrated in an explosion, giving rise to space and time and the expansion of the universe that continues to this day. This idea marked the birth of what we now know as Big Bang cosmology.  &gt; This is an excerpt from COSMIC HORIZONS: ASTRONOMY AT THE CUTTING EDGE, edited by Steven Soter and Neil deGrasse Tyson, a publication of the New Press. © 2000 American Museum of Natural History.

I'm not quite sure what type of pictures you all want of Taeyeon, but I'll start with the ones I have saved on my pc.  The gallery I uploaded just now can be used as wallpapers if you wish. They are photos from various photoshoots.  A little bit of background about myself. I've been listening to k-pop in general since 2009, right around the time SNSD was wrapping up Genie promotions. At first, they all looked the same to me, and the two who caught my eye were Tiffany &amp; Jessica (of course the Americans). As I continued to watch Genie performances, I slowly started to differentiate and identify their different facial features. Next I liked Yuri and Yoona for a short moment. It was after I was curious to their personalities, I watched Intimate Note and my adoration for Taeyeon began. I remember my sister showing me a picture of Taeyeon prior to this and I just didn't like Taeyeon. Her eyebrows looked weird to me. However, I simply love everything about her now.  Her simple and timeless beauty, her child-like nature, her goofy mannerisms and every little thing about her, make her unique in my eyes.  I've watched you grow from a cute kid to a breath-taking woman. Taeyeon, you are my superstar.  I'm not sure if y'all feel the same way, but here is a song that best describes how I feel. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ_OE0wVUJI  Please enjoy everyone, and I am honored to provide you all will with beauty and grace that is Kim Taeyeon♥",♥

I hate saying 'I know what you're going through, I understand everything you feel and think' because I find it bollocks a lot of the time and I find it a bit condescending.   But I am a very good listener, and not someone who will tell you it's 'going to get better', or 'just cheer up', or 'try looking on the bright side, get some fresh air and admire the beauty of the world' bullshit. Because I know that motivational shit and those peptalks aren't worth jack-shit when you're depressed.  Long story short, I know you'll have had this offer countless times, but please message me anytime you want to, or you feel low. You don't even need to explain yourself, just tell me how you're feeling and rant and rave at me for a bit. Talking to random people on the internet is no miracle cure for depression, but I find it's a release, and the worst thing is to build it all up and talk to no-one.  Please message me, even off a throwaway account if you wish! I can't wait to listen ♥",♥

t5_2sq2y,HotHamWater,1376856642,"No biggie. If you're new to PC gaming all the different hardware can be a bit overwhelming, so I understand wanting to talk to people ""in the know""  From the [simplified rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/112ct1/psa_do_your_homework_also_simplified_rules_inside/) thread: &gt; * Anything that can easily be found with Google does not belong. &gt; * Newbie and low-end stuff goes in /r/buildapc    This sub is about high end PC hardware, not necessarily games that will run on your system. I suggested looking at the rules since this sub tends to be fairly heavily moderated. I'm not a mod, but it felt a bit off topic.  I Googled ""i5-3337U"" (after Googling your laptop model number) and went to [the info page for your CPU](http://ark.intel.com/products/72055/). Under ""Graphics specifications"" it lists your GPU as ""Intel® HD Graphics 4000"". I then Googled ""Intel® HD Graphics 4000 gaming"" and the first three results were these pages: [1](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1686074/intel-graphics-4000-gaming.html) [2](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/85285-35-graphic-memory-intel-4000-review-performance) [3](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000-Benchmarked.73567.0.html)  Thats a good starting point, but you really need to figure out what games you wanna play and either look up benchmarks or use Can You Run It.  *Edit: I just remembered that [the current Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) is loaded with fun games. You can use CYRI on these specific titles to give you an idea of your performance. If it looks like they'll run decently on your system, the bundle is amazingly cheap for what you get.",®
t5_2qh1i,EpicappleJuice,1376857079,"Chinese American here, this happens a lot in tourist heavy places like Washington dc or NYC. People usually get pissed off and try to them off but they usually just ignore and enjoy their new place in line. So being Chinese, I can get away with little rude things when they try to push their way in and they won't think too much of it. One example is one time I saw a Chinese tourist charge at the spot in front of me while I was stretching so I lowered my arms to where my elbow stuck out, don't really remember if it was on purpose on my part but he ran right into it and lost his place in line as well. I'm sure other people can do this as well but I think as a fellow Chinese person, I didn't sully my country's reputation for him as much 😄",😄

t5_2qixx,fixitben,1376858075,Sorry for the late response. There is a newly FDA approves braf inhibitor TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) which has shown some shinkage in body and brain tumors. I see he has taken mek which is usually combined with dabrafenib for greatest results. Another option would be yervoy (ipi) but that doesn't work to well on brain mets. Depending on how many brain Mets he has I would do gamma knife. Gamma knife is good for 3-4 brain Mets. Any more and whole brain radiation is pretty much the only option.  If he can get the brain stable then he can get into a anti pd1 trial or a ipi/anti pd1 trial. Which both of those have been showing great results for all types of melanoma. The part that sucks is pd1 is only available through trials right now. I am in the same boat as your friend. Currently zelboraf is working for me but I just don't know for how long. If you want to talk privately you can pm me.,®

t5_2qqdd,jsled,1376875058,"Hill Farmstead is one of the best breweries in the world. Period. He is, simply, at the top of his game.  It's nearly two hours out of town, and another two hour wait in line once you get there.  But, if you don't already know all that, I'd skip it.  Instead, head to Waterbury and plan to spend a good long afternoon/evening as you bounce between Prohibition Pig, Blackback and the Reservoir, all w/in a block of each other, and all serving some of the finest beers around, and with excellent food to boot.  However, if you do head up to Greensboro, you'll probably pass through Morrisville, in which case you should hit up Lost Nation and Rock Art, if you have the time.  In Burlington, The Farmhouse has the best taps around, and good food.  Vermont Pub and Brewer is an icon, just around the corner.  And just one block away is American Flatbread, which has great food, and their attached Zero Gravity brewery is quite solid, as well.  Down Shelburne road is Magic Hat, but further down into Shelburne itself is Fiddlehead, which is in the same building as a pizza place; buy beer in the former, walk it over to the latter to enjoy. :)  Just outside of Burlington is Winooski, home to the excellent Mule Bar, as well as the Winooksi Beverage Warehouse, where you can stuff your suitcase for the return trip.  If you're closer to Montpelier, seek out Three Penny Taproom for an excellent draft selection and good food.  If you're in the southern part of the state, you've got great options between Bobcat Cafe for great food and beer, Drop-In Brewery for a tasting, Otter Creek and Long Trail for traditional crafty production breweries, and Whetstone Station in the SE corner of the state.   VT ♥ craft beer and those who enjoy craft beer.  Enjoy your stay, and I'm happy to clarify or add more detail.  Na Zadrowie!",♥

t5_2qi50,catlaw,1376885245,"I ♥ the worldbuilding thought you put into this!  I don't have a prethought upper $$$ cap: in some cases I know it's resourceful to modify cheaper garments to get 80-90% of the way there. But I'm just doing a lot of searching to know what already exists. I'm willing to invest in ""buy it for life""-quality garments that I'll enjoy for years to come. As for fabrics, I don't have predefined notions (I'm not too knowledgeable on this front) but I prefer silk, cotton, polyester — non-itchy (aka not wool!) materials.  I hadn't thought that far ahead (trying to bridge various text and in-game visuals with real-world constructed fashion). Yes, ""slight build"" works for me. Yes, I think of ""classic"" locations in cyberpunk like: Seattle, Berlin, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong where there is possibly a big divide between rich/poor. Other titles that have inspired me include Shadowrun, Syndicate, Strange Days — and I also imagine what trendsetters like Miami Vice and Mad Men would look like if placed in the future.  Although he's more on the side that opposes established power structures, I really like the contrast between red and black that [Julian Assange wears](http://i.imgur.com/5C0vnLE.png).  With ""future CEO"" and such I'm thinking of a more subtle extrapolation of current fashions. Something like a suit with slightly reflective pinstripe/circuit board/abstract/floral patterns, for instance. Or even familiar forms with color schemes that are uncommon (like how DX:HR uses black/gold, or Tron: Legacy delves into blue/orange). So enough to stand out, but not ""way crazy"" out there.

t5_2qm4e,elitism254,1376893573,"This topic is absolutely fascinating. I'm really impressed by some of the results here. I'd like to start off by posting some more meta observations:   1. Finding out if something works as a deterrent is like trying to find out how to stop people torrenting. I won't entertain this analogy too much, but I hope you get my drift. The only real effective method is a large scale study of the people who have successfully burgled homes and been deterred by others.  Even finding these people will be skewwed as the easiest source is prison - and you'll only be dealing with people that were caught, or caught for other offences. Therefore, I'd go so far as to say that not only has a peer reviewed study not ever been done, but that it would be very resource intensive to do, and you'd still be getting skewwed results. As one user pointed out, even the police and insurance information claims are useless as they only contain information where deterrents didn't work. **In short - there is no study and one is unlikely to come soon.**   2. Dogs work, dogs don't work. Using spiked fences worked, no use open spaces so they feel uncomfortable. Use cameras, don't use cameras - criminals don't care. Ultimately, any studies into one particular methodology of deterring people will be extremely biased as the pool will either be too small (30 criminals? ... need a lot more than that) or a huge number of factors could influence the outcome. How useful is video surveillance in the slums of detroit vs. in large houses in LA? You could do the same study to 2000 people and have completely opposite results. **Any ""factual"" information supporting or denying one particular method of preventing burglary is biased.**   3. Is CCTV worth it to prosecute a burglar? The answer is a resounding maybe. The legal system requires a human opinion and nothing is certain in court. Lets say you payed the extra money and had a huge amount of high res cameras covering all over the house AND you managed to capture a high res picture of the person's face? What happens if your DNA samples come back as tampered with, incomplete or just aren't taken at all? What if they leave almost no evidence? Even if you had DNA + a high res image of the person's face, there will still be an actual person deciding whether the thief you've photographed and have a DNA sample is going to get locked up. Even then, they might be stealing because they're so poor they can't afford it and you get nothing back after having them locked up (which for some would be a win). /u/Dug_Fin makes a very good argument around the technical nature of positioning cameras but I think the argument against them covers much more ground.  #I guess, that's where my observations from this thread ends, and I go into my own suggestion:  Talk to people who repair the damage caused by breakins (locksmiths / glass fitters / etc). As anectdotal as it may be, I keep in regular contact with a locksmith and he's a fantastic fountain of information around what doesn't stop intruders. I recognise this is the same trap as the one I mentioned earlier (biased information from one source). [edit: I wanted to add that I trust the laymen as their explanations are often simple and make sense. This allows me to make an intuitive decision without relying on third party information as they can literally go ""look here, this is where the lock snapped after being kicked. Don't trust locks made by Generacorp™.""]   I think as you're only going to get opinion based evidence anyway; don't look for a study answering a specific angle of the problem, try and gather information and make an informed decision - specifically around how to prevent this happening again and not something as narrow as  ""Does CCTV work?"". Because you will definitely find evidence supporting both sides of the fence to that question and be forced to make a decision based on opinions anyway. IMO, the less interaction with sales people the better as they will be pushing for a sale (and their studies will be extremely biased anyway).",™

A combination of air-cooled and precision liquid cooling strategies allow the Twin-Cooled High Output 103 to maintain peak performance under the most demanding loads and riding conditions, and enables a higher 10.1:1 compression ratio for increased power and efficiency. The Twin-Cooled High Output 103 offers 10.7 percent more peak torque than the standard Twin Cam 103 engine. Liquid coolant is routed through the cylinder heads in the area around the exhaust valves and then to ducted heat exchangers located in the left and right fairing lowers. The precision cooling system is thermostatically controlled, and uses an electric pump to circulate coolant. The Twin-Cooled High Output 103 may also improve thermal comfort to the rider and passenger in extreme conditions, such as stop-and-go traffic in high ambient temperatures. Cylinder head temperatures are lower, the airbox shape improves airflow, and reshaped fairing lowers improve venting of air to the rider and passenger.",™

t5_2qhfb,deong,1376925813,"OK, so I'm a PhD working in machine learning in the middle of a big group of ""Strong AI"" folks (though they prefer the term AGI these days -- Artificial *General* Intelligence). I don't really consider myself an ""AI guy"", but maybe I'm close enough.  First, I encourage you to look into a few other sources. The physicist Roger Penrose wrote a pretty famous book arguing essentially exactly what you're saying -- human consciousness cannot be algorithmic in the Turing machine sense. There are two divergent paths one could take from there -- dualism (the mind is, for lack of a better word, supernatural), or that there is some super-Turing, but still physical, computation required, such as quantum indeterminacy. Penrose and yourself both fall into that second camp. Penrose is a brilliant physicist, and I really do encourage you to read the book (The Emperor's New Mind). He also wrote a follow-up book called Shadows of the Mind that makes much the same argument, only using Gödel's theorem rather than physics to stake his claim on. However, there are [a](http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~llandau/Homepage/Math/penrose.html) [lot](http://hanson.gmu.edu/penrose.html) [of](http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/nnp/17540.html) [rebuttals](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/reviews/penrose1/penrose1.html) [out](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~bukatin/reading_penrose.html) [there](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~neto/books/Penrose_rebuttal.html) [too](http://www.calculemus.org/MathUniversalis/NS/10/09mcdermott.html). Read some of those as well. Being popular doesn't make you right, but essentially everyone who works in cognitive science or AI thinks Penrose gets it wrong, so do read some of their arguments as well.  OK. So my own interpretation here will be less formal and rigorous and a bit more off the cuff. The major issue with your post is that it's one giant conjecture with not even a whiff of supporting evidence. You've basically said, ""I don't understand how creativity/intelligence/consciousness works, therefore magic."" There's no falsifiable theory being put forth here. You can't point to any one thing that a classical brain cannot do; only a bunch of things that you don't know how a classical brain can do. As a hypothesis, that's perfectly fine, but the great thing about guesses is that anyone can pull one out of their ass without too much difficulty. The hard part is convincing anyone you're right.   Granted, testing that is going to be Hard™. So sometimes we have to take the next best thing and argue from plausibility, which is more or less what you're doing in the post. I get the need to do that, but I don't think the evidence is nearly as strong as you think it is. You're a programmer -- you've no doubt written code that did something different than what you expected it to do (we lovingly call them ""bugs""). You can take an extremely simple program, throw fuzz testing at it, and have a decent chance at seeing something unexpected. And yet we're somehow surprised that something as complicated as a brain dealing with inputs as complex as the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, and internal stimuli that those brains encounter at a sample rate of billions of inputs per day would somehow produce unexpected results sometimes?  Go play around with the [Genetic Algorithm 2D Car Thingy](http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/) for a while. You'll probably find that it generates quite a few creative looking cars. My point here is not to argue that such a simple system is *actually* creative or intelligent. Rather, I want to argue that much of what we do is not much more than an embodiment of the old canard, ""AI is whatever we don't know how to do yet."" If a human built a crazy car that actually worked, we'd call it creative, but because we know how a GA works and we know that it's a stupid little trick at heart, we say, ""well...that's not *real* creativity.""  Basically my argument is that it's much more probable that there **is** a completely classical (massively parallel and distributed, but perfectly capable of classical simulation) process by which brains give birth to minds, and we simply don't know what it is yet. We are the products of evolution, and it shows. Very little is elegantly simple. Life is bodged together just well enough to work, and my own suspicion (just as much conjecture as yours, by the way) is that asking for there to be a simple and comprehensible algorithm underlying human intelligence is being greedy. We have no reason to expect to be able to point to a simple algorithm. I fully expect intelligence, consciousness, creativity, etc. to be a steaming mess of spaghetti that somehow still works, but resists just about any effort to reduce it to simple parts, and it is precisely that mystery that leads us to think of it as being somehow beyond understanding in a much grander sense. I can't understand source code written by one other person last year half the time. I see no surprise in not understanding the algorithms coded by 3.5 billion years worth of very stupid programmers working in an extremely low-level and constantly changing language I've only just begun to learn how to read.

t5_2qgzg,clavalle,1376936555,"You are right in the sense that it did very little to attack the cost problem.  But I think it will lead to a single-payer system and I think the people fighting it are accelerating the pace for when it gets there.  And once there is a single payer the insurance companies are pushed into the supplemental niche and the drug companies and hospitals will have to dance to the single payer tune.  Here is how it will play out:  ☑ A bunch of Governors will refuse to implement the insurance exchanges  ☑ So the Federal Government will do it for them  ☑ Insurance companies will be on these Federally created exchanges that cover all of these uncooperative States. (This is important because there will be less fragmentation in the exchanges set up by the Feds).  ☑ Businesses, especially those that have low paid workers, will pay fees rather than offer insurance to their employees or get their employees to work less than 30 hours/wk.  ☐ These employees will pick the cheap insurance from these exchanges.  ☐ One or two of the companies will start to run away with a huge number of enrollees because of the way insurance works. They have more enrollees, so risk is spread, so they can offer lower rates so they will get more enrollees etc.  ☐ After a few years between one and three companies will come out as winners after this process plays out.  ☐ The Federal Government will bless one or more of these winners as the Federal Option.  ☐ The virtuous cycle accelerates. Other insurance companies begin to die or are merged.  ☐ Once one of these companies reaches critical mass and becomes the de facto Public Option, the government will begin to get more and more involved until it is a quasi public institution or fully absorbed into the government.  ☐ At this point it becomes The Single Payer. All other players might still exist but are pushed into small niches.",☑

You can be useful if you try, which we see now especially when Keima is stuck with Haqua, so, how about some driving lessons and getting that fire engine? :)  Keima, who has the fortitude to sit through and do nothing but play dozens of dating-games simultaneously for many hours is on the floor, out of energy? Impossibru! Time to work on your other-form of constitution, Keima-kun, you can't resemble Lelouch in everything, you know.  Silly Keima, you're being a tsundere to a tsundere, this is just going to have her blood boil over and now she is *sure* to come. The sickness must indeed be getting to you, and the need to keep skipping between girls, though all your past training has you juggling multiple girls simultaneously, but never on-screen.  Katsuragi, you're over-selling it, now we have to deal with little-sister-chan (Suguha x Kirino max!). Man, that crawling up the stairs. There is such a thing as overselling things. This is already miles beyond.  Ok, that cup drop, if it's been intentional, was masterfully done. That's what we're talking about. I guess you had to use brute force to set up the situation where you can use the more subtle stuff. BTW, it's all backwards - as Keima explained, a house-visit shows you if a girl's level is high enough, but here he forces the house-visit in order for the level to be that high retroactively. This is actually very fitting for the way humans behave, where they act, and then retroactively justify it, or when they make a justification for something they use it to retroactively explain past actions which had truly been unexplored, motivation-wise.  Keima, I never knew you had it in you, to throw someone onto bed like this. I think he'll burn up for real afterwards, even without Ayumi lighting the fuse herself.  Keima blushing shouldn't be surprising to anyone - remember when I said it seems he's truly falling for Yui two weeks ago, and for Shiori last week? Keima falls in love with all of the girls in his dating games, so we really shouldn't be surprised he has an easy time falling ifor girls, multiple ones, even, he basically conditioned himself to be so, or is it that this nature of him made him play all these games?   That Keima-blush™! I wonder if it's just blood filling his mouth from biting his tongue, well, I'm just being mean. He's being very cute lately.",™

t5_2qqqf,ThatGrumpyGoat,1376941402,"I deal with depression (comes and goes but can last for years at a time) and my SO has bipolar II (her meds are better at preventing mania than depression).  We got together 7 months ago.  She was open about the BPD among our friends; I mentioned  my depression when we got together.  Based on her disclosure, this didn't bother her.  To echo what others have said, **communication is key.**  I'm not sure where you're coming from and whether discussion of depression is taboo.  (I'm a grad student and almost everyone I work with is on psych meds; discussion's not a big deal here.)  You'll probably need to tell her at some point if the relationship continues.  This is a risk; she might not react well and that will hurt. (Understatement of century.)  You could test the waters by bringing up mental illness in a neutral conversation and seeing how she reacts.  Try not to be emotional when you raise the subject.  Express your concerns about the relationship, but be matter-of-fact and don't present them as The Truth™.  It was difficult for SO and me at first - we tried to be supportive when the other seemed really down.  Then we got comfortable asking and *honestly* answering question like ""How are you feeling right now?"" and ""Is there anything in particular bothering you?"" and talking through things together.  It took out the guesswork and made it easier to provide support.  Asides:  If you're the kind of person she wants and vice versa, you deserve each other.  The low self-worth that comes with depression is your scumbag brain; she's not out of your league, you're not worthless, and you're not wasting her time.  (Even if that sounds  untrue to you.)  At the same time, relationships don't  cure depression.  I started my relationship 6 months into a bout of depression; I'm now on month 13.  It doesn't fix the problem, but time spent together eases the pain. I find that even when I'm hiding it, people close to me pick up on my depressive states. If you tell her, you'll help her understand your behavior and ease her worry.  **TL;DR:** Tell her what you're going through.  Don't leave her to worry over the small emotional cues you can't hide.  Mention your fears about hurting her/wasting her time, but *listen* to her when she offers alternative interpretations of the relationship.  She may sound disgustingly optimistic, but she's not the depressed one and her optimism may be more realistic than your own thoughts on the matter.  EDIT: Are you pursuing any course of treatment?",™

t5_2s7yr,offtherocks,1376952514,"This is a tough question to answer, because I don't feel like I use a ""method"" on a day-to-day basis.  I don't wake up each day and think, ""I'm not going to drink today, and here are the things I'm going to do to accomplish that goal."" Thoughts of drinking rarely enter my mind.  Some of that may be due to the lifestyle changes I've made.    * I participate here each day, and I participate in the IRC channel.  I don't do this because I feel it helps my sobriety. I'm not saying it doesn't, I'm saying that I don't do it for that reason. I do it because enjoy it.  I like helping out, and I consider many of the people I've come to know as friends.  * I bike, run, or lift weights nearly every day. Again, not because I think ""If I don't exercise I'll drink,"" but because it's become part of my lifestyle.  There was a time late last year where I skipped a few days of exercise and felt out of sorts. I was wary of it leading to relapse, because I was able to recognize some of the feelings - anxiety, unrest, unease - and knew that they are often associated with relapse.  I just didn't feel like ""myself,"" ya know? I know that that's how a relapse often starts, so I don't mean to sound like I'm dismissing it.  It's just not how I think about it. I don't relate everything in my life to alcohol or the absence of alcohol.  When I feel ""not right"" because I haven't been exercising, I chalk it up to not exercising. Not some brain disorder that's pulling me back into drinking.   * I try to eat well. I've been doing a pretty poor job of this lately, to tell you the truth. But I know enough to know that what I put into my body has a lot to do with my well being.   * I avoid caffeine. I quit caffeine before I quit drinking. Caffeine makes me anxious. I don't like being anxious.   * I don't hang out in bars or attend activities where the primary purpose is drinking.  I don't feel like I'm missing out by skipping these activities, I'm genuinely not interested.  Those activities seem dull.   I would have answered this question differently 1 year ago.  I think that's important to say.  It's important for you to realize that I didn't just quit drinking &amp; immediately start thinking differently™. It took time. There was a lot of work &amp; some struggle along the way.   Here is something that I think is true for everyone with a X days or more (arbitrary number) of sobriety, not just me:  We're not the best people to ask about our daily methods or mindset.  Because those things change over time, and we don't fully remember the early days.  For example, I know I spent a lot of time going on walks while listening to audio books.  I did this because it gave me something to do, let me get some exercise, and helped me not think about drinking.  Once, someone asked me how long I did that for. I said ""Oh, about a month.""  But then I checked my Audible purchase history - I was doing that for at least three months.  But I don't remember it that way. I remember doing it for a month, I remember it being so easy.  ""Yeah, get an audio book and go for a walk, simple solution you dummy!""  But it's not that simple. And it sure wasn't easy at the time.  It was a struggle for me.  I can't fully appreciate the struggle you're feeling because my own struggle is so removed from my mind.  I mean, I remember that I struggled, but I don't remember what it felt like to struggle, you know what I mean?  It's a bit like asking Bill Gates what it feels like to be rich, or how he got rich.  Yeah, he's been successful, so his opinions are definitely something you should consider.  But what's he going to say?  ""Lot of hard work. Lot of late nights. Do whatever it takes.""  Well no kidding, billg. That's just not a very helpful answer. You'd be much better off asking someone who's going through the process at the same time you are, or someone just a little bit ahead of you. It's fresher in that person's mind, so they can better relate to you on an emotional level.  Bill Gates might say ""Work hard,"" but some guy who's just a little bit ahead of you could say ""Yeah, the hard work sucks, I know, but it's necessary. I know exactly how you're feeling, I was feeling that way just a couple months ago.  Here's how I got through it.""  Since you asked for ""any advice,"" here's what I would recommend:  Read as many old posts as you can. You don't have to wait for new ones, there are two years of history here. Immerse yourself in them.  See what works for people and what doesn't. Apply what you learn to your own life.  Don't discount something because you don't care for the source, keep an open mind.  Become friendly with people who are right around the same # days as you are.  Help each other. Draw support from each other.  Listen to the old timers here, they have plenty of experience and give excellent advice, but realize that they don't fully relate to what you're going through on an emotional level. They can't. It's just too far removed their mind.  Find someone a couple of months ahead of you and follow that person's lead.  They're the ones who will guide you to where you want to be, not the people who are already there.",™

One day about four or five kids were ganging up on him, making fun of his shirt and about to throw hands at him.

t5_2qkt4,kbrugger,1376965822,"I get your point. Practicality takes priority over any other kind of fancy training, I agree. So yes, one should train for situations that are most likely to arise...   However, the reality is that  situations of true danger are always unknown situations. That moment when your life is on the edge is something that you will never be _prepared_ for. Although it's not that easy to believe, training the ""inconceivable"" does something to your skills. Since in martial arts you're not training to replicate the techniques in a real life situation (I think they won't work that way), you train instead to cultivate a feeling, a feeling of perception and flow, a feeling of heightened awareness that allows you to instinctively move through the unknown.   Maybe it sounds too mystical, but it's not. Techniques are excercises, they're not something you are memorizing to repeat in a given situation, since that ""given"" situation will never happen exactly as you know it. What you're looking for is to develop an instinctive skill to react accordingly to any situation of danger, with an empty mind. That's why I believe that training in every possible way is extremely beneficial.  Anyway, feel free to disagree, since I'm not talking about The Truth™ of martial arts, I'm just talking about the way I train... For example, I train unarmed combat, but I also train with different weapons, including sword techniques. Now, why on earth do I train with swords? No one will ever attack me with a sword and I will never be carrying my katana on the street. Well, it doesn't matter, because I know everything is an excercise for my awareness, an awareness that belongs to the body. So besides the practical training, I also try to put myself in seemingly impossible situations, not because I'm expecting those situations to arise, but because I'm not expecting absolutely anything specific to arise... Besides, training with swords is _very_ much fun. :)",™

t5_mouw,mubukugrappa,1376967000,"ERK and AKT Signaling Drive MED1 Overexpression in Prostate Cancer in Association with Elevated Proliferation and Tumorigenicity  http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/11/7/736  Abstract  MED1 is a key coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) and other signal-activated transcription factors. Whereas MED1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines and is thought to coactivate distinct target genes involved in cell-cycle progression and castration-resistant growth, the underlying mechanisms by which MED1 becomes overexpressed and its oncogenic role in clinical prostate cancer have remained unclear. Here, we report that MED1 is overexpressed in the epithelium of clinically localized human prostate cancer patients, which correlated with elevated cellular proliferation. In a Nkx3.1:Pten mutant mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates the human disease, MED1 protein levels were markedly elevated in the epithelium of both invasive and castration-resistant adenocarcinoma prostate tissues. Mechanistic evidence showed that hyperactivated ERK and/or AKT signaling pathways promoted MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer cells. Notably, ectopic MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer xenografts significantly promoted tumor growth in nude mice. Furthermore, MED1 expression in prostate cancer cells promoted the expression of a number of novel genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and survival. Together, these findings suggest that elevated MED1 is a critical molecular event associated with prostate oncogenesis. Mol Cancer Res; 11(7); 736–47. ©2013 AACR. ",©

t5_2r4cj,nail1r,1376980630,"Hello Mike!  Few questions:  1.	Why don’t you stream your gaming sessions? You’d have tons of viewers. Plus I miss seeing Mike Ross-content ☺ 2.	Why do you think Honda is a bad character? He has great normals, solid damage, invincible reversals that are safe on block, good mobility, good air-to-airs. Would you be fine if they’d buff his damage, increase the invincibility on EX Headbutt, but made every reversal he has punishable on block? And I’m not talking about the lame -2 that buttslam is, but properly unsafe. 3.	What are your future/present plans concerning gaming content production? Is there anything in the works? 4.	Why haven’t you learned frame data in SF4? I think it puts you at a disadvantage that would be so easy to fix. I was surprised when you found out from gootecks during an Excellent Adventure that you can’t safejump Ryu (eventhough you had a pretty convincing whiffed normal before you jumped). 5.	How many tournaments did it take for you to not mess up something due to nerves? I’ve taken part in a few, and dropped stuff like ultras when I’ve gotten the opponent stunned. 6.	What are your thoughts on the ongoing ”collusion” (i hate the word)? I remember that you were also once part of a small ”collusion”, eventhough that was planned to BUILD hype, not destroy it.  Finally I just wanted to say that you really seem like such a great guy, and I’m amazed how you continue to be it eventhough your every FG friend makes an ass of himself at some point, except you. Watson is right, you’re the most loveable person in the FGC! ",☺

Halfway down I say  &gt;  There's always an excuse but it comes down to I don't care enough to fix it.  I actually agree with you on most of the points. I will not lose weight until I decide to do something about it.  It boils down to this: I'm really not that unhappy being fat. Being thin would be nice but it's not the priority it really should be. I don't complain about being fat. I know exactly why I'm fat and what needs to be done to fix it.  Also, I've got awesome friends and family that will promptly call me on my shit if ever got the thought to complain. I refuse to be friends with anyone that is accepting of FatLogic™. I've got enough problems without adding that to my life. I surround myself with good people. They would be supporting of any diet I would try but they are all too distant for anything beyond a phone call. They do ask me about my weight from time to time but they aren't pushy. Bless them, they care.  My goal with this move is to try to reset my eating habits.   Now I have a chance to leave all of the food I have stocked behind and start a completely new life in a new city. I'm hopeful but living out of a hotel room for 2 weeks could do a lot of damage if I'm not careful.   You're right that the restaurants don't encourage me to pig out. What I meant to convey is I would avoid restaurants that make self-control more difficult for me, like buffets. Until I fix my self-control, all kinds of places need to be off limits. The last year has been spent learning how to notice bad situations and avoid getting into them. It's time to put that into practice.  You give me a lot of hope that I can make. You made it under circumstances that are probably much harder than mine. :)   ",™

I was running at 80% out of 200% CPU (apparently there's two cores in the control panel so it's 100% each). It has been working flawless. My first host experience was ClanForge (Multiplay) and I used it for about 2 months but it's a bit expensive for a few player slots. It was good but it's not good enough for FTB for the price.  I switched to CreeperHost after and I hated it immediately. We were lagging badly when we transferred the world over to Creeperhost from Clanforge. I made the ticket to the support center from Creeperhost and they asked us to run speedtest.net and give them the result. Nonsense, we knew it's not our end and they won't move to another server or anything like that. We were using Zombie Plan. So I decided to switch to Hosthorde and it's unbelievable for it's performance and price.   Here's the plan I'm using for HostHorde  - Up to 100 player slots - 10 GB SSD (You can ask for more when it's full) - Dual-Core Intel® Xeon® processor - Unlimited RAMS (Up to 8GB and will increase when you ask them for more) - Decent server locations - Access to a simple control panel and FTP  For only 24.99 a month and you can see other plans http://www.hosthorde.com/plans/ but I think Ultimate plan is the best for FTB with lots of players.",®

I'm even awake early today as I am most days to hit the gym to look all buff..... I am trying everything!!!!   This is what leads people to suicide and while I've considered it in my younger years, it hasn't passed my mind these days. This is why it happens though.   My mom is a young widow now as my father passed 2 years ago by sudden death.   I have no one to consult... Therapists are so $$$$....   :( :( :( I appreciate everyone responses as it gives me insight from different angles.    ",😁

t5_2w7lx,eve-throwaway3483,1377017420,"&gt; Does Mining and Industry mix? I know training both would help me keep costs down, but is it worth the time it takes to train since the skills don't overlap?  It doesn't *not* mix.  Just avoid the ""minerals I mine are free"" trap.  An industrialist should be able to profit working entirely from minerals bought off market.  &gt; Other than PE5, what skills should an Industrialist be looking into, and in what order?  Industry 5, Mass Production, Laboratory Operation if you're doing any researching.  &gt; Would it be more convenient to not join BNI (and just get Blued to the alliance), base my alt out of Stac, and train... Jump Freighters?... to hop back and forth from Stac to Barle?  We no longer blue hauling alts, so your personal hauler would best be in-corp if you're servicing Barleguet.^1  I'm sure an exception would definitely be made for a Jump Freighter character, especially if you also do some hauling for your alliancemates.  We really need more Jump Freighters.  They are however a 7 billion isk ship that will take you months to train, you sure that's what you want to do?  If you're a newbie that's more of a long-term goal.  &gt; Does an Industrialist typically need a research POS to do decent work?  You can do just fine without it, and should in fact not have one to start.  A POS takes fuel 24/7 whether you're using it or not, so unless you have a big enough operation to fully utilize the research slots it won't be cost effective.  I think GPP-L has a research POS its members share, and Ender Blue sells researched BPCs for crazy-low prices.  ^1 Technically, I'd recommend two hauling characters.  One in NPC corp to get things to/from Stacmon, and your BNI main to run Stacmon ↔ Barleguet.  You want to be flying different ships for each leg anyway: in highsec maximize ehp, in lowsec go for agility and if using T1 industrials the powergrid to cloak+MWD.",↔

Most of the time, she's convinced racism - whether institutionalized or individualized - is this whole, large, immobile *thing* that can only be done by white males.  Then, when cases emerge where people of different profiles emerge at the top (e.g. Sonia Sotomayor) her ideals switch, and it becomes this whole crusade of ""keeping white power in check with the power we've earned"". Flippity switch: suddenly, The White People™ are oppressing her whenever someone disagrees with Sotomayor or other personalities, and obviously if you disagree with a latina or black person, you must be racist.

t5_2trms,TeaEyeM,1377025827,"In a previous game i also played a Monk of irori, here is a copy of my code along and some things i had said to other party members or npc's we had faced...   ▪ As food nourishes my body, knowledge nourishes my soul.  ▪ My body is my greatest possession; through it all things are possible.  ▪ Where I have no emotion, I have clarity,  ▪ I shall show mercy, but I shall expect it from none.  ▪ Truth is immortal, and through it, I am as well.  ▪ I do not wish it easier, I wish myself better.  ▪ To the vices of men I shall not faultier, for through purity I am whole.  ▪ To err is human; I grant forgiveness to all who seek it.  ▪ My success is not final, my failure is not fatal. My courage to carry on is what defines me.  ▪ I am content to be myself, through this I have earned all the respect I require.   “I am not going to kill you, for your demise would bring me no joy, and your survival no harm. I suggest you leave and never return. If you do not heed my suggestion, and warn your masters of my presence, know that I will not care, but this mercy will not befall you once more. Rethink the choices you have made in your life, and think even harder on those you are about to make, for they very well may be your last.”   “What have these men done to deserve death? Certainly they have made some poor decisions in their life, but they are doing nothing more then following the orders of those who they believe are right. Cleric, I ask you if Iomedae appeared and told you to spare this man, would you? What if he told you to kill people whom you have never met and who you could not know their disgressions? Would that be any different than what this man has done? He is simply following orders. Our gripe is not with him, but his masters. Men can change; if he does not then you have my permission to do with him what you please. Spare his life or I may begin to question if I myself have fallen in with the wrong crowd.”   “Rogue, you seem motivated by your own gains. I know not why you journey with us, and I do not care why, but I ask you; what do you gain from murder? The benefits of letting this man live would greatly outweigh the risks. You seem so set on killing anyone who has wronged you, while I do admire your strength and persistence, I feel that teaching those men a lesson and letting them live could be far more beneficial to you. The reputation you would gain would be that of fear and respect, rather than fear and hate. Let your enemies know that it is not wise to cross you, but spare them forgiveness when it is necessary.”",▪

Some, hardly exhaustive, examples help to set the scene. Facebook credits and BitCoins are attempts to create common tenders for virtual communities. Facebook is tied to its social network while BitCoins are intended to be used across communities. Linden dollars (Second Life) have an exchange rate with sovereign currency. Ven (Hub Culture) is attempting to move a community currency into the physical world as well, with physical trading ‘pavilions’. The Ven is listed on Thomson Reuters’ trading screens.   There are common tender initiatives not tied to capacity exchanges or online communities, such as the WOCU®, a currency basket derivative of 16 sovereign currencies weighted by the GDP of the top 20 nations. WOCU® are used, though not widely, in some commodity transactions. To date, there is no global common tender. Proponents of global common tender often claim that it would not only underpin multilateral reciprocal trade but also provide a unit with less exchange rate volatility against goods and services.

t5_2fwo,Veedrac,1377028310,"&gt;or are you just ranting because of the title?  I'm afraid you must be missing the points I'm attempting to make if they seem that shallow... Well, no-one said communicating over the internet was easy.  I'll try and write this out in a few more words. Just say if my point isn't clear.   &gt;His point is that modern Javascript alone provides the abstractions that jQuery provides.  I didn't get that vibe at all. He said  &gt;Modern web browsers can do most of what you want from jQuery, without jQuery.  This is true because jQuery uses the same interface below the hood. In fact by this measure it *has* to be true. He even says as much.  He translates this jQuery:      $('div.article p').addClass('test');  to      var items = document.querySelectorAll('div.article p');     for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++)         items[i].classList.add('test');  I don't believe this supports your statement that  &gt;modern Javascript alone provides the abstractions that jQuery provides  because jQuery is providing automatic elementwise operations. With Javascript you have to ""unpack"" the logic of the jQuery. This is like ""unpacking"" the logic of a higher-level language when using a lower-level one. You *can*, but *why would you*?  Sure the C ↔ Assembly is a more exaggerated version but I don't believe it removes the main point.  ---  I understand the second example does give a similar level of abstraction, but the point ""*why would you*?"" still stands without it.  ---  I think his third example is a bit nonsense, so I'm going to ignore it unless prompted.  ---  His final example has the first abstraction lost (elementwise operations) and a new one - `.remove` now works through `this.parentElement.removeChild`. This is an important difference not just because it's in a new place but because it removes logic from the original program (remove semantics, not just syntax).  ---  His last paragraph deserves quoting.  &gt;I feel like adding jQuery is one of the first things a web developer does to their shiny new website. It just isn’t really necessary in this day and age.  Srsly? jQuery is archaic so you want to move to pure Javascript?  &gt;That extra request, 91kb, and load time are probably negligible,  *Are* negligible if you used cached sources as you should be.  &gt;but it’s still a little less clean than it could be.  Wut?  &gt;There’s no need to go back and rid all of your projects of jQuery, but I’d suggest that for your next one, you try to do without.  Why? Because I can?  &gt;Keep MDN open in the next tab over and I’m sure you’ll get through it fine.  I'm sure I would. But why would I want to?  ---  Finally, I feel the C ↔ Assembly analogy is made *more* apt by the loss of automatic portability that the higher-level abstraction gives, whether or not you believe the loss is ""acceptable"".",↔

t5_2tx47,bridget1989,1377029542,"Lulu is a white husky and Kim is a German shepherd. Kim is my roommate's dog. They were both rescues. I got Lulu in February from a local shelter. I started off ""just looking,"" as my roommate at the time (a different one) had a dog, and we thought it might be nice for her to get a playmate, but I was NOT serious about buying her. Then I laid eyes on her, and I was pretty much done for.  When I brought her home, I had a day off of work with her, and then I had to leave and kennel her while I was at work. SHE BROKE OUT OF THE KENNEL AND DESTROYED MY EVERLIVING POSSESSION! I was so mad. I sat on my bed and CRIED, asking myself if I had made a terrible mistake. But with lots and lots of work, and tons and tons of training, she is now the perfect animal for me. She's spunky, FULL of personality, very stubborn, she moans loudly at me when I'm keeping her up too late watching TV, she makes friends easily, but people and dog, she is a total goofball and never fails to make someone laugh with her stupid behavior...She's pretty much the best thing to ever have happened to me!  ♥ ♥ ♥  Photo spread:  * My dogs starring in ""[The Cheer Up Committee](http://imgur.com/a/SFUnW)""  * [Hipster Lulu](http://imgur.com/N4kig55)  * Lulu in [booty shorts](http://imgur.com/N4kig55) and a [sports bra](http://imgur.com/v9ZJbtY)  * Lulu with a [large toy she was gifted](http://imgur.com/UsuOnOD)  * [Compilation photo, with one of Lulu's silly upside down faces!](http://imgur.com/yVJqTJf)  * The girls, [relaxing together](http://imgur.com/QQNBwU9)  THANKS for the CONTEST, nice friend! ♥ And I have MANY pet items on my wishlist!",♥

I present the following following question, then answer it.  ---  Q: Well, but email is sent in the clear, surely it was already captured before it was encrypted by Lavabit?   A: In many cases yes, but other services like Google Mail will attempt to send mail over SMTP encrypted, if the other service supports it, and Lavabit did support it. Therefore Gmail ↔ Lavabit SMTP transactions would have been encrypted. If work under the below assumptions, compliance would be required by either Google or Lavabit in order to nab Gmail ↔ Lavabit emails.  The assumptions:  * Google does not send all email to federal agencies. * The secured SMTP connections were not subject to downgrade attacks.",↔

t5_2qgzt,BIO_Wolf,1377039750,"`&gt;run Steam and some games.`  In the video, we see the Cintiq Companion advertising its stand (keep it stable while drawing), pen case (different tips for different drawing tools), and the quote ""Make Your World Your Studio""; obviously the Cintiq is intended for portable graphical purposes rather than the regular consumer, especially with such a huge price tag. I doubt if anyone would purchase a drawing tablet for that price that they will be using it for gaming.   Nevertheless, doesn't the [Cintiq Companion](http://asset1.cbsistatic.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim2/2013/08/19/DTHW1300_White_RGB_610x407.jpg) look very familiar to the [Cintiq 13HD](http://store.wacom.com/us/en/product/DTK1300?)? Both the screen resolution, pressure sensitivity and button location suggest that Wacom took the Cintiq 13HD and simply placed a normal tablet computer behind it. Is it justifiable for a person to pay an additional $600 to make their Cintiq 13HD into a tablet computer?  As for myself, I will stick to my Portege M200. While it is not up to par to the Cintiq Companion in all aspects, at least I have myself a Cintiq like display without paying $1000.   *edit:* So I was right about the Cintiq Companion, well the lower end one, being just the Cintiq 13HD with a tablet strapped on the back.

I also shop at Chinese supermarkets which are super cheap but have Chinese brands.Lastly, with other goods, because of Wal-Mart's massive buying power, the product SKUs are different because it's made specially for WalMart, so no price matching there either ☹ ",☹

t5_2s505,DocmanCC,1377042533,"Here ya go: http://i.imgur.com/FmobpFV.png ;)  We had a discussion about this over IRC.  Disabling **all** particles would be a Bad Thing™.  Particles include medusa bombs, poisons, traps, scepter and spell path trails, heal novas, etc.  There's a LOT of particle effects.  Simply disabling them all would be too much.  One thing they can remove, and has a proven performance benefit, is projectile impact effects.  It's those little sparks that fly off when you shoot a wall, etc.  Just turning those off has a noticeable effect in busy situations.    A similar idea is to remove ally projectiles.  Imho this removes a skill essential to bullet hell style games: dealing with the mess of bullets.  The advantage to the player is obvious, but is dumbing down the game again something we really want?  ",™

This is your point that I am refuting.   &gt;The Quran specifically states you follow ALL his books, and ALL his revelations, not just the Quran.  and this is what I have said in my previous comments.   &gt;Since Islam requires us to acknowledge/believe in previous scriptures but doesn't actually make us study or follow them.   Clearly what I have said is according to the Qur'an. What you are saying is that Not only should muslims belive in the previous scriptures. We should actually follow them as well. When I ask you for proof of this. You bring me a verse that I already agree with as I have shown in my above comments. Maybe its not clear to you. ** We are to believe in the previous scriptures, as an believe them to be real and original  word of God. Then Qur'an acknowledges the fact that these true scripture have been compromised because of the people have made changes to their books with their own hands.    &gt; I guess that means you have gone far astray right, since you deny the role of the Bible and Torah?   **So tell me again where I have not read my own scriptures and tell me how you have read the scriptures and understand them.

When entering the session, sit next to your husband.    2. When the narrator gives you the chance to withdraw, stand up and look around for a while. Then sit quietly back down.     3. When you are receiving the tokens, hold that handshake just a little too long while looking into the worker's eyes.    4. When posing in the Order of Prayer® (formerly the True Order of Prayer®), instead of repeating the choppy phrases of the officiator, recite the lyrics to your favorite song, or just say how you feel in that moment.  5. When at the veil, say Elohim's lines before he can. ""What is that? I asked you first.""  6. The first time Elohim asks you if you will give him the name of the 2nd token, say, ""Verily, I can. For I received it when last we conversed at the veil."" Then proceed to give the name.  6. Create your own name for the SToMP. Here's one suggestion: ""Pierced in the navel; bad to the bone; itchy in the groin from all the sins (ew); power to the people and my favorite tv series through all generations of time, with liberty and justice for all.""",®

t5_2qhps,scartol,1377090381,"HS English teacher here. I agree with the first part of this response, especially the part about reading more works that are commonly referenced. One of the most aggravating parts of the whole process is that you have to know what you're missing before you even realize you're missing things. Then you have to figure out *what* you're missing, and *then* figure out where to find it. And so on.  But I would strenuously urge you to avoid SparkNotes™ or any similar sites. It's easier to go to a website that simply tells you: ""Here's the allusion and here's what it means"", but it's very easy to become reliant on outside resources as a result. Much better to build your own skills, even if it takes longer and requires more effort. In the long run you will develop a sharper, more capable mind.  When I was a kid, our family went skiing from time to time. My father forbid me form using ski poles when I was learning. I thought they looked cool and would be helpful. He said: ""If you learn to ski with poles, and can't stop without them, and then you lose one on the slopes, what will you do?"" He was right. (He reminded me of this discussion when I wanted to use my calculator for math homework.)  Think also of Brad Pitt's character in the movie *Seven*. His flaws as an individual are beautifully demonstrated — without a word of dialogue — when a police officer discretely slips him a brown paper bag containing Cliffs Notes (which we used to read before the internet was available to everyone) on the books Morgan Freeman's character was studying in the library.",™

t5_2qh1i,hoilst,1377091173,"One of the great myths I've heard kicking around in the US about ""socialised healthcare"" is the death panel bullshit (we don't have those...but from all reports, private insurers in the Us do), and the idea that ""you can't pick your own doctor"".  I have a theory as to why the latter one was started: it's simply because universal healthcare is pretty hard to paint as a terrible imposition on Freedom™, so they had to make it look like it would be a massive imposition on your freedom of movement...which the Soviets weren't too keen on, either.",™

t5_2qh1f,IRELANDJNR,1377092324,"Knots 3D - such an abysmal dev effort and ripoff app of another far superior app called 'Animated Knots by Grog'.  Urban Dictionary - a shitty, shitty web view.  Jamn - marketed as revolutionarily simple, but in reality annoying complex, fiddly and I would say half decent looking but too frustrating to be considered useful.  NFL Kicker 13 - push notification spam!!! Applies to all Full Fat™ apps.  iCab web browser for OS X - it's like a virus that manages to infest your computer and proves seriously difficult to remove from your computer. AppZapper! or App Cleaner can't remove it. Do yourself a favour a never install that Mac app. As a matter of principle I've boycotted their iOS apps too.  iClock for Mac - same as iCab. Funnily enough the only 2 Mac apps I've encountered this in my 9 years of using Macs and both begin with the uninspired lowercase i. Let that be a lesson in an of itself.  Shazam - doesn't work for me. Ever. The only songs I would need to look up are ones I don't know the name of. And the app has turned into complete bloat ware with 500 features I don't understand.  Dictionary.com - because they've run out of financial ideas they forced themselves or decided that only way to make much is to take their users hostage. So rather than charging say a buck and letting users look up words, they've added 500 features nobody wants and they've even resorted to force hiding the keyboard when you open the app and tap the search bar in order to force those additional features that nobody wants down your throat. I find this move in particular unethical.  Words with Friends - Zynga  Emoji Art &amp; Text Picture (name continues for 10 other key targeted words) - the emoji part along with most words in that name are a lie. Since they launched the app they've continually stripped the app of the best text ascii pictures, added ad banners that never existed and added a pro version to further up-sell you. A clearly unethical company run by a total asshole.  The Night Sky - a bad rip off of Star Walk, despite The Night Sky's (and now version 2's) huge success. Star Walk is basically better in ever my way. And it's the original.  Reckless Racing 2 - they make an amazing version 1 and take ages spending loads of money only to release a clearly worse version 2 where gameplay is treated as a bullet point feature and not the whole point of a racing game's existence.  Photo Editor by Aviary - bad Instagram rip off with worse effects and no social network.  Instagram - after they sold to Facebook I have not used it and I got banned for I think breaking a rule though I was never warned not given an explanation.  WhatsApp - I refuse to use an app that ugly and badly designed.  imgurapp - an app I thought was Imgur's official app. It wasn't.  Imgur's official app - wasn't made in XCode and it shows. Probably an Adobe Air app of some sort. Shit code.  Poker by Zynga - Zynga  4oD - since they removed AirPlay",™

You are enjoying the male body of your lover. It's not invalidating. However, sometimes during foreplay when you get really grabby with your hands it does make me a little uncomfortable, but I'm willing to bet you never even noticed, because it was so miniscule and never brought on dysphoria. And the lack of dysphoria attached to that is both surprising and pleasing.  2) I think your happiness for me and seeing my own happiness will overpower the difficulty of the adjustment. Besides, you have difficult stuff to be helping out with in aftercare. You're not gonna have time for that difficulty because taking care of me after surgery is gonna be enough difficulty for you to handle.  3) I think doing it this way, where I just read this post, was a smart way of doing it.

They have a ""robo gut"" That they can culture more or less all organisms from one persons digestive system in. They took a bunch of volunteers, cultured their guts and then did a kind of battle royale (mixing half of one volunteers sample with half of another’s and seeing which community became dominant) to come up with the best mix for the treatment.  Also, next time you read the monoculture of a probiotic food, notice the little TM or R after the name of the organism. Most of the species have normal names, but for whatever reason the companies are allowed to trade mark a name onto whatever strain they happen to be using to make it sound healthier.

Additionally the GTA mandatory install is 8GB and would not fit on this particular flash drive since you don't get a full 8GB of storage.

The improvement over cheap fans is incredible  I'm surprised it is possible to hear one of those high efficiency fans when it is turned on.  Old cheapo fans cost $10 or $15, make way more noise, and use 4X as much electricity.  Looking at the spreadsheet shows even Panasonic makes a cheapo fan that has the efficiency of 2.8 cfm/w.   Copied from one of the high tech fan pages. ""This Panasonic WhisperGreen™ fan is designed to provide both bathroom exhaust and whole house ventilation. The high speed is fixed at 80 cfm for bathroom exhaust, with the low speed adjustable from 0 to 70 cfm, allowing you to establish the desired level of continuous exhaust for whole house ventilation. The high speed will be activated when someone enters the bathroom, and once the person has left return to low speed after a period of time has passed (user-adjustable to allow the high speed boost to run long enough to exhaust moisture after a shower).""

t5_2vdcr,binarypancakes,1377133650,"Another related quick and simple tip for the Frugal-minded folks:  Hang out by your local Coinstar machine and be quick to snatch up any loose change that may fall to the floor while the 1%'ers haphazardly dump their vats of unethically obtained wealth into the machine. If the situation gets heated, just cite the International Finders Keepers Law, article VI, section LVI from the Sixth Geneva Convention. Then, to assert your ethical and legal fortitude in the situation, threaten with a formal citizen's arrest after a publicly humiliating and legally grounded beatdown with your tubesock full of change which you have aptly named the ""Sacagawea Bruiser"" or if you are a minimalist like myself, simply ""The Redskin"". The pun will not be lost, and your dominance will most certainly be asserted. It is important to clearly state your sock's title and to ensure it references some aspect of Native American history or culture to guarantee that you are protected under the Injun Self-Defense and Assault Authorization Act of 2004.   Most reasonable persons will recognize that you have received top-dollar legal counsel and will not pursue further conflict. If, however, they fail to recognize your firm grasp on the tenets of public domain and Native American law, they will most likely act outside of the confines of what is legally admissible, potentially enabling you to win big in the courtroom. Unbeknownst to many, most judges and juries in America actually chose their careers because they suffer from incredible guilt and burden from the years of turmoil and abuses that their ancestors inflicted upon the native population. As a counteracting measure, a precedent has been set where they will typically rule in favor of the plaintiff who cites Native American Law along with claims of just reclamation of other's property. This is how I paid off my student loan debt from the University of Phoenix Law School and North American Mega-Barred^® Lawyers Association membership fees in less than 5 years.",®

I don't think that's true. You health care services, thanks to the Almighty Invisible Hand Of The Free Market™, are profiteered to hell and back. They are grossly over-inflated in order to line someone's pockets.   In Aus, I reckon that visit would not have cost you more than $50, adding on about another $30 for medicine. And if you were on a low income, that would be significantly less. That would be closer to the actual, REAL cost of the doctor's time and the medicine.   I heard a US backpacker down here talking about how he broke his arm in Sydney. He'd only saved up a couple of grand for the trip, had no travel insurance, and had to go to a hospital (naturally) to treat it.   His arm got X-Rayed, doctors looked at it, it was set, placed in a cast...then, because he was not an Aussie citizen, the hospital then had to present him with the bill: ""Unfortunately, we're going to have to charge you the full fee.""  The American only had about five grand of spending money for the trip, and started worrying about it being completely obliterated, having to go home early and pay off the debt, etc.  ""The total bill is $400.""   The American laughed. Paid the bill, thanked the doctors, and walked out. Couldn't believe how ""cheap"" it was.",™

The Second opening sounded like [Brokencyde] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8F5YSA1Oz0) to me and I don't like that. But the rest of soundtrack is good, a little bit of it actually reminds me of some of the Death Note ost.  It would be really hard to show you but around 1:34 of that first track it sounds almost exactly like the chorus of Surf Wax America by Weezer for like 8 seconds to me. When it started playing I started singing [""you take your car to work, I'll take my board, and when...""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=uk9SJva85Bs#t=27)  &gt; I'd have to say DMX after watching that video. Snoop is going need to bring something big to the table to make me change my mind.  Yeah Snoop may have invented kawaii, but DMX perfected.   &gt; It's just as beautiful as I imagined it would be. ;~;  I never knew that the Barkley game inspired most of these slam jam remixes, but I am so happy for it. It seriously goes with everything better than the Guile theme.  &gt; And if you think about it you'd travel to exotic places and meet lots of new people. It's perfect. :O  and everyone will be so jelly of my my new form.",™

t5_2qh63,LibertarianSoup,1377139739,"&gt;both would best be made by one person.  I completely disagree.   Typically, board of directors are chosen through a collective decision made by the shareholders. Would this decision be made best by only one of the shareholders, rather than the shareholders collectively?  &gt;In micro level problems like ""did that fast-ball cross the plate,"" the difference is negligible. In macro level problems the amplified time it took to take arguments and debate is much larger.  Comparing this amount of time, in the context of the entire game, with the ramifications (win probability added (WPA) for a statistical perspective of baseball events) of the vast majority of these difficult decisions, it is clear that this is the superior method, as in most cases, in my opinion.  &gt;that collective intellect doesn't translate well into action unless they agree on all points and push the same agenda  I think that theories of markets and prices would also contradict this, as both represent collective intellect and action through collective decisions, to which the intricacy and accuracy of these mechanism could never be ""designed"" by a single individual.  &gt;Why would it?  See above.  &gt;I don't want a collective to decide whether or not I need a new kidney.  I wouldn't want one single individual to decide whether or not I need a new kidney. In fact, I would argue that such a scenario would be much more problematic, which is why we typically see transplant lists organized and interpreted by ""boards"" of medical professionals.  &gt;As I explained about the encyclopedia example, the utility of the collective is information gathering, not collating or final production decision making.  And I think that Wikipedia proves this not to be true.  &gt;Right. But more than one review copy is still passed to a single copy editor for final submission.   The editor is simply organizing the opinions and review produced by these individuals, which collectively, are more desirable than the opinions and review produced by merely one of these individuals. Per the example of Wikipedia, I think that it is clear that even this would be, and can be, done more effectively through a collective decision making process.  &gt;and the only issues entrusted to a large group of individuals are the trivial ones that don't have a huge impact on the bottom line.  Why are shareholders entrusted to elect or choose the board of directors?   &gt;But, they're paid for a specific role in the company and that role is not likely to be dispassionate fact-based neutrality in decision making.  I thought you suggested that this was, in fact, their role... *""If you work for a company, your job is to help them earn as much or more money than they expend to employ you.""*  &gt;They probably go out of business. Hence why you see so little democratically organized companies that achieve great success.

t5_2rnve,Tall_bright_stranger,1377171683,"""Power supplies are the devices that power computer, servers and data center devices. They convert AC power from electric utilities into DC power used in most electronics. The 80 PLUS® performance specification requires power supplies in computers and servers to be 80% or greater energy efficient at 10, 20, 50 and 100% of rated load with a true power factor of 0.9 or greater. This makes an 80 PLUS certified power supply substantially more efficient than typical power supplies.""  Again, they test efficiency and voltage to be within the ATX spec at 10%, 20%, 50% and 100% of the rated power.  This means that if a unit cannot deliver its full rated power within ATX spec, it cannot get an 80+ certification. Why won't you trust me, when I say I know something about this?  http://www.plugloadsolutions.com/80pluspowersupplies.aspx  It's not merely the efficiency rating, because the efficiency depends largely on the loading of the PSU. Higher loads = lower efficiency. A typical curve looks like this:  http://media.www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Articles/Sources/C/Corsair%20TX650W/Images/tx650w_efficiency.jpg  ___  Why can we not trust Raidmax and Coolmax PSUs then?  80+ is tested at very low temperatures (under 30C). At realistic temperatures, the performance of a PSU is typically lower.  Raidmax and Coolmax use cheap components (cheap capacitors, for instance) that are more prone to failing than good PSUs.  RaidMax and Coolmax take the ATX spec to the limit - and 80+ does not test ripple and electrical noise in the output of the units. With high ripple, you'll wear down your other hardware faster - so this actually gets through the 80+ marking.  ___  You're learning a lot today.",®

Hell yeah dude we'll get along great, move on in! 4.  After a few days when they're settled, call the police and say that you're feeling unsafe because your new roomie threatened to kill himself. 5.  Cops come by and cuffs your new roomie and takes him away for a mandatory 72-hour hold. 6.  Party in his room, sell all his stuff on Craigslist, smoke all his weed. 7.  When he comes home from the hospital, call the police again and report him for trespassing since you didn't let him on the lease and all of his stuff have been sold.

t5_2qh6c,Hell0Sweetie,1377178706,"Praying for you. And my only advice to you during this time (which *will* pass eventually. That is just a matter of fact, not even faith.  Nothing stays the same, even when we wish it would. Things *will* feel better in time.), is to give yourself a break. You don't have to be the Perfect Christian™ in order to please God. Just be who you are, yell at Him if you need to, take a break from being strong for others in your life, or if you're serving in a church, realize that you can step back for a few days/weeks/months, and just do whatever is needed for you right now.   You might benefit from some counseling if you can- not someone you know, from a church you go to or whatever, but someone who doesn't know you. But mostly, just don't be so hard on yourself. Whatever pressure you're feeling about having enough faith or the right kind or whatever is *not* being put on you by God. Cut yourself some slack. You're not Superman or anything.    I am struggling with some intense depression myself right now (for the past year actually), so this is as much for me as it is for you so it's not just empty words. If that helps.   Praying. Pray for me also if you feel up to it. ",™

Das antike 16-strahlige Symbol fand sich bei Ausgrabungen im griechischen Teil der Region Makedonien. Daher beanspruchte Griechenland das Symbol für sich, ebenso wie es sich gegen den Landesnamen „Mazedonien“ wandte.   Die Schalker haben sie auch nicht 'gehoben', sie hing schon länger im Stadion:  &gt;Ausgangspunkt der Auseinandersetzung war eine mazedonische Fahne, die seit einiger Zeit aufgrund der Fanfreundschaft zum Club Vardar Skopje bei vielen Heimspielen im Schalker Block hängt.  Und was den 'Status Quo' betrifft, was genau wäre der im konkreten Fall: ""*Mazedonien existiert nicht""* - nur das griechische Makedonien©?  &gt;Der Einsatzleitung habe zudem die Information eines mitgereisten griechischen szenekundigen Polizisten vorgelegen, dass es sich beim Zeigen der Vergina-Sonne um den Tatbestand der Volksverhetzung handele. Auch der Polizist selbst habe sich demnach beleidigt gefühlt.  Daher kommt die 'Volksverhetzung' laut FAZ - ein griechischer Polizist fühlte sich beleidigt.  ",©

t5_2qh7a,vholecek,1377196955,"In my case, this person was my dad.  True to the cliche, I've been drawing ever since I could hold my own Crayolas™ without eating them.  My dad (as I would later learn through other means) was a young man who came to this country to become a rock star only to have that dream crushed and ended up going into medical technology and eventually becoming a business owner.  He would periodically parrot the platitude about how artists aren't worth anything until after they're dead.  And for a while, I gave in.  I put away my art supplies for 8 years while a string of dead-end jobs finally left me hungry enough to drive me into the military.  I did what I had to do.  As I was separating from the Air Force, I made a friend on myspace who, after some considerable conversational detouring, got to look at some of my old drawings.    She wanted me to start drawing again, which I had some reservations about and made all kinds of excuses to avoid, but in the end she mailed me a tin of colored pencils all the way from England on the condition that I had to promise to ""do something"" with them.  And so I did something...and then another something.  The course of the next year was an out-pouring of duty, determination, and defiance.  I pushed myself out of my old comfort zones, partly to prove it to myself, partly to experiment, and partly to spite everyone who said I was wasting my time.  My fuel became a volatile mixture of ambition, expression, and spite.  ...and. I. loved it...and while I'm by no means a success story, I have literally no idea what the point of this long, meandering, narrative actually was beyond fuck that teacher.",™

A court would inspect the situation and take into consideration several factors, one of which considers to which degree is the infraction egregious to a common observer. Trademark helps establish ownership and precedent and paves the way for this type of litigation.   For (a NSFW) example, the term GLAAD is a trademark. if the Westboro Baptist Church decides they're going to run a new campaign explaining that ""We're GLAAD™ those faggots are burnin' in hell."" This constitutes an egregious violation and would almost certainly lead to punitive measures.   Parody and the cherished notions of free speech against intellectual property are questioned with reckless abandon in upper courts, and rarely are they successfully defended.

t5_2tx47,bridget1989,1377200156,"I have 2 or 3 separate novels started, and about 5 short stories or novellas that may one day be novels, all with 20-something heroines starting their lives out after tragedy/hard times, or just making big life changes. I rarely veer from this genre. I write from experience.  I usually type, not write. I use Word when I'm at home and Google Docs when I'm away. I HAVE to clean my room first, and then I usually read through my old books and stories I have written. To get me in the mood.  I HATE planning a story beforehand. My writing strategy is usually to just dive in with the really juicy scenes (a fight between a current love interest, who is sort of helping to ""repair"" the heroine, and the abusive ex boyfriend, hell-bent on continuing to ruin his ex girlfriend's life even though she literally moved a few states away to remove herself from his bad influences), and then I go back and fill in the rest of the story bits that glue the big pieces together. THEN I might come up with some type of logical timeline of events and try to mold the whole thing together. I always write out of order.  During some of the really hard scenes to write, ones that hit me emotionally, I put on a few songs that fit the scene's mood on repeat.  My item:  [This book, Biting Anorexia, is $0.11 cents plus shipping, used](http://www.amazon.com/Biting-Anorexia-Firsthand-Account-Internal/dp/1572247029/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=2Z8QXC2F6RJMY&amp;coliid=I16N7DAR3WITQ8). I have struggled, and still sometimes struggle, with Anorexia. A lot of my book characters struggle, too. I like to read all the other fiction about Anorexia to get a feel for how other authors deal with it realistically, while relating the pain, control, and confusion of the disorder to readers that have and have not struggled with it.

t5_2qh1i,guna_clan,1377225580,"This was written by MIT professor for his class of 2010. I can't provide the actual source cause I'm on my phone. I know it's a wall of text but definitely worth the read.   50 Things   Dear Class of 2010,  This will be my last entry written specifically for you; beginning with the launch of our new site in early September, I'll begin focusing on the future class of 2011. I hope that you guys won't be strangers; stay in touch either in person (come visit us!) or online (please drop by the blogs from time to time and say hi).  As you begin your college experience, and I prepare for my 10-year college reunion, I thought I'd leave you with the things that, in retrospect, I think are important as you navigate the next four years. I hope that some of them are helpful.  Here goes...  * ▪Your friends will change a lot over the next four years. Let them. * ▪Call someone you love back home a few times a week, even if just for a few minutes. * ▪In college more than ever before, songs will attach themselves to memories. Every month or two, make a mix cd, mp3 folder, whatever - just make sure you keep copies of these songs. Ten years out, they'll be as effective as a journal in taking you back to your favorite moments. * ▪Take naps in the middle of the afternoon with reckless abandon. * ▪Adjust your schedule around when you are most productive and creative. If you're nocturnal and do your best work late at night, embrace that. It may be the only time in your life when you can. * ▪If you write your best papers the night before they are due, don't let people tell you that you ""should be more organized"" or that you ""should plan better."" Different things work for different people. Personally, I worked best under pressure - so I always procrastinated... and always kicked ass (which annoyed my friends to no end). ;-) Use the freedom that comes with not having grades first semester to experiment and see what works best for you. * ▪At least a few times in your college career, do something fun and irresponsible when you should be studying. The night before my freshman year psych final, my roommate somehow scored front row seats to the Indigo Girls at a venue 2 hours away. I didn't do so well on the final, but I haven't thought about psych since 1993. I've thought about the experience of going to that show (with the guy who is now my son's godfather) at least once a month ever since. * ▪Become friends with your favorite professors. Recognize that they can learn from you too - in fact, that's part of the reason they chose to be professors. * ▪Carve out an hour every single day to be alone. (Sleeping doesn't count.) * ▪Go on dates. Don't feel like every date has to turn into a relationship. * ▪Don't date someone your roommate has been in a relationship with. * ▪When your friends' parents visit, include them. You'll get free food, etc., and you'll help them to feel like they're cool, hangin' with the hip college kids. * ▪In the first month of college, send a hand-written letter to someone who made college possible for you and describe your adventures thus far. It will mean a lot to him/her now, and it will mean a lot to you in ten years when he/she shows it to you. * ▪Embrace the differences between you and your classmates. Always be asking yourself, ""what can I learn from this person?"" More of your education will come from this than from any classroom. * ▪All-nighters are entirely overrated. * ▪For those of you who have come to college in a long-distance relationship with someone from high school: despite what many will tell you, it can work. The key is to not let your relationship interfere with your college experience. If you don't want to date anyone else, that's totally fine! What's not fine, however, is missing out on a lot of defining experiences because you're on the phone with your boyfriend/girlfriend for three hours every day. * ▪Working things out between friends is best done in person, not over email. (IM does not count as ""in person."") Often someone's facial expressions will tell you more than his/her words. * ▪Take risks. * ▪Don't be afraid of (or excited by) the co-ed bathrooms. The thrill is over in about 2 seconds. * ▪Wednesday is the middle of the week; therefore on wednesday night the week is more than half over. You should celebrate accordingly. (It makes thursday and friday a lot more fun.) * ▪Welcome failure into your lives. It's how we grow. What matters is not that you failed, but that you recovered. * ▪Take some classes that have nothing to do with your major(s), purely for the fun of it. * ▪It's important to think about the future, but it's more important to be present in the now. You won't get the most out of college if you think of it as a stepping stone. * ▪When you're living on a college campus with 400 things going on every second of every day, watching TV is pretty much a waste of your time and a waste of your parents' money. If you're going to watch, watch with friends so at least you can call it a ""valuable social experience."" * ▪Don't be afraid to fall in love. When it happens, don't take it for granted. Celebrate it, but don't let it define your college experience. * ▪Much of the time you once had for pleasure reading is going to disappear. Keep a list of the books you would have read had you had the time, so that you can start reading them when you graduate. * ▪Things that seem like the end of the world really do become funny with a little time and distance. Knowing this, forget the embarrassment and skip to the good part. * ▪Every once in awhile, there will come an especially powerful moment when you can actually feel that an experience has changed who you are. Embrace these, even if they are painful. * ▪No matter what your political or religious beliefs, be open-minded. You're going to be challenged over the next four years in ways you can't imagine, across all fronts. You can't learn if you're closed off. * ▪If you need to get a job, find something that you actually enjoy. Just because it's work doesn't mean it has to suck. * ▪Don't always lead. It's good to follow sometimes. * ▪Take a lot of pictures. One of my major regrets in life is that I didn't take more pictures in college. My excuse was the cost of film and processing. Digital cameras are cheap and you have plenty of hard drive space, so you have no excuse. * ▪Your health and safety are more important than anything. * ▪Ask for help. Often. * ▪Half of you will be in the bottom half of your class at any given moment. Way more than half of you will be in the bottom half of your class at some point in the next four years. Get used to it. * ▪In ten years very few of you will look as good as you do right now, so secretly revel in how hot you are before it's too late. * ▪In the long run, where you go to college doesn't matter as much as what you do with the opportunities you're given there. The MIT name on your resume won't mean much if that's the only thing on your resume. ▪As a student here, you will have access to a variety of unique opportunities that no one else will ever have - don't waste them. * On the flip side, don't try to do everything. Balance = well-being. * ▪Make perspective a priority. If you're too close to something to have good perspective, rely on your friends to help you. * ▪Eat badly sometimes. It's the last time in your life when you can do this without feeling guilty about it. * ▪Make a complete ass of yourself at least once, preferably more. It builds character. * ▪Wash your sheets more than once a year. Trust me on this one. * ▪If you are in a relationship and none of your friends want to hang out with you and your significant other, pay attention. They usually know better than you do. * ▪Don't be afraid of the weird pizza topping combinations that your new friend from across the country loves. Some of the truly awful ones actually taste pretty good. Expand your horizons. * ▪Explore the campus thoroughly. ▪Don't get caught. * ▪Life is too short to stick with a course of study that you're no longer excited about. Switch, even if it complicates things. * ▪Tattoos are permanent. Be very certain. * ▪Don't make fun of prefrosh. That was you like 2 hours ago. * ▪Enjoy every second of the next four years. It is impossible to describe how quickly they pass. * This is the only time in your lives when your only real responsibility is to learn. Try to remember how lucky you are every day.    Be yourself. Create. Inspire, and be inspired. Grow. Laugh. Learn. Love.  Welcome to some of the best years of your lives.  -B",▪

t5_2qh4s,nicekid81,1377226524,"Oh, ho;  That opens up a lot of possibilities; if you're okay with considering other month-to-month carriers, I'll give you a breakdown;  * [Straight Talk](http://www.straighttalk.com/wps/portal/home/!ut/p/b1/04_SjzQ0MzIzNjAwMzXVj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOJdDLx8jQMdPYyCPMxNDTwDPJyD3c39DPzdjPTD9aPASgxwAEcDfT-P_NxU_dwoLwsAPBqpXQ!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) and [Simple Mobile](http://www.simplemobile.com/wps/portal/home/!ut/p/b1/04_Sj9Q1MjAzszQ3tzS30I_Qj8pLLMtMTyzJzM9LzAHxo8ziXQy8fI0DHT2MgjzMTQ08Azycg93N_Qz83Yz0w_WjwEoMcABHA30_j_zcVP3cKC8LAFoXxVQ!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) both offer a no-contract unlimited everything service for $40~$45/mo., and they are T-Mobile compatible - which means, **you can buy any T-Mobile Phone and plug in the SIM card . . . and you're set!**  I'm personally using Simple Mobile's service on my [Lumia 521](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-521-T-Mobile/dp/B00COYOAYW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377223821&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lumia+521), still locked to T-Mobile, it works just fine. * [MetroPCS](http://www.metropcs.com/metro/) also offers the same $40/mo unlimited no-contract plans, and they also use the T-Mobile bandwidth. * [Page Plus](https://www.pagepluscellular.com/) offers a  $30/mo no contract option as mentioned in my previous post, and they're compatible with almost any Verizon phones in the market.  CDMA phones are a bit more tricky than simply plopping in a SIM card - you have to re-register the phone through their website but it's a fairly straightforward process.  If you do decide on Page Plus, I'd recommend [Kitty Wireless](http://www.kittywireless.com/) - a reseller, but at the same rates and their customer service is better. * [Boostmobile](http://www.boostmobile.com/shop/plans/monthly-unlimited/) does have some compatibility with Sprint phones, [but there are limitations](http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=sprint+phones+on+boostmobile&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest), and the process seems a bit more complicated than going Verizon&gt;Page Plus.  I was looking at doing so with a [HTC Evo 4G LTE(Sprint)](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_evo_4g_lte-4665.php) that I was able to get for $170 from Ebay, but the process was too much of a headache so I gave up and ended up selling it on Ebay.  What does this mean?  Well, you have more options for phones if you're flexible with other carriers - based on your options I'm going to assume you're looking for a smartphone in the $200~240 max range.  **If you're looking for new**  * It does look like you're skewed towards Android phones, but I have to recommend the [Lumia 521/520(T-Mobile)](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-521-T-Mobile/dp/B00COYOAYW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377223821&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lumia+521)  ([specs](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_520-5322.php)) - you're simply not going to be able to get the same level of finish or functionality for this price for a new Android phone.  It's a great little phone for what it does. * It is a bit over your budget, but you cannot go wrong with the [Nexus 4(unlocked - works as long as you plop in a working SIM card)](http://www.google.com/nexus/4/)([Specs](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_4_e960-5048.php)) - its specs blow anything else out of the water for its price, a great phone. * It is locked to MetroPCS (again, it uses the same frequencies as T-Mobile - just like Simple Mobile - so you shouldn't have connection issues if your friend doesn't), the [LG Optimus L9](http://www.metropcs.com/metro/detail/LG_Optimus_L9™/610214632647#.UhbKR0Ct--I) has comparable [specs](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_optimus_l9_p769-5025.php) to the phones you were looking at - in fact, it has a slightly better display resolution - and it's $120, considerably cheaper than the Boostmobile options you're considering.  **If you're okay with used**  * Ooh boy, the world is your oyster - look in Ebay or Craigslist for used phones in your range, and you won't have a shortage of great phones in your price range - [The One X(AT&amp;T - you may have to unlock this one)](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_one_x-4320.php), [The Droid Razr M(Verizon)](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_droid_razr_m-4973.php), [The Galaxy SIII(T-Mobile or Verizon)](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Cell-Phones-Smartphones-/9355/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=Samsung+Galaxy+3&amp;_dcat=9355&amp;Model=Samsung%2520Galaxy%2520S%2520III&amp;rt=nc) - they're all flagship phones from a year ago (not so sure about the Razr M), offer superior specs to the phones mentioned above and frankly, you won't be able to really tell a performance difference between this year's flagship and these phones outside of a benchmark. Assuming you're okay with used, you can find a mint condition phone at around the price range you were originally looking at.  Of course, you will need to do some digging to find a good condition phone in your price range (haggling works in scenarios like this) make sure you do your homework before pulling the trigger, but I've had pretty good luck buying from users with high ratings or meeting up in person to check it out before buying. * You can get even a better deal if you are okay with non-flagship phones, like the [HTC First(AT&amp;T - you may have to unlock)](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_first-5395.php) a perfectly capable phone marred by non-marketing by HTC - but because of that, you can find fantastic deals on those phones just because they're not that popular.  Looking them up on Craigslist around my area, I'm finding them listed for $180 OBO fairly often.  But that does take a bit more work, and it's not for everyone.  Good luck finding a phone and I hope you're happy with whatever you decide!",™

Don't get surgery, you are still so young and so much will change over the next 5-10 years. You have a beautiful face and those cheeks that you feel so self conscious about will be your saving grace as you age.   I know I'm just an internet stranger, but believe me they will keep you young. If you're still contemplating it after all the wonderful compliments in this thread, pm me and I will send you pictures of myself at 18 and now. I had the same issues with my appearance, but as I reached around 22 I lost the last of my baby fat. Yes, I said baby fat. Thats all it is hunny and sometimes, I wish I could have it back.   Its strange but you can hate so much of your appearance in the present and then look back at pictures a few years down the road, and wish you could look that way again.

t5_mouw,allcoloursit,1377234693,"I consider this article to be dangerously misleading, as I presume the message comes from those who are seeking the good and are innocently blind enough to the bad.  For a contrasting perspective then, I offer a concise summary of my experience.    From one use of mushrooms, combined with marijuana, I endured an experience which transformed my sense of self, others, the nature of reality, and all things, to such an extent that I believe I died.  I felt spiritually enlightened in certain ways, but quickly fell from that grace into chaotic fear and confusion that consumed and overwhelmed me, accompanied by a visceral reaction of partial physical and non-physical death.    My experience with mushrooms and cannabis severed me from my former self and left me in a personal Hell which persisted with intensity for a year of my life.  For the majority of my time then, I physically isolated myself from everyone I knew and obsessively focused on reconciling deep inner conflict.  What was once a happy life, filled with love and friendship, became a prison of disturbed solitude where I walked the edge of insanity.    Throughout that year and continuing on past a second year now, I have continually contemplated and meditated with enough introspection and passionate soul searching that I have gradually, over emotional ups and downs, redeveloped or acquired enough good thought patterns and behaviors in the consistency of my character, that I feel mostly well, most of the time.  Which means for the most part, it seems I have dug myself out of the dark hole I was in.  But it has massively warped who I am, made my future very uncertain, and it is not clear to me whether it will end up being for better or worse.    I have known many people who've done drugs and a good number of people who've done mushrooms.  My perception is that it has significantly changed all of them, especially the ones who've taken shrooms.  Perhaps it has changed them in some ways for the better, but certainly in other ways for the worse.  From all my time spent obsessively discerning the effects of drugs on my self and others, I currently conclude that they almost always bring out some kinds of negative effects in people, whether subtle or severe, and more often than not, the person affected is largely unaware of what catalyzed their problems.  It doesn't surprise me then to hear many drug users focus on the good they find in it, while being oblivious to the bad.    The moral of the story is that I advise great caution in dealing with drugs, and while I acknowledge you will likely find some reward in their use, I offer a serious warning that you may be giving up more than you bargained for.  I personally wouldn't recommend psychedelics unless you are willing to die for what you are in pursuit of and you aren't willing to find a better way to achieve your goals without drugs.  I'd say recognize your own power in your potential for free will, and choose wisely.    ~☮~ ",☮

This will bring SimCity to focus (I hope all the language clients are similar and start with SimCity™ as the window title).  The program sends the ""n"" or ""m"" key every 1 second to SimCity. There are Three Hotkeys for your convenience to alleviate alt tabbing.    - F1 - Stops the program from sending ""n"" or ""m""    - F2 - Resumes the program so it starts sending ""n"" or ""m""   - F3 - This will CHECK or UNCHECK the ""Path Raise"" box for you!

t5_2rcsz,mfinn,1377260215,"Don't refill with plan water...if you get any suck back it's going to pull in dirty water.  This is your most likely vector of infection.  Always use Star San or something like cheap vodka in your airlocks, even when refilling.  Take the advice from others about PBW as well.  Bleach will only sanitize the surfaces of whatever it touches.  If you have grime of any kind, it won't remove that, nor neccessarily sanitize it.  Scrub with soap, rinse 3 or 4 times, then soak overnight in PBW or Oxyclean Free...these two items will oxidize the crap that might be in your fermenter or equipment...then scrub and rinse again....THEN soak in a bleach solution.  One other important item to remember when using bleach, it breaks down really fast.  I think it's something like only 50% effective at 3-5 months old, so you'd need to use twice as much to sanitize, and it gets rapidly worse from there.    &gt;Bleach is one of those household chemicals that loses its activity over time. It doesn't matter whether or not the bleach container has been opened or not. Temperature is the primary factor affecting how long bleach remains active.  &gt;According to Clorox™, the amount of hypochlorite that is added to their bleach depends on the season in which it is manufactured, because temperature affects the decomposition rate of sodium hypochlorite. So, more hypochlorite is added to bleach made in the summer than in cooler months. Clorox aims to maintain a 6% hypochlorite concentration for at least six months after the manufacturing date, assuming the bleach is stored around 70°F. It takes about 4-8 weeks from the time chlorine bleach is made to when it gets to a store so that you can buy it to take home. This leaves you 3-5 months where the bleach is at the effectiveness level stated on its label.  &gt;Does this mean bleach is useless after 3-5 months? No, because you probably don't need 6% hypochlorite for laundry and home disinfection. The 6% hypochlorite level is an EPA disinfection standard. If you store your bleach where it can get warmer than 70°F... like 90°F... the bleach is still effective for around three months.  &gt;So, when you buy a bottle of bleach, it has a shelf life. The bleach will be highly effective for around 6 months and fine for home use for around 9 months. If you're like me and have had the same bottle for a couple of years, it's probably time to go shopping.  If you are using a plastic fermenter or equipment that has scratches in it, it may be impossible to remove all of the bacteria/wild yeasts that might inhabit it unfortunately.  In that case, toss it and get a new one.  Don't use any scrubbing utensils that are not rated as ""safe"" for non stick (those green 3m scrub pads will ruin a plastic fermenter in one go , since they are so abrasive).  ",™

t5_2qh3s,nankerjphelge,1377262338,"I think the big difference between the Ledger casting and the Affleck casting is their stature going into those respective castings.  When he was cast as the Joker, Ledger had had a few movies under his belt, and people knew who he was, but he was known more for smaller films and more artistic choices, not big time Hollywood blockbusters.  He hadn't yet cemented a long standing public image or archetype as an actor.  Same with Christian Bale.  Whereas Ben Affleck has long been a worldwide big time Movie Star™, who's starred in blockbusters (both successful and failed) and there is a definite archetype that he now embodies as an actor in the minds of most of the public.  Because of that, for me it's going to be tough to see him simply as Batman, and not Ben Affleck, Movie Star™ As Batman.  The only way I can see it happening is if he pulls off the acting performance of a lifetime, the kind he hasn't yet shown in any of his prior acting jobs.",™

t5_2r8ot,Veedrac,1377264923,"&gt;First, sorting is cheap in Python. It's highly optimized, and almost certainly not the bottleneck in anything you're doing.  I do agree in this case (and I think I mentioned as such 😁). As they say, if Tim can't sort it, no-one can.  However, there are cases where a [heap queue](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/heapq.html) instead of a sort, or a dictionary instead of a sorted list, will make a blazingly big difference.  &gt;Second, my filesystem stores filenames in directories in order. Python's sort detects this ordering and makes sorting a fast O(n) operation.  Mine doesn't... :(  ---  I hadn't considered the time for IO, but in retrospect it's an obvious conclusion.",😁

India is a country of 1.24 billion people.  And you believe because you see a handful of biased articles about violent crime against women citing an insignificantly small number of incidents of violence that there's an ""epidemic""(buzzwords, for people with weak arguments and strong emotions).

Many of them couldn't care less about Google's bottom line, they just want to make cool products and features.  Here's an example. You know how Youtube's top search bar [is always white](http://i.imgur.com/YO38Qoz.png)? Well, go there and search for ""Fluttershy"", the name of a yellow cartoon pony. Hey look, [the bar turned bright yellow](http://imgur.com/YO38Qoz,mtRESv9,oiXy6Td#2), matching the color of that pony's fur. Likewise, search ""Pinkie Pie"", the name of a pink colored pony, and [the entire top bar turns pink](http://i.imgur.com/mtRESv9.png).  Well, even if you (rightfully so) hate that pony cartoon, you gotta admit that's a pretty spiffy little feature they put it. Now, what do you think is more likely here:  **1)** Google did market research, determined changing the color of the search bar to match the colors of My Little Pony**™** would increase their revenue and market share. Held a meeting with HASBRO INC. Discussed usage rights to their product names. Worked out a deal in which Google includes code in their search bar, allowing them to recognize and show special results for trademarked Hasbro properties...  or  **2)** Someone at Google likes ponies. They thought it would be fun if the bar changed color. Tee hee.  Long story short, not everything a company does (yes, even large multinationals) is for the bottom line.

t5_2qpkc,Kichigai,1377290314,"&gt; I know in a perfect work picture lock means no more changes but in my experience there is always a mistake found or just something over time we decide we want to change.  Depending on the nature of the change, often audio doesn't need to be altered. However, there *has* to be a time where you say ""OK, that's it. We can't make any more changes if we want to make our deadlines."" There have been several times where we've looked at something and we've really been bumping up against something, and had to make the call that it's too late to change it, and deal with what we have as Good Enough™.  &gt; This project has a deadline of Aug 29th for a premiere and not everything that needs to be done will be done in time. The edit is essentially picture locked and has been for some time but have a few scenes that don't have final music and VFXs.  If you're just adding VFX and music, that can be handled without needing to round-trip. You can add the music in edit, if need be, and just replace the reference picture when you have the final VFX.  &gt; I anticipate that once those are complete we'll find compelling reasons to adjust the edit on those scenes.  My advice here is *don't* round-trip, period. When the final VFX comes back, put it into your picture, rough in your audio changes, then send those segments over to sound.  &gt; I realize a round trip is probably not possible in our workflow so a I've decided to create a session for each scene instead of mixing the entire film in one session. This way if there are changes only a single scene's worth of audio work will be ""lost"" and have to be reapplied.  That's a pretty good way to go, but we've had to make some changes after picture lock before, and we have a trick for this. I'm not *too* familiar with how Audition handles OMFs, but in Pro Tools it just takes the OMF, reads the timecodes, and drops stuff in on top of whatever is there. So what we do, is that when the audio has changed, we duplicate our sequence, and delete *everything except* the content that has changed. So that the *only* stuff in this new sequence is the changed bits of audio, and kick that out to an OMF. Then when it's brought into Pro Tools it just drops in the changed bits of audio without having to redo the entire thing.  Long story short: you can still make some changes without having to round trip. Trust me, round tripping is way more effort than it's worth, because then you have potential compatibility issues, plug-ins that don't cross over with your audio, effects that can't translate, and a whole host of other problems that might come up. As long as you consider your timing as fixed, and you have hard outs at certain points, you can just export the stuff that changes without having to redo the whole deal, and avoid having to pass everything back and forth.  Given that you have less than a week to make this all happen, though, there will definitely be a time where you're going to have to say, ""no more changes"" and just make things work.",™

The first article deals only with health and I do have to point out that neutering seems to INCREASE the risk of prostate cancer, (as well as other things) not reduce it. The second article deals with health too but also societal and behavioural concerns. One link is to a radio show talk and one link is a rebuttal of the one above it.

As for actually being In Love™? It's worth reminding yourself that some of this is viewed through hindsight: you already know how things turned out in this particular case, so it's easy to dismiss the relationship post hoc as having arisen from a *necessarily* flawed foundation.  Perhaps this is separate from the point you were trying to make, but I think all relationships, whether the feelings are objectively ""justified"" or not (whatever the hell objectivity would entail in this context), begin with some idealization, occasionally lapsing into actual willful blindness. So I'd be wary of suggesting that limerence or infatuation or outright *lust* somehow render illegitimate one's romantic ardor. After all, aren't these ingredients at the beginning of most successful relationships, too?  Long-term? It's one of those things that'll have to stand the test of time. Going forward? I suppose the trick is hoping that you'll have learned enough from your past experiences to have developed a better sense for (1) what's *important* to you in a relationship and (2) how to identify whether you'll get what you're seeking *from the person to whom you're attracted.* It's a pity that it seems to be human nature that most of us have to fumble blindly before getting a little self-insight into these questions—and moreover, that said fumbling often results in a lot of heartache.",™

What seems to happen is whenever you update your surface, the graphics card reverts/updates to a different update that it seems to be taking forever for the bluestacks peeps to support. To fix it, download the ""Surface Pro Intel® HD graphics Driver Download"" in the sidebar. This should totally fix bluestacks, until you update again, which will likely revert the graphics card. When this happens, you will need to download that driver again. Beyond that, it's worked pretty well for me, but now that Windows 8 is getting more and more support, I'm finding myself using bluestacks far less, though that's just a personal thing.

t5_2tx47,bridget1989,1377300339,"I am a high school teacher, and I've never worked with children with Autism before, but I know that kids with Autism really like routines. Your best bet is to make a bew, fun, manageable routine for your student.  Another thing I would recommend is to try to make this student a special part of any activities you have that he is capable of. For example, if you are playing a math game, let him take score, or have him point to whose turn it is. If you are taking a water fountain break. let him be the line leader and hold a special sign that says ""Mr. TIGRlily's Water Break."" Give him manageable tasks, and always let him be in charge of them. I don't know how delayed he is, but special jobs can make students with disabilities gain confidence and help them grow and learn.  Make sure to vary the structure within each lesson. If you are adding, have them add on the chalk board, then have them all add on their fingers together, then pass out calculators so everyone can add on there, then give them beads or M&amp;Ms or some other object to count. This is good for all kids, obviously, but it also helps delayed students better understand things because they're delivered in multiple ways, a few of which they might understand and a few of which they might not.  Be patieint. Never see you get upset with him. Try to avoid typical punishments like delayed recess time and lean more toward diverting bad behavior into a good behavior. Constantly reward him with hugs and tough if he is going good.  Good luck, and you're doing great work! I'm proud of you! ♥",♥

There was a guy at work a little older than me who was the manager of another department.  I thought he was very handsome, and he was always really nice to me.  The girls at work had been telling me for months that he had a crush on me.  We both regularly worked in the evening (I managed a team in the evening, he often stayed late to finish projects), so I decided to put on my Big Girl Panties^® and ask him out to dinner.  I gathered all my courage, dialed his extension, and asked him if he wanted to go grab a bite to eat since we were both working late.  **HE SAID NO.**  Deflated, I hurriedly said bye and hung up.  I wasn't dying of embarrassment or anything, but I was taken aback because I was so sure he would say yes.  Things were a little awkward between us after that.  A month later, we chatted in the break room and he invited me to go flying with him on the weekend because he had just gotten his pilot's license.  I said no because I already had plans with someone else (who ended up becoming my husband).",®

t5_2tx47,HeadlessBob17,1377314870,"Okay, I am going to go all film student on this one because I spent an awful amount of time on it for a senior thesis, so bear with me:  One film that moves me each time I view it is *After Life* (Hirokazu Kore-eda, 1998). The plot concerns a group of counselors who guide the recently deceased into the afterlife through helping them recreate one memory on film to keep throughout eternity. The film was originally intended to be an hour-long documentary on what memories people from a cross-section of Japanese society would take with them into the afterlife, but Kore-eda was so fascinated by his footage, he decided that he would create a feature-length film with an added fictional storyline. The film focuses on the way in which emotions tend to color the way people choose to remember events – their stories blend “objective reality” and “emotional recollection”. Challenging common notions that memory merely consists of what happened in a person’s past, Kore-eda constructed a film that would use these interviews and a fictional premise to allow the viewers to redefine their ideas of the nature of memory and no longer see memories as accurate representations of the past.   In non-film student terms: all memories are tainted by our emotions – for example, in reality meeting your husband/wife might have been an objectively ordinary encounter at the time, but looking back knowing that this person became the love of your life, you might stress the way you could feel a connection immediately or how time seemed to stand still (even though time in fact was moving at its normal pace).   I love this film because it positions the viewer to actively internalize the argument on memory and contemplate its meaning within his or her own life. The film not only challenged my perceptions on memory, it prompted me to ask myself, “If I could keep only one memory of my life throughout eternity, what would it be?” Weeks after watching the film, a viewer can still be searching for the one memory worth taking into eternity, and, if one believes Kore-eda’s viewpoint that “Our memories are not fixed or static. They are dynamic, reflecting selves that are constantly changing,” audiences will never reach a concrete answer and continue to remember Afterlife’s questions for their entire lives.  I wrote an entire final paper on this film for one of my film school classes, forcing me to watch the movie dozens of time. I still choke up when I see the various characters getting to re-create the happiest moments of their lives. I really couldn’t recommend this film enough – go out and see it! To this day I still haven’t decided on what moment I would want filmed for me – I have so many happy memories and more keep adding on. This film provides a wonderful excuse to remember all the things I should be/am happy for in my life. ☺   (*Edited for gramatical error. Also, if I win feel free to chose any item from my wish list. I love surprises).",☺

In theory, should be great at determining things like stage presence, group dynamics, and musical ability if applicable.  Howard: Host and Interviewer personality.

Although she does have a personal musical ability, she doesn't really have a background that would make her a judge of anything more than appearance (maybe props and overall image too). However, as most people know, talent  can take on all sorts of shapes, sizes, etc. Susan Boyle is a good example of this. So, can Heidi judge talent more than any other celebrity or whoever?

t5_2w8vd,lurking_quietly,1377333375,"I think all healthy men have a healthy libido. (And, I suppose, [tautologies are tautological.](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_%28logic%29)) But wanting *only* one thing certainly evinces a limited view of, well..., *life*.  Your alcohol-marinated heartache notwithstanding, I encourage you not to give up. Not because there's some magic spell you might cast that would resolve this for you, nor because things will *inevitably* improve. That would be dishonest. It *is*, however, true that your self-awareness of this is incredibly important to solving your problem.  So you've always—*thus far*, an worthwhile caveat to include in your internal monologue—ended up with the wrong kind of man? Here are a few ideas worth pondering while you vent a little (and perhaps drink more than a little):  1. What might you be able to do to start attracting the right kind of guy? Or, perhaps equivalently, what can you do to maximize the likelihood that men will understand to treat you as you deserve? One broad example: if you don't set personal boundaries, then men will likely start to treat you as a doormat.  2. Conversely, are there possible Nice Guys™ out there who, for whatever reason, just aren't showing up on your radar? Maybe they're not assertive enough, and that's a turn-off. Maybe you can't tell when one's attracted to you. Maybe they're practically invisible to you for whatever reason. Or maybe you're convinced no actual Nice Guys™ even exist. If so, perhaps you're right, but it's worth it for you to be sure you're right about this.  3. Are any of these patterns that you would easily recognize happening to someone else—like a sister or best friend—but you just have some blind spot when this happens to yourself? If you can recognize relationship red flags in others, then it's a matter of sorting out how you can develop the same sense of recognition in your own life. Some simple thought experiments you might imagine: if you find yourself in a bad situation, imagine the advice you'd give to someone *else* in the same situation. Then follow that advice. Alternatively, imagine looking at your situation through the eyes of, say, a hypothetical daughter. What example would you want to provide for her?  4. Need a fresh set of objective eyes? An opportunity to vent? Well, consider lurking in or posting to [one or more of the subreddits in this multireddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen+AskWomen+Divorce+relationships+relationshipadvice+Relationship_Advice+sex+offmychest ""It looks like /r/relationshipadvice is being redirected to /r/relationship_advice, but I'm including both out of thoroughness."") Alternatively, give yourself a mental health break somewhere fun or light like /r/aww—or, of course, somewhere off reddit or even *offline entirely*. (I know, what a thought, huh?)  5. And oh yeah, there's always your resources in [meatspace!](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace ""SFW link, I swear!"") There's friends, family, and other people whom you could talk to face-to-face about this. Maybe to vent, maybe to get advice.  Yeah, this sucks for you right now. During the process of sucking, you're not going to feel like picking at those emotional scabs, so don't think you need to do any or all of this all at once or right away.  Most important, it's *not* your fault when someone else treats you badly. It is, however, *your* heart, so you have more interest in protecting it than anyone. Take care, and best wishes!",™

t5_2ro0h,u83rmensch,1377341584,"Let me pull out a list of my favorites. Avatar being one of my all time favorite series, let me pull out a list for you a set of shows and series that have always been up there (perhaps with a bit of commentary)   * Avatar the Last air bender   * The Legend of Korra (not as well written as the first but 3x prettier)  * Wakfu   (probably right next to avatar TLAB as a favorite. Smooth, clean, clear, vibrant, and color art/animation make this some fantastic eye candy, also has one of the best villains of all time )   * Dragon ball (and dragon ball z). personally liked the original series better, I bring this up only because I KNOW every one has seen Dragon ball z, but it seems less have seen the original dragon ball series. The original series had a much different storyboard/writing layout than that of the dbz series,  highly recommend this if you've not seen it.  * young justice (sadly cancelled because I have no idea why, super well made show DC animated series)  * justice league and justice league unlimited. (unlimited is the game it adopted in season 2, not sure why. The series does not exactly follow a full story from start to finish much like comic books do, however the three part episodes and special appearance episodes are the ones that make this really great, especially for comic book fans)   * teen titans. (again this does not have a full from start to finish story line, but does have its story archs such as robins battles with slade and cyborgs adventures with H.I.V.E. and brother blood.)   * Panty and Stocking (the most vulgar shows I've seen since south park and wonder shozen, granted nothing beats wonder shozen on the ""WTF"" scale, this show is great fun if you want something silly and entertaining)   * Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi ( I tend to not care for anime too much but this series was great, it was not too long so it didnt over stay its welcome and kept me laughing almost the whole way through. Every episode seems to just make fun of its self being an anime as it spoofs and goofs on every genre of anime as it goes, plus art and animation are top notch.)   * The Treasures of Kerub (This one is another show by the makers of Wakfu. Its set in the same universe but years before Wakfu. I dont enjoy quite as much as I ~~liked~~ loved wakfu, but it is still a silly and enjoyable series)   * The Venture Bros (another show I cant fully explain to tell you how awesome it is. basically just watch this show, its fucking great)   * Tron Uprising (this one im a little reluctant to recommend only because it feel unfinished. they tried to wrap it up real quick in the last episode they knew they'd are as it got canned by Disney due to low rating. over all though I did highly enjoy it)   * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2012+ (I havent kept up with this show as of lately, but I did watch maybe the first 8 or 9 episodes when it first started airing and while I typically dont care for cgi quite as much as traditional animation, I liked the show a lot being a TMNT fan)  HONORABLE MENTIONS  * The Mysterious Cities of Gold (this is a much older show, and I have to admit that I have not seen the series my self, but I've heard nothing but good things about it. It is also worth mentioning that a second season is in production and look very very well made, it is how as far as I've seen being produced for France. Should you ever feel the need or want to watch the new one, you may want to watch the first series.. or maybe not)   * Metalocalypse (this its the honorable mentions for a handful of reasons but one of them mostly being 1: its really a mini series of short episodes and 2: season 5 kind of lost track of their characters, and the heart of the show. Seasons 1-4 however were pretty fucking great, season 5 is still pretty entertaining as well)   * Gravity Falls (goofy, fun.. mostly a kids show but entertaining for just about anyone. Mabel is just a doll and shows antics are worth the watch. This is a show that makes Honorable mention because I dont personally hold goofy kids shows in the highest of regards, not to say they're bad, they simply are just not in the same league as shows like korra or wakfu. )  * Attack on Titan (This is a damn cool anime, it gets points for having some of the sharpest, top notch art and animation I've ever seen in a weekly airing TV show, more so Korra, and korra was down right beautiful. Attack on Titan also gets my thumbs up because it doesnt do something almost all animes do, and that is goofy anime antics and facial expressions and general Japanese goofy shit, it avoids that at almost all costs and is series shit all the way through. It gets honorable mention because Its not finished, and I still have no idea wtf is going on with the titans in the show. Certainly recommend checking it out though. )   * Adventure time (this one gets honorable mention only because, yes it is good and interesting and all that jazz but you know it exists and I need not explain it)   * Bravest Warriors (made by the same guys who threw together adventure time, bravest warriors is a Youtube exclusive of shorts mostly for adults as it has quite a bit of adult content and is not intended for children. take a look at their projects over at their youtube channel ""Cartoon Hangover"", good stuff.)    I could probably add more, including a list of animated movies and so forth.   anywho its 4am and i should get to bed. I'll fix typos and fatfingers in some time later when the sun is up.   edit: some more   how could i forget:  * X-men evolution (easily one of the best x-men shows made, and I'd go so far as to argue one of if not the best Marvel animated series ever made.)   * Thundercats 2012 reboot (This one was had so much potential, of what exists of the show was pretty great, not sure where or if its still being worked on any more, think it got canned. It starting out great then they stopped airing new episodes for a short while, in that time the korra series and I think tron released along side a handful of other new cartoons and it just kinda dropped off every ones radar, once it came back, no one cared about it any more)   * Teen titans go (newly made teen titan series composed of silly not so actiony antics and goofy non super hero scenarios. Honestly i find this show to be kinda dumb at times, but entertaining and goofy just the same. If you were a huge of the original, its worth checking out, if you were a MEGA fanboy/girl of the original, might want to avoid the rage this may forge for you. )    will post more as they come to mind.   Other shows I recall being decent, have heard good things about exct.. but may not have fully watched.   * Megas XLR ( I recall this one being pretty cool, but i know I have not seen it all)   * Scooby Do Mystery Inc. (I've only seen a handful of episodes and I can tell you that its clear to see the gang has made made its way to the 21st century. Its well made and well written and I've even read it has one of best best endings for an animated series of its class)   * My little Pony ( before you shoot me.. consider that it has WAY too many followers, I personally dont understand why it has the fan base it does but whatever.. I can say that I watched the first two or 3 episodes and it is in fact a very well made and well put together show. Animation is smooth and fun to watch, art is clear, clean, and colorful. I couldnt sit through any more though because the content of the show was so clearly written and designed for little girls that I simply could not take any other episode. Now that being said, if i had to guess I'd say the later episodes/seasons are likely written with their originally unintended audiences in mind. I have a friend who claims the show has many nerdy/geeky references and jokes in it now since the start but I cannot personally confirm this. Doesnt hurt to catch an episode or two and see how the boot fits, we all have our guilty pleasures, maybe my little pony is yours.)   * Star Wars Clone Wars (There is a traditional and a cgi series, the traditional animated series came I think a few years before the CGI series. Cant say i remember much from the TA (traditional animated) but what I can tell you about the CGI series is its Pros: very cool fight scenes, Side characters are fucking bad ass Cons: main characters make me cringe so hard it hurts, the things they have the main characters do and say are even more painful than the script and dialog of all of Starwars episodes 1-3 combined.   * Loony tunes back in Action: ( think Frasier+cast of loony tunes. This show is by no means your traditional Loony tunes from the golden age of animation but is pretty entertaining and worth a try. The show is goofy and has its fun moments. My biggest gripe is that it fits the sitcom formal so strongly it just seems kinda odd as an animated show. That being said, when the show is able to bring us content like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un6u6y3EuR0 .. its certainly worth a look see..)   * Green Lantern CGI series ( As a GL fan, at first I very much disliked the over simplification of the green lantern corps and how everything fit together, was also not a huge fan of the art style went with. After about a year of passing it up I finally decided to watch it and it turned out not so bad, not my favorite series but certainly a good watch in between waiting for more desired series to start airing again)   * Samuri Jack. (probably a series I should have seen through to its end, however it didnt really end, and I am personally reluctant to start a series I fully know going in does not have an ending thus no closure. I first started watching this show when I was younger, however I quickly got tired of Jack only slicing and dicing robots and robotic appendages. There is something you have to respect about some one whos both skillful and fearless enough to risk him self to inflict fatal wounds on another, the show never crossed that line into having jack actually use his sword on living beings and that kind of removed some of the seriousness of the show for me. It being on a network for children, it was understandable, however I lost interest for that reason just the same.   * Symbiotic Titan (another show brought to us by the minds behind Samuri Jack. Unfortunately it suffered the same fate as Jacks. A well made show that never got finished.   * Barbie™ Life in the Dreamhouse (I've watched one, maybe two episodes of this show and while I am not about to throw caution to the wind and just drive right into this series, I can say that I laughed really hard at the very obvious adult jokes in the episode I did watch. If this is something you can watch, its a guilty pleasure if I've ever seen one lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SigMOvd1hLY  thats enough.. its late.. i dont know why i didnt go to bed.  ",™

t5_2rbuf,Loisdenominator,1377352554,"That awkward feeling when you feel you've just stumbled onto /r/electronic_cigarette  I'll just leave [this](http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-other-methods-of-quitting) here: &gt;In 2004, a Chinese company started making a refillable “cigarette” with a battery and an electronic chip in it. It’s designed to look like a cigarette, right down to the glowing tip. When the smoker puffs on it, the system delivers a mist of liquid, flavorings, and nicotine that looks something like smoke. The smoker inhales it like cigarette smoke, and the nicotine is absorbed into the lungs.  &gt;The electronic cigarette, or e-cigarette, is sold with cartridges of nicotine and flavorings. Several brands and varieties of the e-cigarette are now sold in the United States. The e-cigarette is usually sold as a way for a smoker to get nicotine in places where smoking is not allowed, but some have sold it as a way to quit smoking. The cartridges are sold as having different doses of nicotine, from high doses to no nicotine at all.  &gt;The e-cigarette has no published clinical trials that suggest it might work as a way to help smokers quit. No clinical trials have been submitted to the FDA. As of late 2011, the courts determined that the FDA could regulate e-cigarettes like they do other tobacco products, under the Tobacco Control Act. But if e-cigarettes are marketed for therapeutic purposes (such as quitting smoking), they would be regulated as drugs and/or devices.  &gt;The American Cancer Society has not taken a position on whether electronic cigarettes should be banned from the US market.  &gt;There are questions about how safe it is to inhale some substances in the e-cigarette vapor into the lungs. The ingredients in e-cigarettes are not labeled, so the user doesn’t know what’s in them. The amounts of nicotine and other substances a person gets from each cartridge are also unclear. The manufacturers say that the ingredients are safe, but it’s not clear if they are safe to inhale — many substances that are safe to eat can harm delicate tissues inside the lungs.  &gt;Information from the FDA suggests that e-cigarettes are not always safe. A 2009 analysis of 18 samples of cartridges from 2 leading e-cigarette brands found cancer-causing substances in half the samples. There were other impurities noted as well. For example, diethylene glycol, a toxic ingredient found in antifreeze, was found in one sample.  &gt;Information from the same testing suggests that there may be manufacturing problems with some brands of e-cigarettes. Nicotine levels from each puff varied a great deal, even between cartridges labeled as having the same nicotine amounts. Testing also found small amounts of nicotine in most of the cartridges labeled nicotine-free.  &gt;Like other forms of nicotine, the e-cigarettes and nicotine cartridges can be toxic to children or pets. They can also pose a choking hazard.  &gt;Electronic cigarettes are now being used differently from when they were first introduced. Some sellers offer liquids that can be added to e-cigarette systems as a way to take in drugs other than nicotine. For instance, they advertised Cialis® (tadalafil) could be put into inhalation cartridges and “smoked.” Some companies have offered vitamins and an unapproved drug that is supposed to curb cravings and appetite. The FDA has warned at least one US company about this, but new sellers are cropping up in countries with less stringent drug laws.",®

For instance, keep her food bowls full and in the same place, keep her routine as predictable as possible, prevent the dog from chasing her, close blinds on windows and doors so she isn’t upset by cats outside. If you can’t eliminate sources of stress, try to reduce them.

t5_2s7tt,omdufro,1377371519,"**1).** Laziness / apathy is an underlying, pre-existing condition which weed - or Facebook, Reddit, daydreaming about the leaf that just floated by, or any number of other things - can exacerbate, but which is/are not necessary to initiate it. Simply put, if you don't feel like doing work / going to class / being productive... you probably won't be.  **2).** Various strains of high CBD / low THC composition cannabis are actually shown to provide, among other things, a stimulating, mind-clearing, productivity promoting effect, as opposed to a traditional stoner-esque result, thus disproving the ignorant ""all weed is bad and will make you lazy!"" stereotype once again. To be fair, such strains are often medical (the above-mentioned ""other things"" they treat include epilepsy, for example), so you may not just be able to get them any old place, but still... it's something to consider.  **3).** The ""get up, go to work, come home, go to bed, repeat for 60 years, then die"" cycle, coupled with crippling unemployment and the slowly dawning realization that The American Dream™ as it is and has been represented is either a gross misrepresentation or an outright lie probably has much more to do with the way people are now (listless, apathetic, confused) than pot does, or ever did.   People smoke because it makes them feel good. You want to get their attention? Replicate that feeling in the classroom and the job market. Show us how what we ***already enjoy doing*** can be turned into something mutually beneficial -  useful and productive for you and society as a whole, yet mentally + emotionally stimulating / fulfilling and financially profitable for us. Don't just grind us down all the time to make us fit into society's little pre-fab boxes and expect us to run on a wheel until you replace us with the next cog in the machine.  **4).** Smokers, don't shit where you eat. Don't irresponsibly mix work and leisure, esp. if you're a doctor or an electrician or something sensitive like that. You can't toke (and raid Taco Bell after) if you're dead, in jail, or penniless.

t5_2rfec,Winterspark,1377383830,"I don't know if I feel ""empowered"" or not, but I know I usually feel better about myself and the game/character when they are female over being male. Part of it is just the sheer magnitude of games that force you into being male, so any chance to be female is something I jump at. Another part is that as a pre-transition trans woman, it is almost literally my only way to be perceived as female in my life. Call it escapism (which it may very well be), but when I can pretend to be Jade (Beyond Good &amp; Evil), the girl from Mirror's Edge, or any number of the women in the Create Your Own Character™ types of games, I can feel more female than when people call me sir or I hear my voice or any number of other triggers that show I'm not like most women. Blegh, sorry to be such a downer.  I remember back in the early days of Pokémon. I had owned and beaten Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver. Logged hundreds of hours into it all. I was starting to get bored of the game's formula and figured I'd skip the next game. Cue Pokémon Crystal, the first Pokémon game that allowed you to pick the sex of the person you play as. I bought that game at launch, solely because I could be a girl in it. That was literally the only reason I wanted it. For once I could be a Pokémon Master who was a *girl*, which was the best possible thing ever for my 14 year old self.",™

t5_2qyt6,highguy420,1377384085,"And now you see why I said it was such a perfect word choice of yours.  It is both a fabricated object, which you cannot deny, and it is also used to deceive us because they do not provide full disclosure as to the nature of the instruments.  Let me explain.  A negotiable instrument is generally used to transfer title of real goods or commodities from one person to another.  Take a Bill of Lading for example.  I put a ton of rice onto a ship and give the bill of lading to the captain written to the order of ""mikelj"".  The captain of the ship has the goods, and an order to deliver them to you, and did not have to buy the goods from me because he does not own them.  He is simply entrusted with the goods and paid to deliver them.  You show up and he hands over the goods.   Now let's look at how that works with money.  When an institution such as a government of a nation wants to pay its workers they have to have real goods, such as gold, silver, or historically in the United States, hemp.  If they don't want to deal with the actual commodities they can instead write Notes, or promises to pay.  Then the person can take that note to a bank or proprietor of a warehousing or trading institution or the appropriate government office, collect gold or silver or whatever commodity the certificate is for, and have been PAID.  The instrument was not an intermediate currency, it was simply a note, a negotiable instrument.   When the government passed the law saying that they would no longer pay out real goods in exchange for their negotiable instruments, and demanded all gold certificates be turned into the treasury department to be exchanged for Federal Reserve Notes they changed something fundamental about the way our economy works.  The instruments they were passing off as ""money"" were no longer promises to pay.  They do not meet the definition of a Negotiable Instrument.  They are simply tokens of account at a private bank.  A Target® Brand gift card has more equity backing it than a Federal Reserve Note.    Federal Reserve Notes have no value.  They are not traditional negotiable instruments as defined by law, because they are a promise to pay nothing.  They are by their own definition valueless.

I don't know what it was but we just clicked and we knew we were going to be part of each others life somehow. Our thing was 6:30 am breakfast at Brower (RU)...lol Now he makes my coffee and breakfast every morning. We didn't start to date until after college. We would usually go to dinner and a movie few times a month (even when we were dating other people), and one night after he was dropping me off home he asked me if he can get a kiss good night... hehehe I told him no! So, the next day he called and he said he was serious about the kiss and I told him he has to take me on a date. We have been together ever since then. I love dating him and being married to him!

Simply by seeing your avatar perform actions your brain perceives it as being another person, just like watching a movie. That's why even action movies spend so much time trying to make you like the main protagonist and hate the bad guys, they need you to identify with them before anything that happens to them can have any meaning.   With games we have this amazing opportunity to skip all that and put you right in the shoes of the character, making that character an extension of yourself by giving you the freedom to control it how you see fit.

More complete descriptions of this procedure are available in print and on audiotape. For a reference list and reprint availability please see http://www.andrewleeds.net/.  Precautions when considering Resource Development and Installation RDI procedures should only be used by trained EMDR clinicians and only after both screening for a dissociative disorder and a careful assessment of the patient’s adult attachment status, affect and state change tolerance.  As in the use of standard EMDR procedural steps, it is essential to screen patients for a dissociative disorder before offering RDI. Use of RDI may put unprepared patients with dissociative disorders at risk of in-session or post-session disturbances. It is possible to use RDI with patients who meet criteria for a Dissociative Disorder, but this should only be considered in accordance with criteria described in Shapiro, 2001, Chapter 4 and Appendix B and the Guidelines of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation (http://www.issd.org/indexpage/isdguide.htm). Also, some patients with histories of early neglect, who may present with a Dismissing or Unresolved-disorganized insecure attachment style (Main, 1996; Stein et al., 1998), have been reported as demonstrating inadequately developed capacities to tolerate and modulate positive affects. During RDI procedures, these patients may show no change or negative responses such as confusion or increasing anxiety due to rapid state changes. These patients also may show delayed negative after-effects from RDI procedures. Alternate strategies should be carefully considered in these cases.   References  Korn, D. L., &amp; Leeds, A. M.

Some games, such as Spore, don't give you a choice of language at all, in that case the shopping cart page will again tell you which languages you get:  &gt; SPORE™ Labor &gt; &gt; Direkter Download: Englisch (Amerika), Englisch (Europa), Dänisch, Niederländisch, Französisch, Deutsch, Italienisch, Norwegisch, Polnisch, Portugiesisch (Portugal), Spanisch, Schwedisch   For some games getting the German and English version at the same times seems impossible on Origin without buying the game twice.",™

After seeing them for the first time in Vienna, Austria, we (3 friends) meet in the afternoon the day after the show and drove 350 kilometers to their next show in Berchtesgaden (Germany). It was awesome. A few year later my brother and I flew to London to see them, and to our suprise they played a second show in the London suburbs the day after. That was when i got my self-made messenger bag signed. It is starting to be worn out, but i still love it :-) I first listened to Streetlight Manifesto in November 2005, and today, nearly 8 years after I first fell in love with their music, I booked my flight for me, my girlfriend and my brother to fly to New Jersey to see the last two shows of the ""End of the Beginning"" tour in the Starland Ballroom.

From the official press release (I do a bit of games media writing, so I get tons of these),   ""DICE, an award-winning studio of Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) and developer of the blockbuster Battlefield franchise, today announced that fan-favorite Mirror's Edge is in early stages of development. Mirror's Edge was first introduced in 2008 and fans quickly elevated the game's heroine ""Faith"" into a videogame icon. Gamers and critics worldwide praised its unique characters, highly stylized world and fresh take on first person action adventure. The new Mirror's Edge *reboots the franchise* for the next generation with advanced visuals and an all-new origin story for Faith. Powered by DICE's proprietary Frostbite™ technology, the game will be heading to Xbox One, the all-in-one games and entertainment system from Microsoft, the PlayStation 4, and PC.""",™
t5_2qmg3,zombiexsp,1377442815,"Sorry if I misconstrued my point. I characterized top 15 and great as the same. I should have just said very good instead of great. And you actually illustrate why I think he could do that very well.   A good/great QB on a bad team  ☑ gets sacked a lot  ☑ receivers don't come open  ☑ those that do drop the ball  That is a perfect description of our team last year. You says Sanchez ""airmails"" his passes, but I don't notice that at all. I see him making hasty decisions at bad times. I notice him throwing to a receiver expecting him to run a completely different route than what Sanchez expects. (Probably because we didn't have a receiving corps play more than 2 games in a row and the guys we brought in couldn't learn the system in a couple days.) And I saw him constantly being interrupted any time he gets any rhythm to let Tebow come on the field to run his fucking 2 yards up the middle. Combine this all and it leads to a dramatic drop in confidence and overall, awful play.   And Holmes is a great receiver. He was the only guy giving Sanchez a reliable outside target. In his 2.5 games he played he had 270 yards. I'm really confused how you could say the offense was so bad he quit trying. He was injured almost all of last year and the year before we weren't too terrible offensively.  Ha, never thought I would actually be defending Sanchez that adamantly. With all that said, he does have a lot of problems. A shit ton of them are fucking annoying as hell. But they're fixable. If he was drafted by a team that had reliable management I think his career would be very different right now.",☑

t5_2sgcr,craftyPseudonym,1377450171,"Is your system calibrated correctly? Garmin is only capable of utilising up to 5 spatial dimensions at once for navigation purposes (or 4, if it's a really old model). You have to make sure that you set the right ones, because factory settings are typically x, y, z, Δ, and γ. This may be inaccurate because I am unsure of your destination, but a good standard orientation is along the axes of ♠, y, ξ, ♫, and Jeff.

t5_2r81c,ianmalcolm2,1377450263,"&gt; If you're implying that racetams are placebo, ask people who I've shared noopept with.  Perhaps the above is being taken slightly out of context, but read this sentence a couple more times, and the error becomes more than apparent: *the plural of anecdote is not data.* It's perfectly possible (and in fact more than likely) that your friends were primed by your descriptions of magic work-hard AMP-up-akine pills.   &gt;It can be axiomatic that taking ibuprofen will reduce pain because we have subjective experience to show this.  This is not in any way axiomatic. Axioms are, by definition, first principles. The effects of drugs must be determined by rigorous well-designed testing and backed by huge amounts of experimental evidence. Go to PubMed and search ibuprofen, and you'll see the sheer numbers they have to back the evidence.   I'm not 'trying to be a huge dick', and I *do* see the theoretical possibility for racetam compounds' mechanism of action, but hear me out: **Given the way this sub works, no amount of anecdotal reports here, however similar in their conclusions regarding a given compound, can EVER count as verification or evidence. EVER.** Literally everybody who has read more than a few posts about a given compound, read some product descriptions on a vendor's website, etc., is corrupted by the massive amount of placebo-priming that exists in the background of these discussions, and drives the supplement business. **There is no such thing as exemption from placebo by recognizing it. Meta-placebo *is* placebo, albeit a more sneaky and insidious variety that sneaks into the heads of people who think they're exempt.** This, arguably, is why vendors themselves use, as their primary marketing strategy in selling these powders, the 'appearance' of scientific veracity.  Huge-scale, double- or triple-blinded testing of racetam-naive people is the only way to go with regard to proving anything re: these compounds, and a large percentage of the population on this sub are placebo-ing themselves into a hole, and then being suckered into buying 5 or 6 different expensive compounds because of it.   If you step back and think about 'smartness' itself, and not 'the idea of taking a bunch of fancy science™ pills to get smart', the necessity of a much more open mindset quickly becomes apparent, and this includes the ability to ask yourself, every now and again, while sitting at your lil' capping station or whatever, *'what in the fuck am I doing with my time!? Is this a compulsive and weird behaviour? Why do I spend so much money on powders?*. Of course, this reasoning can apply to any activity, but you see my point.   That being said, I'll descend from the 'ivory tower' I'm accused of inhabiting and admit that  caffeine and theanine is dope and helps me focus. The effects I 'feel' from this combo could be 80% placebo, but at least my placebo-primer is as cheap as a cup of green tea that's already delicious.",™

Warren is unlikely to get those massive donations if she is principled and believes in what she says. If she isn't, then she'll be a female Obama. Change I can believe in, my ass.  And never forget that republicans are making it harder and harder for liberals to win elections even though the republican voter base is shrinking. They were (can't remember if it actually happened) trying to make states that typically vote democratic in presidential elections have split electoral college votes. So Ohio which is close to 50/50 will end up sending 50% of their electoral college votes to Republicans, instead of winner take all. Yet Republican leaning states with a significant Democratic presence (like my state Georgia) will still be winner take all, giving the Republicans 100% of those electoral college votes.  It is very likely that republicans will continue to win elections even though their voter base is crumbling. American Democracy™",™

t5_2qh0u,girlgetsbikeback,1377471747,"Hey Reddit,  I’m the girl who had her bike stolen in Vancouver, and met up with the guy selling it online and took it for a “test ride” and never came back. Since so many people said they wanted gone wild, and tits or GTFO I thought you guys might appreciate an album of my splits around the world. I wish I knew a site like this existed and I would have documented all of my splits around the world. But here an album of the ones I’ve got.  Hope you like.  That said, I got a lot of flack for my Facebook post and the fact I didn’t involve police in getting my bike back. This is actually how the event went down. This isn’t a sob story. Stop reading now if you’re not interested. Bothers me that so many people had negative things to say but all the love and positivity was amazing.   First this is how it happened. I had my bike stolen from my friend’s house on Wednesday night. I posted on Facebook that I was disappointed and sad because I had worked so hard for the bike. I absolutely love love love my bike. So needless to say I was choked. I woke up the next morning and made two calls. The first one was to the police to make a stolen bike report. The lady I spoke with told me I would receive a call later from an officer who would be doing a follow up report. The second was to the bike store RIDE ON to get my serial numbers.   An hour later my friend calls me and says “dude I think I found your bike craigslist” she gave me the number and I looked at the post. He has posted from an address that was 2 blocks from where it was originally stolen. Immediately I called the police again and told them the information I received from my friend. The lady told me that someone would call me back and it might not be today. THIS GUY IS SELLING MY BIKE RIGHT NOW!!! I am not missing this opportunity waiting for a call. So I jump into action.   I called the guy up and made arrangements to meet him in half an hour at the main street McDonalds. (McDonalds, yes, McDonalds) When I pulled into the parking lot I still had no plan of attack. I got there and saw the guy with my bike. He was wearing board shorts, a raggy tank top and dark sketchy glasses. I noticed that it was my bike right away because of the RIDE ON stickers on the frame and the fact I have a silver handle bar plug on the left and a black one on the right. A description I gave to the police already. Here is where I started thinking on my feet.  I asked the guy if I could take it for a ride around the parking lot. He was weary and said “yeah but don’t take off…” I said not to worry that I would even think of it! My heart was pounding and I had no idea what to do so I just got on the bike and was like fuck this guy and started to ride. As I was riding away, I called my friend who was driving to meet me as backup. I rode to the adjacent parking lot where she was pulling into as I was riding. We watched the guy start to look for me and he got super freaked out and he suddenly just took off running.   Three construction workers who had watched the whole thing go down, made comments like ‘we knew something was up, there is no way a guy like that owns a bike like that.’ They watched me walk up and then just ride away. To be honest I was shaking and freaking out. I hands down couldn’t believe what the fuck just happened.   I posted my pic on Facebook with a comment. But everyone wanted to know what happened. So when I wrote that story my adrenaline was still pumping and obviously my phone auto corrected McDonalds to McDonalds because of a friends last name in my phone. I obviously know how to spell McChicken, McRibs, McFREAKING MCDONALDS!!! :) (Sorry for the rant, I spent some time reading comments last night. There were some harsh comments. My friend who posted it for me just laughed.) I probably shouldn’t have called for justice and posted his #, but, I was still amped up.  I looked at my bike after my girlfriend took the picture of me grinning ear to ear and noticed he’d pimped it out for me by putting on some extra lights. (for those who thought it was a fake story because they couldn’t see the lights, there is a green light on my seat post and a small blue light hanging from my right handle bar. They are tough to see in the picture but they are there. )   After that I called him and personally left him a message apologizing for not sticking around to pay him for the bike HE FUCKING STOLE FROM ME!!! (insert a bunch expletives.) I went home and checked my serial numbers, which of course matched. I looked his phone number up on craigslist and noticed that he was selling a bunch of bikes and iPhones as well. I called crime stoppers and gave them all the information I had, and I called the police back to let them know I didn’t need to file that report after all. The lady and I had a great laugh about the day’s events.   So that’s what actually happened. Full story. For those of you that supported me thank you so much. It was amazing to get my bike back for those of you that didn’t and ripped me apart; you can kiss my ass. http://i.imgur.com/aPRnkk7.jpg ☺ (NSFW)   ",☺

t5_2qh1f,spyder93090,1377476563,"I would say that the general gaming community (and maybe even most Mac users) would say that the MacBook Pro may not be the best gaming platform. Unless you're planning to dual boot, most games aren't supported on OS X.  As for video editing, I would recommend either a 15"" ®MBP with 16GB of RAM. The Retina Display is gorgeous to work on at the sacrifice of space (the 768GB option is, I believe, a ~$900 premium). Additionally, because the RAM is soldered directly onto the logic board, the RAM is permanent. Not upgradeable like the non-retinas. Go 16GB right off the bat.  The 15"" non-retina will save you a bit of money and will allow you to use a traditional HDD which is able to hold more for less (a 1TB HDD will run you about $70), very useful for video.  Difference is negligible for general everyday tasks IMO until you start running a plethora of apps simultaneously. Especially video editing in FCPX, that's where you will notice the best use of RAM.",®

I realise there's little point trying to defend such a position in /r/programming given the prevalence of Python fans among our number, but I'll give it a shot.  I personally think it works Just Fine™ for small configuration files (e.g. YAML), meta-markup languages (HAML, JADE, etc) and simple Python programs.  As soon as it gets longer than a page or two it becomes increasingly difficult to manage.

t5_2qhyq,claaria451,1377536396,"First of all thanks for choosing this piece :) .  &gt;Is this classical, jazz, or both?  I think it is a successful combination of the two genres, because it sounds  natural (I mean authentic) and not forced, which can happen often when you try to mix two genres. Besides that you can say it is performed  by both jazz pianists (Andre Previn) and classical pianists (Hélène Grimaud).   &gt;Given that this was Gershwin's first attempt at orchestrating his own work, how successful was he? Could he really have taught himself orchestration from textbooks in just a couple of years? In spite of his best efforts, do Gershwin's works simply sound better when performed in jazzier arrangements?  He did a great job! There is not one point in the score where i personally would say he could have done it better. I think that because the concerto is easy to listen to. Everything is at the right place at the right time, Gershwin never looses the thread. Is is amazing that someone who never had formal training was able to achieve that. A musical genius in his own way... , but that is just my opinion.    Oh and i disagree with the point that his works generally sound better in jazzier orchestras. I view them as musical monuments of the time. Gershwin himself intended to call this piano concert the ""New York Concerto"" and that is exactly it. A musical picture of New York during the roaring, wild 1920s, a city which never sleeps, with fast vehicles and millions of people. The concert would loose a lot of its grandiose effect with a smaller jazz ensemble and without the immensely romantic string parts in it.   &gt;How does this piece compare to the earlier Rhapsody in Blue? Which do you prefer, and why?  I prefer this one over the Rhapsody in Blue because its longer and i can't get enough of this Jazzy/Classy Mix music . In all seriousness though, i like this piece a little bit (tiny tiny tiny littlebit) more because the 2nd movement is just amazing with its funny main theme. It really is music for a good mood and it brightens my day every time i listen to it :). Rhapsody in Blue is still a marvelous piece, but it is a bit more serious than this one.    &gt;Is Gershwin neglected outside of the US? If so, why? Are Americans better at performing his work?  Is Gershwin neglected outside of the US? I never noticed that. And this music is international and can be played by someone from every nationality. Although i like André Previns version most and he is half-american,  Hélène Grimauds performance is still very good.

Gershwin is probably the best known composer from the states, because his works are easier to access than the works from other composers. Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, John Adams and Samuel Barber are only known for a few of their pieces (The unanswered question, Appalachian Spring, Short Ride in a Fast Machine and Adagio for Strings). Oh and he is from the 1920s a time which basically marks the uprising of the United States, when Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty became world famous symbols and American culture began to spread all over the world, together with jazz.

t5_2qs0q,farmerje,1377543813,"I think /u/PilotPirx's answer is dangerous because it conflates lots of things that are easy for a beginner to conflate but shouldn't be, e.g., deploying a website (perhaps via FTP) and [revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control).  /u/MatekCopatek's answer is much better.  Here's my ELI5 attempt.   First, I'm going to tell you a story and present you with a problem.  This is the problem tools like git &amp;mdash; called [version control systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) &amp;mdash; are meant to solve.  Have you ever worked on a document or a collection of documents with another person or a group of people?  It might be a single word document or it might be a folder containing a bunch of documents, e.g., a website with HTML, CSS, and other things.  Let's say there's single text-only document that contains an outline for a larger project we're collaborating on called `outline.txt`.  We both need to edit it and, more importantly, we need to understand the edits the other person has made so that the larger project doesn't suffer.  We already have a problem, viz., how do both of us edit `outline.txt`?  You might call this the ""synchronization problem"" and it has two dimensions.  First, how do we send our edits to `outline.txt` to each other?  Second, how do we reconcile the changes we've made to `outline.txt`, especially if they conflict or I disagree with edits you've made?  Remember, in this situation we're editing a single file and there are only two people involved in the editing process (you and me).  I edit `outline.txt`, save it as `outline_v1.txt`, and email it to you.  You make your edits to `outline_v1.txt`, save it as `outline_v2.txt`, and email it back to me.  But crap, I sent you `outline_v1.txt` a few hours but I forgot some important edits, so I open `outline_v1.txt` and save it as `outline_v2.txt` and send you that new one.  You get my `outline_v2.txt`, but in the meantime you've made your own edits and also saved it as `outline_v2.txt`.  You haven't emailed it to me yet, though, so you take my `outline_v2.txt` and judiciously integrate its edits into your `outline_v2.txt, save it as `outline_v3.txt` and email it to me.  All this emailing is getting tedious.  You suggest setting up an FTP server or a shared network drive.  But what happens if I'm about to upload `outline.txt` to the FTP server and you've been making edits in parallel?  What happens if you don't think twice and upload your edits to the FTP server, obliterating mine?  Maybe we agree that every time one of us uploads a file we give it a special name like `outline_v2.4_farmerje_edits.txt`.  What we're doing here is a bit of abstracting, actually.  Conceptually you and I agree there's one ""abstract"" document called `outline.txt` and files like `outline_v2.4_farmerje_edits.txt` are *versions* of that document.  The most recently-uploaded file is the version we're both aware of, but of course we might have local versions that we're editing, haven't uploaded yet or never intend to upload because they were rough drafts.  You could imagine me asking you, ""Hey, can I see the rough draft you're working on?""  We probably also agree never to go back and retroactively edit a version we've uploaded to the FTP server.  If we want to make an edit we should download the most recent version, edit it, and upload a new version with a new name.  **The Problem**  Hopefully you can see that the conversation we're having is centered around this question: ""What are we to do when we have a single document with multiple versions edited by multiple people?""  Right now the ""system"" we're using is a conglomeration of multiple smaller software and non-software systems, e.g.,  1. Some mechanism to transmit versions, e.g., email, FTP, Dropbox, carrier pigeons with flash drives, etc. 2. A set protocols you and I agree to so that we're careful not to step on each others' toes, e.g., special file names, a promise never to retroactively edit a file, etc.  Hopefully you can see that it might be worth building some software dedicated specifically to solving this collaboration and synchronization problem.  That's what version control systems like git are for!  **Version Control Systems** Per /u/MatekCopatek's answer, here are some vocabulary words so we can establish a common language.  git is used for revision control (aka version control or source control), which is a way of tracking incremental changes to a collection of documents (typically source code) over time.  Tools like git are therefore called ""version control systems"" or VCS.  Other version control systems include [Subversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), [CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), [Mercurial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial), [BitKeeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper), and [Perforce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce).  You might have heard that git is a ""distributed"" version control system.  Don't worry about this for now.  There are lots of ways we might build a version control system.  Here's a naïve one that spares us the trouble of worrying about what happens when two people are working on the same file: build a new network service that allows users to upload files but to edit a file you have to ""check it out.""  While a file is checked out, nobody else can modify it.  When you're done editing the file, you ""check it in"" and other folks can now check it out.  This sucks because only one person can be editing a file at a time.  And what happens if they make edits but forget to check it back in?  Do checkouts expire?  If so, how do you differentiate between someone making a big edit and someone who forgot to check the file back in?  This problem becomes worse as the number of people working with the documents increases.  The way most version control systems work does involve a kind of ""checking out.""  You have some remote collection of documents on a server that represents The True State of the Universe™ and you have your local copy of that remote collection.  You make edits on your local collection.  When you're done you tell the server, ""Here are the changes I've made.  Please integrate them.""  This is often called ""pushing"", ""pushing your changes"", or ""pushing your local copy.""  **Important thing to understand**: when you push your changes you're not pushing *everything* in your local copy, you're only pushing the differences between your local copy and whatever the latest thing you pulled down.  In most version control systems for source code, these changes are transmitted using [diffs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff).  Now, it's possible you and I were working on the same documents locally.  When I go to push my changes the server might reply, ""Sorry, someone else has pushed their changes since you last made a copy of the remote code!""  You'll then somehow be given the option to reconcile your local changes with the remote changes before you push.  That said, these changes can often be reconciled automatically.  For example, if you and I edited entirely different files, the version control system can integrate both of our changes without any trouble.  What happens if we edited some of the same files?  Typically version control systems will try to merge our edits together.  See [the Merge page on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_\(revision_control\)].  The basic idea is this: even if we're editing the same file, if you and I edit different lines in that file it's still possible to automatically reconcile our respective changes.  **git vs. everything else**  Git is a ""distributed"" source control system.  At this point you probably have in your head the idea of a central repository of code that folks are making copies of, editing, and pushing changes into.  This isn't really how git works and in that sense there's no True State of the Universe™.  Other version control systems like Subversion and CVS *do* work this way.  git was created by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who also created [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).  The folks who contribute to the [Linux kernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) live all over the world.  More importantly, while the kernel is in development, there are many ""sub-versions"" of the Linux kernel, e.g., a branch with a bunch of experimental performance work, a custom fork by a particular vendor, etc.  For security reasons alone, how is this supposed to work?  Does everyone have permission to push code to a central Linux source code repository?  If not, how do changes get transmitted?  No, we'd like all the benefits of version control, but not have to think about any of that.  We should all be using the same version control system, but be able to push and pull from each other.  Maybe we create a way so that I signal to you that I have local changes you might want to pull into your local copy?  That's how distributed version control systems work.  For a given repository only a limited number of people have the right to push code directly into the repository, but anyone can submit a pull request.  Because we're both using the same version control system it's as easy as saying, ""Hey git, please pull from /u/erdemece's repository and merge their changes into mine.""  So, distributed version control makes a ton of sense for open source projects like the Linux kernel.  For a while the Linux kernel developers used a proprietary version control system called [BitKeeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper).  After a bit of drama around an open source project using a closed source version control system that caused the BitKeeper developer to change the BitKeeper license in a way that made it impossible to use with the Linux kernel, Linus said, ""Fuck this, I'm inventing [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_\(software\)).""  And now, here you are, asking, ""WTF is this git thing?""  Hope that helps!",™

t5_2t2zt,evilstickman,1377549250,"NOTE – I’ve written a novel here. I apologize for the length. I minored in philosophy in college, and a professor of mine would always joke that a philosopher couldn’t sneeze in less than two thousand words.  &gt; (This is the best conversaton I've had about feminism with a dissenter, ever.)  (Parenthesized to prevent derailment of the original line of discussion. It strikes me that one of the primary reasons that this is the case is that the question of gender equality is in every way an emotionally-charged issue. For example, my first instinct was to object to the “dissenter” label as I most certainly do not view myself as such. As I thought about it, though, I realized that this was my knee-jerk reaction to the emotional nature of the subject matter. For the record I fully support gender equality, I simply dissent with some of the data and the talking points commonly used to phrase the debate and used as the primary methods of achieving equality. To be honest, I could wax on about the FUD surrounding this issue for far longer than is healthy, and definitely far longer than would hold anyone’s interest. I fully agree, though, that this is definitely one of the best conversations I have had on the subject). &gt; I can completely understand that this overpowering stereotype can often give a very dismal view of feminists. It's my opinion though that this stereotype is actually caused by people who are upset by the premise of feminism (radical dang women-types getting all riled up, wanting to vote and have abortions and stuff), to try and undermine the movement. Maybe I've been lucky in that I've encounted really none of these people in my interbutts time.  This is pointing at the core of the issue right here, I think. Stereotypes have origins. There are definitely men that think that women getting the vote was a crime against nature. And there are certainly women who feel that the only good man is a castrated man. Most of what I’ve read on the way that the human brain functions indicates that it is simply a very, very powerful pattern matching machine. This means that precedence in memory and perception is largely going to go to those things that are abnormal or wildly out-of-line. On top of that, the guided algorithm we use to learn means that our brain is essentially pick and choosing which patterns to match. The practical upshot of this bloviating is that when we run into a feminist who is extremely radical, or a dissenter who is extremely chauvinistic and sexist, the brain latches on to that as a pattern aberration. We like to think that most people are reasonable and logical, and the differences thus stick in our mind more. As a result, when I think of feminism the most readily available perception that comes to mind is that of the radical activist, while when you think about the dissenters the most readily available perception is that of the male chauvinist (please forgive me if I am putting words in your mouth, it is not my intention). In both cases it’s because the ideas in play are so out of our experience that they can’t help but stick.  &gt; This is a link that debunks a few myths about feminism, and explains feminists tackling men's issues  Excellent article, and a good read. However, the author supports directly two of my core points: first, that the radical misandrist feminists (I have lost count of the number of times I’ve had to define misandry for friends and family) get more of the focus simply because they are so loud and angry, and second, that while gender equality is indeed the goal of feminism the focus is exclusive to the female. Couple this with the emotional nature of the subject matter, and hopefully you can see from where my opinions arise.  &gt; Here's one that neatly points out how the majority of feminists think, in contrast to popular opinion against them  I can understand the sentiment that this article is trying to get across, but I have to be honest – I had a hard time getting through it and taking the author seriously at the same time. There is far too much repressed rage in that post, as well as condescension to those with differing opinions. I understand what they’re getting at, but the author just seems averse to a rational discussion of the subject based upon this one sample.  &gt; Cute article about feminism's benefits to men  Good read. I think the author hasn’t done research on some of her talking points (for example, and I apologize for the Wikipedia link, but recent studies have shown that after controlling for other factors such as grades and domestic situations, [the wage gap is closer to 81.5 cents per dollar rather than the 77 cents per dollar that the author claims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male%E2%80%93female_income_disparity_in_the_United_States#Explaining_the_gender_pay_gap)), but I definitely appreciate the view.  &gt; None of these are scientific persay, unfortunately I don't have access to scholarly articles, and google lends itself much quicker to blogs on the topic of humanities.  I’ve lamented this myself frequently when discussing other issues ☺  &gt; Discussion of rape culture, specifically this portion describes it well: &gt; (quote omitted)  Here is my primary problem with the feminist movement as it currently stands. EVERYTHING is defined in terms of gender, it seems. In striving for a society that is blind to gender differences and focuses only on individual potential, this article (and many of the more well-known feminist philosophers that I’ve read) has gone 100% in the opposite direction by framing the entire world in terms of gender differences. A prime example is the deliberate choice of shocking language (“rape culture”, for example, cheapens the concept of rape. A man opening a door for a woman is not part of rape culture, it is a gender-based stereotype.). As a fairly independent observer, it seems to me as though most feminists are attempting to find some sort of “unified theory” of gender power dynamics, and in doing so they are shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. In my opinion, a better approach would be to remove the hyper focus on gender, and instead focus on the inequalities. The difference in FMLA leave for parents, or the wage gap when it is a result of active discrimination as opposed to a lack of desire to negotiate on the part of the people receiving the lower pay, or the removal of all sexist portrayals of men and women from media.  The biggest issue I had with this particular article is the final parenthetical:  &gt; (except when brought up in an attempt to derail conversations about rape culture by people who aren't aware that misogyny underlies crimes of sexual dominance against men as well those against women.)  I apologize for being blunt, but citation needed. How is a woman raping a man rooted in misogyny? How is sexual violation of male students by female teachers being chronically under-punished rooted in misogyny? As I evaluate this I can see that the author has unintentionally made a generalization (it should probably read “who aren’t aware that misogyny underlies some crimes of sexual dominance against men…”), but the problem with this is that due to the emotional nature of the subject material you cannot always rely upon your reader to approach your writing on the subject with an open and empathetic mindset. This is why the terminology being pushed, like “rape culture”, has (in my opinion only) done immense harm to the cause of feminism. For lack of a better way to put it, they’re taking themselves way too seriously, and trying to carry things way too far.  &gt; I'm sorry I don't have more credible sources, but I am willing to discuss my own experiences and opinions on the subject in more depth!  No worries, and I’d be glad to continue the conversation. Provided you can deal with my verbosity! ",☺

But they can't take that character and use him widely across broad distribution for the mass market, primarily because he's the antithesis of what the consumers consider heroic. Plus, Mom and Dad would crap themselves if little Timmy and Cindy ran around the house screaming that the neighbor kids were ""Bastiches"" for cheating at tag.    This way both characters get the benefit of the brand recognition - despite that some additional education will have to happen around the new guy… That's a big ""so what?"" since the majority of consumers in the mass market wouldn't know Lobo from Millie the Model.   DC wins. They get character that is palatable to the majority, and the character has built in name recognition for those that care… The good thing is that DC still keeps the old character on tap so they don't have to lose the equity they have in the original.

It's not unique--I would argue that you can see similar tendencies in, for example, late 19th-century Russia, contemporary Japan, or any northern European state that looked towards the Italian Renaissance for inspiration: countries that are in a way appealing towards other, historically powerful countries, who may or may not really be all that powerful anymore, politically speaking, but whose cultural influence is still dominant, if only out of historical habit. This explains Gershwin's distain towards his more traditional folksy sources in blues and jazz; it didn't appeal to the standard that Gershwin was appealing to, because that wasn't its goal. It was Gershwin's goal (at least in this pieces), and so he judged it against that standard. Obviously it's not an equivalent comparison; apples and oranges, etc.  America is a big place. I'd say that Gershwin might be the Great New York Composer™, but to extrapolate that to cover America as a whole (while certainly flattering to those of us who live here in the city) is to whitewash the cultural diversity of the country. If anything, the fact that he wrote European-style ""art music,"" in addition to showtune songs and ragtimey piano music, strongly places him in New York, which has always traditionally been the American city with the most direct ties to Europe thanks to its status as a hub for recent immigrants. Had he been born and raised in New Orleans, his orchestral music might've sounded more like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_WbQYdQty0). As it is, it's a mishmash of influences from everywhere all at once--European music, black music, folk music, dance music, showtime tunes, with a dash of Fifth Avenue traffic thrown in for good measure--anything at all that might've washed up on the banks of the East River, be it from the South or from across the Atlantic. Like the city itself, the music has no single cultural origin, despite its pretensions to being European; instead, it forges something new out of the collision of many different cultural forces.   As such, he does bring something new to the ""**History of Western Music**""--a unique voice, skillfully realized, and, I would say, distinctly American. From that perspective, it's American because some of its sources are rooted in the American folk tradition (though you could argue that American folk tradition has its own roots elsewhere--in African chants and drumming rhythms, say, or in, I don't know, Irish fiddle music); but compared to, for example, King Oliver linked above, it's likewise pretty damn European, because, from *that* perspective, it's very much influenced by European music. So which is it? Both, and neither.   The ""American-ness"" of the piece is sort of ""pointillist"", then; if you look at it from a distance, the overall impression is distinctly there, but the closer you get, the more tenuous is becomes, until it dissolves completely into vague colors and shapes.

Essentially, he's probably unhappy because he felt he wanted to make a greater impact and didn't get enough time to do so. As I said, I too would be unhappy being subbed off for a defensive player when there's still enough time to score another goal or two.  I wouldn't read too much into his substitution, really.",〽

I'm a pretty open guy so the convo goes 'Hey wife, this person Jane really wants me to walk her around on a leash and take photos of her'. My wife found it intriguing as we're not/weren't really educated on BDSM so we met with a few people, professionals (medical/mental health) and read a recommended book http://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Outsiders-Understanding-Sexualities-Communities/dp/1442217359 and now I'm not so quick to judge people on their fetishes (say, for instance, automatically linking a sexual fetish to a mental illness) and the whole educational experience into BDSM was awesome. Not my/our thing really but I'm happy to understand it rather than judge it. **THAT SAID: No, I STILL don't get the Sharpie thing.** Pain, humiliation, control, leather, role playing, sub, dom...yep, I understand it.

Now, I'm making music all of the time (look for me in ""Batboy, the Musical"" in La Crosse, WI and at the Tangled Hickory wine bar in Viroqua), close to finally finishing school (computer animation, baby!)...and I have a wonderful partner who actually *gets* me who loves to share life and experiences with me, including going to as many shows as possible (including your last Minneapolis show...how you performed with that cold, I'll never know).  I met both you and Neil and Jason and Sxip at yourEvelyn Evelyn show in Minneapolis as well and when I mentioned my Twitter handle you smiled and said, ""Hello how *are* you?""  I felt *known* and like I was not there to see a ""celebrity,"" or ""cult of personality"" but a real person that day (Neil also signed my shoe - it's a joke between me, my daughter, and Dave McKean).  So, if I had a question, I guess it would be - how do you manage to engage with people so well - and in so doing, inspire them?  Obviously, it's got something to do with honesty and bravery (and Charisma), but there's something else.  If you had to ""name it and claim it"" what do you think it would be?  Thanks again, for everything.",™

They just weren't *legendary* designers. If Diablo had never existed and this game was released by *You Never Head of Them Studios®*, it would have been greeted a lot more warmly.  Blizzard has had a lot of brain drain, including all the key talent that produced Diablo II. There's a *reason* that despite multi-million dollar budgets, most games and movies don't achieve greatness, and many aren't even *good*: directors and producers capable of producing greatness are *rare*, and even *they* produce duds from time to time.  Diablo II is one of the most exalted games of all time. Being disappointed that a different team wasn't able to equal it is reasonable, but *expecting* them to is unrealistic. It would be like expecting the next Star Wars movie, produced by Disney, to equal the original trilogy. It's not going to happen. Even Lucas couldn't equal his early works.  It's not like you can press a *Make a Legendary Game* button. It's not a problem you can just throw more dollars at, or every game would be as legendary as Diablo II.  It requires a perfect storm of talent that just didn't exist on Diablo III, and not because Blizzard didn't *want* it to.",®

Make no mistake this was a crime against humanity... but the gas was NOT used by the Syrian government, it was used by the NATO backed rebels.

t5_2qh3l,anonymous-coward,1377633832,"I agree that a little bit of shopping is possible, but mostly with that it's hard to do, especially if you're terribly ill.  Comparison shopping is hard even for simple goods, and assembling a cancer treatment from bits and pieces is well nigh impossible.  Every individual has to create his own base of knowledge, just like every car buyer has to figure out sticker prices and carfax and delivery fees and negotiations.    For a sick person to make decision after decision after decision based on cost optimization is asking too much.  I should have said that a free market works when information is relatively cheap and comparisons are easy.  Most people don't have the intelligence  or education or time or energy to micromanage their medical care.  If they did Tylenol^® would be out of business and generic acetaminophen would be all you can get.  And there's a bit of a contradiction between your first statement that there's a wide range of MRI providers, including cheap ones; and your second statement that a 'certificate of need' severely limits the free market.  Unlimited medical services can be [a problem too](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande), like the example of McAllen Texas, where a cluster of extraordinarily expensive unnecessarily deluxe Medicare-financed medical services coalesced around a poor town.  Yes, you can blame government financing, but you also need to blame the medical industry for expanding solely for the purpose of profit.     Why are these medical centers in McAllen competing to provide Medicare with cheaper services?  Instead, they just provide *more* services, because they decide what services are necessary, and then they sell them.        ",®

After two years, dieters had regained their weight and lost the health improvements, while the HAES group sustained their health improvements.^11  [The Wikipedia article on intuitive eating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitive_eating) also discusses some research.  There isn't a lot of research on the subject yet, so even though it's all been positive, it's nowhere near conclusive. I would be excited to learn of more research on intuitive eating.  Are you aware that intuitive eating is a very mindful practice? Eating when you feel true hunger, stopping at or near the feeling of fullness or satiety, and choosing foods that sound good and healthful to you.  &gt;shouldn't our broad-based societal prescriptions be based around ideas that most people are probably not built to eat both intuitively and healthfully?  So I wouldn't necessarily say ""not built to"" but rather that intuitive eating might be too much of a hassle (being prepared to eat even if at work or whatnot) and require planning (having a variety of foods available in the house) and a lot of mindfulness (paying close attention to bodily cues), all of which might make intuitive eating not worthwhile for many people.  Then again, I'm not sure how easy intuitive eating becomes over time, and I'd love to hear from someone who's practiced it for a while, what their experiences have been.",®

t5_2sj8i,StochasticLife,1377654047,"It sounds harsh because it was intended that way; I'm not sure why you apologized. I am not averse to a discussion on the relative merits of a business decision.   Don't misunderstand my zeal for an abandonment of basic business acumen. This is a *calculated* risk.   In pursuing this, and other tangential, goal/s I've founded a publishing and game design start-up. Niche markets are where we live these days.   Persona is a surprisingly successful franchise when you consider it as whole. There's more than enough interest in the intellectual property to consider it for a product. Further, Atlus fans will buy products simply because they *are* Atlus products. We are assuming that at least *some* of our prospective audience will buy it simply because the brand loyalty and the fact that's kosher (i.e. official).  Further, if done well, and true to the spirit of source material, there's ample room left in the market for paper books. We're going to enhance the experience of the paper book not only with a digital distribution channel, but a mobile device application suite - we are mobile device specialists.   We expect that if we can do it the justice it deserves, that Big Nerd™ will take more than passing interest in the product and help to insure some level of financing.   Personally, I'm working on this not simply as a *fan* but because I feel like I understand all of the disparate elements that go into the overall Persona zeitgeist: Yokai, Vedic mythology, Buddhist theology, the tarot, kabbalah, and Japanese culture. I'm a fan of Persona because I was already in those cultural spaces, it seemed natural.   Writing, good writing, takes time and costs money; likewise with *good* math.   If the cost/benefit ratio works out in our favor, we're going forward, principally to have a quality product with our logo on it. If it doesn't work out, we'll file off the serial numbers and release it directly to the community.   Considering our experience, expertise, and natural interests coupled with the apparent lack of similar or related products in the field, it seemed perfectly suited for us.  But this isn't going to be our first release, this is why I'm posting the update, I know that *some* people around here were interested in what we were doing. At this juncture, the scale and overhead simply isn't something we feel we can do a good service to with realistic expectations.   But we do have *very* realistic expectations. ",™

This sits very very well with EU, but seems to annoy the Russians, who are the major supporters of Assad. As a reminder, we went to Iraq to get this pipeline started (as Rumsfeld promised Saddam many years before).

t5_2s7tt,zan5ki,1377700194,"According to [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/words_in.htm):   &gt; How does a word get into a Merriam-Webster dictionary? &gt;  &gt; This is one of the questions Merriam-Webster editors are most often asked. &gt;  &gt; The answer is simple: usage. &gt;  &gt; **Tracking Word Usage** &gt;  &gt; To decide which words to include in the dictionary and to determine what they mean, Merriam-Webster editors study the language as it's used. They carefully monitor which words people use most often and how they use them. &gt;  &gt; Each day most Merriam-Webster editors devote an hour or two to reading a cross section of published material, including books, newspapers, magazines, and electronic publications; in our office this activity is called ""reading and marking."" The editors scour the texts in search of new words, new usages of existing words, variant spellings, and inflected forms–in short, anything that might help in deciding if a word belongs in the dictionary, understanding what it means, and determining typical usage. Any word of interest is marked, along with surrounding context that offers insight into its form and use. &gt;  &gt; **Citations &gt; ** &gt; The marked passages are then input into a computer system and stored both in machine-readable form and on 3"" x 5"" slips of paper to createcitations. &gt; Each citation has the following elements: &gt; 1.	the word itself &gt; 2.	an example of the word used in context &gt; 3.	bibliographic information about the source from which the word and example were taken &gt; Merriam-Webster's citation files, which were begun in the 1880s, now contain 15.7 million examples of words used in context and cover all aspects of the English vocabulary. Citations are also available to editors in a searchable text database (linguists call it a corpus) that includes more than 70 million words drawn from a great variety of sources. &gt;  &gt; **From Citation to Entry** &gt;  &gt; How does a word make the jump from the citation file to the dictionary? &gt; The process begins with dictionary editors reviewing groups of citations. Definers start by looking at citations covering a relatively small segment of the alphabet – for example gri- to gro- – along with the entries from the dictionary being reedited that are included within that alphabetical section. It is the definer's job to determine which existing entries can remain essentially unchanged, which entries need to be revised, which entries can be dropped, and which new entries should be added. In each case, the definer decides on the best course of action by reading through the citations and using the evidence in them to adjust entries or create new ones. &gt; Before a new word can be added to the dictionary, it must have enough citations to show that it is widely used. But having a lot of citations is not enough; in fact, a large number of citations might even make a word more difficult to define, because many citations show too little about the meaning of a word to be helpful. A word may be rejected for entry into a general dictionary if all of its citations come from a single source or if they are all from highly specialized publications that reflect the jargon of experts within a single field. &gt;  &gt; To be included in a Merriam-Webster dictionary, a word must be used in a substantial number of citations that come from a wide range of publications over a considerable period of time. Specifically, the word must have enough citations to allow accurate judgments about its establishment, currency, and meaning. &gt;  &gt; The number and range of citations needed to add a word to the dictionary varies. In rare cases, a word jumps onto the scene and is both instantly prevalent and likely to last, as was the case in the 1980s with AIDS. In such a situation, the editors determine that the word has become firmly established in a relatively short time and should be entered in the dictionary, even though its citations may not span the wide range of years exhibited by other words. &gt;  &gt; **Size Does Matter** &gt;  &gt; The size and type of dictionary also affects how many citations a word needs to gain admission. Because an abridged dictionary, such asMerriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, has fairly limited space, only the most commonly used words can be entered; to get into that type of dictionary, a word must be supported by a significant number of citations. But a large unabridged dictionary, such as Webster's Third New International Dictionary, has room for many more words, so terms with fewer citations can still be included. &gt;  &gt; **Authority Without Authoritarianism** &gt;  &gt; Change and variation are as natural in language as they are in other areas of human life and Merriam-Webster reference works must reflect that fact. By relying on citational evidence, we hope to keep our publications grounded in the details of current usage so they can calmly and dispassionately offer information about modern English. That way, our references can speak with authority without being authoritarian.  TL;DR Usage is the main reason a word gets put in the dictionary.  ",®

t5_2qhbe,biffysmalls,1377703575,"Landmark. I can't say enough good things about them.  They don't build on-site. Basically, they build the exterior of the home at their climate controlled facility, truck it over to your lot, set it in place and then build the inside. Since it has a permanent foundation it isn't considered modular or manufactured and the guts of the home are never exposed to the elements.  They even have an option now, which we didn't get because it would have tipped the price at over $400k, where you can pretty much make the house carbon neutral, or damn close by installing solar panels on the roof of the house and garage that would get stored in a battery bank in the furnace room. You would use as much power as you wanted to, and once your bank was fully charged, all of the excess would be sold back into the grid. It wouldn't have made you the kind of money a tenant would, but most months it would mean EPCOR would be sending you a cheque instead of an invoice.  We didn't go for it, like I said because it would have tipped the price over $400k and have made it difficult (assuming neither of us ever saw another raise, however unlikely) to have paid it off in 15 years. I have health issues that are under control right now and should remain so for the foreseeable future, but sooner or later, they will cut my career short and thus our household income, and that's where Freedom 45™ was born.

It can apply to a lot of different issues and it's a good way to not let excuses and laziness overpower discipline. To me it meant that my head was making up frightening, ridiculous scenarios so it would scare me into never going outside of my comfort zone and daring to do something that might bring attention to my person or face an awkward situation. Those scenarios turned out to be complete lies. Even if those awkward situations could have ever happened [nope], it was all way too petty in comparison to the benefits I got from lifting to my full capacity and the injuries I have spared myself from.

t5_2sqho,DchozN,1377714130,"I can only comment on that in regard to ESEA LAN tournaments but every single CS: GO player is allowed to communicate to their teammates as much as they want and as long as they want after they get fragged in-game to answer your question.  Effective communication (keyword: effective) is absolutely crucial in CS: GO especially since the in-game sound is still poor, which I'm positive you're well aware of already, and I personally feel limiting players' ability to communicate is counter productive and ultimately leads to less quality matches.  The old school CPL days of being able to talk up until your screen became completely black (fade to black, the other tournament rule that DOES still apply today) after you got fragged have been done away with years ago --- in the context of ESEA LAN tournaments to reiterate.  For example here's a clip of Paul ""Adrenaline"" Baker from Loaded getting an AWP 4K and 1 vs. 1 clutch round to ace H2K Gaming which featured Xizt (who's now in, of course, the legendary NiP team) at the time during ESEA LAN Season 6 &amp; Arbalet Cup Dallas in 2010 which was a double tournament hosted by ESEA thanks to two organizers (Torbull and Arbalet) cooperating with each other.  Although it's CS 1.6 the clip demonstrates effective communication which certainly applies to CS: GO or any other team based FPS game today.  * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngcwomi2rd0&amp;hd=1  Note all of the comms made by his teammates including where the opponents are positioned at right after they got fragged along with the clear and concise verbiage, and also note Steno, the stratcaller / IGL of Loaded at the time, who essentially told Adrenaline what to do when he was dead and by staring at his screen (since his own screen went fade to black).  These are some of the things that get left out in broadcasts of professional CS: GO matches and something I'm figuring out a way to fix.  CS: GO is NOT a game where 10 dudes randomly run around on a map and whoever spots the other guy first gets the frag.  A completely backwards mindset to the game that stems from pure ignorance.  For anyone who would like to watch and listen to a related video such as the above clip then I implore you to watch this one with the Mumble recording itself that's synced to the POV footage of players accordingly as well:  * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM31zmIT5s8&amp;hd=1  Moving on all teams are allowed to use any VOIP program of their choosing at ESEA LAN but 99.9% of them use Mumble.  Some of the reasons why are that it utilizes next to no resources and how it has the lowest latency out of all other programs (plus, for programmers, it's open source and freeware).  So when you use something like Ventrilo there IS some amount of latency.  Although it's in the milliseconds why would you not use a superior, alternate program that simply avoids all of that altogether and then some?  * http://mumble.sourceforge.net  The ESEA Client already has Mumble embedded within it and offers free servers for all ESEA Premium members to use.  In addition since it's mandatory for all players to use the ESEA Client for anti-cheat purposes at ESEA LAN tournaments (obviously), it's all the more reason for teams to use Mumble.  It's my hope that I communicated effectively and brought some clarity to the situation **:D)-&lt;**.  P.S. cbfx from C9: Enemy Down, hicks with sticks, etc?...  **EDIT**: Listen to how compLexity communicates on LAN @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXmCLNKrkq4&amp;hd=1&amp;t=80 (2:05 :D)  *coL Comms™*",™

t5_2qlqk,ravia,1377716154,"Oh, here we go with the usual crap. Don't listen to the lies when they say ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain"", who is, supposedly pulling the strings of materialism to make us buy, buy, buy and be concerned only with material wealth. This load of crap has been foisted on us again and again. There is a man behind the man behind the curtain. He is hiding in plain sight, dancing right in front of the fucking curtain. His name: retributive justice, riddling everything in our culture from CSI dramas, to hip HBO crime sagas, to Mafia worship to Real Life® Lockup Shows to Judge Judy to real world crime dramas to ""Investigation"" shows (read: the stories of grisly murders) to post-Warhol commercialism to the activism out the catch the ""real killers"" to wars to the prisons to righteous religious judgment and on and on. This retributive justice requires above all that violence be seen through a dimmed, dumbed down intelligence, and keeping us dumb the plays right into that marketplace system. But don't think for one minute that West's own spirituality doesn't play a powerful role in this hidden-in-plain-sight sleight of hand, or that MLK's idea of ""the judgment of the content of character"" over ""color of skin"" is by any means a step out of the ugly morass of retribution, simplification, illusion. On the contrary, that spirituality photobombs the prisons every chance it gets while dumbing down activism into the bankrupt form it takes today.  This is *not* simply a market-drive culture. It is a retribution-driven culture as well, and they are all together, in bed, performing multiple forms of coitus. Capitalists like West, who get essentially and existentially rich off of declaiming the state of affairs, are at the helm of the only site where change of possible, systematically suppressing real thought and action. Although I truly do love West, and King, and MLK and Chomsky and Moore et al in many ways, I feel obliged to say what I think. You can just imagine the back room meetings and the methods they'd use to shut me the fuck up were I to go on about this in their meetings. Would that be a red flag? Hell no.   Hell no, I won't go. I'm sitting in the front of this bus, come hell or high water. I smell something rotten to the core in this ruse and illusion, and I am going to go on believing what I believe and not believing how others, with baited breath and salivating jaws, demand. As MLK propounded on about ""character"", those who take him up on that dream's seemingly virtuous ideal stand all too ready to suppress any evidence that character itself has its skin, its differences, just as they stand ready, indeed, to *judge*, in rituals of judgment that play right into the retributive culture that has left us so blind as to give people like West to this kind of account, as able as Occupy, a story that is by no means original, new or progressive. It is the tired refrain, the exhausted, incomplete account, blinding us to the man behind the man behind the curtain, in his judgment machine, her prisons, his wars, her strangulating sociolence, his bombs, her sanctions, his brutal attacks, her exclusions, his sentences, her suicides.

t5_2qh1i,coloicito,1377725538,"I'm not a story teller, so don't expect much from me.  Here's my take:  Year 2034.  The confederation of Reddit has emerged as the new world power. After almost 30 years of shared knowledge, and billions of users around the world, the admin's call to arms was heard all over the globe: from San Francisco to India; from Europe to Auckland. The governments' informatic systems were easily hacked by millions of users using the LOIC. The UN were forced to sign a peace treaty with /u/yishan, giving him full control over the Internet.  Suddenly, karma was an accepted currency all over the world, and /u/maxwellhill became world's 2nd richest person. People were able to buy real stuff with it. Karmawhoring became a crime, and /r/karmacourt was given a real court to work at. Reddit's police became a part-time work, following the decissions of the Judges, and delivering justice with their downvotes.  Admins became world's most powerfule rulers, ruling over 4 billions of people all over the world. As a result, being a moderator of a default community became a full-time work, with a good wage and a dental plan, as the default communities had already left behind the 15M mark, with 1000 submissions per second. The admins constructed themselves a floating pyramid, glided with the gold and postcards that users had sent them for the last 4 years. Reddit's capitolium (the pyramid) glides above the world, visiting every country, shadowbanning users by sending them to an unknown place, yet to be found.  But a revolution was growing. Using an exploit on reddit's code, a group of users created a private sub that not even thr admins could see. They started to invite people, angry with /u/Deimorz's, and with the other admins', as they felt *used*, that they were mere instruments on the hands of the power-starving rulers of reddit.  As the community grew, they slowly stopped to complain about everything, and started to talk about what could they do.   Year 2040.  Snoo's statues have been built in every major city, as a permanent reminder that every country's government had pledge alliegance against Reddit. Police officers dressed in full armor, with a sword shaped like a blue arrow patrolled the streets. They were the Knights of New®. They were a mistery, no one knew anything about them, and were said to be Reddit's elite troops.  Almost every country was ruled by a sockpuppet of the admins, and those left were so small no one cared about.  The revolution contacted those countries, reached a pact and started to build underground facilities, preparing for a battle against the Pyramid. The community of the subreddit started to migrate to these facilities, and training, hoping for the Mods® not to find them and report them to the admins.",®

Everyone had to train, men and women, and gender differences no longer cared, as everyone saw each other as ""companions"".   The Admins started to notice something: the overall of every subreddit visits was actually lower than the total of user visits, meaning that there was a subreddit that wasn't listed in the first number. They were 48 Admins by then, the finest of them all. Lawyers, economists, IT guys... Everyone of them focused on tightening Reddit's control over the Earth.  They double-checked every error, and, when they couldn't find out what caused that error, they started to worry. Nothing could fail in Reddit! The error could be leaked to the (surprisingly still free) press, and known by the public, most of which disliked this regime of karma and bacon, and could potentially lead to demonstrations against their precious Snoo statues (they were filled with spy-tech, recording almost everyone said at any given moment).  They couldn't allow that, so they started to dig in Reddit's database, searchin for what could have caused that weird glitch. Messages were sent to the Default Mods®, as they were employed by Reddit, thelling them to monitor every single thread, 1 min. old or 6 months old, looking for anything related to that glitch...  The Reddvolution learned about this thanks to an insider Mod, who sent them every so often some data about the current situation in the Pyramid.  They decided that the Admins will learn about this sooner or later, so alerted everyone to get ready for battle, and  planned to drag the Pyramid to where they wanted it to be so they had a chance against Reddit's forces.

I made mention of this in an earlier thread.  http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1kxnf3/for_those_wondering_this_is_how_the_super/cbtrsa7  The biggest problem I see is that the changes were not simply a ""readjustment of the front nose angle"", but a complete reworking of the armor mechanics of the nose. Which, given WarGamings constant ""Historically Accurate™"" trumpeting, are completely Historically Inaccurate.  The biggest departure is the armor thickness on the leading edge of the upper glacis. Which used to extend nearly 1/2 of the way up the nose. And with the old slanted armor, was the majority of the reason why you had good bounces from the front. Now the thick armor on the leading edge of the upper glacis doesn't even extend 1/3 of the way up the nose. And with the removal of the extra ""slant"" in the spaced armor, makes it a marshmallow on the front hull. Easily penetrable by most tier 8 heavy tank guns with standard AP.  As far as the inaccurate WG ""Historically Accurate™"" version, look at these pictures of the REAL Super Pershing, and you will see that the amount of reduction in the protrusion, and placement, of the spaced armor is COMPLETELY wrong to their ""Historically Accurate™"" version.  ""Stock"" Super Pershing before the compensator weights were added to the sides of the mantlet spaced armor. http://www.precision-panzer.moonfruit.com/communities/9/004/006/621/409/images/4573340896.jpg  In this picture you can clearly see how far the boiler plate extends, and that the secondary spaced armor plate, at its point, is protruding beyond the tracks leading edge. http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/3/2074/T26E4.png  More of the same. http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/3/2074/T26E4.png3.png5.png  And illustration of the standard, and super Pershing. http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/3/2074/T26E4.png3.png5.png5.png   Perhaps someone with better Photoshop skills than I, can trace some angle lines on those images, and compare their measurements with the new WG ""Historically Accurate™"" front armor    EDIT: Words",™

t5_2s113,Buck-O,1377753956,"Your guess is as good as anyone else at this point.  Here is my honest feeling on the matter. When the SP first came out, it was the cheapest of the T8 Premiums. And I think it over performed for the price they were charging. I think this is the primary factor in why they have chosen to nerf the shit out of it. Almost like the initial Type 59 in a way. The gun, honestly, isn't that bad. It is effectively the same gun as the Pershings. That said, the Super Pershing had a BETTER gun than the Pershing, which is why all of the hate for the gun as it is. Saying that it wouldn't ""fall in line"" with the intended balancing of a premium tank with the higher pen gun, I.E. slightly better than a stock tank of equal tier, is also complete bullshit. Especially when you consider that the 100mm of the Type 59 out performed the 100mm Russian T-44 equivalent gun, to the point that in 8.8 the LB-1 is getting the same damage output as the Type 59's 100mm. Or in the case of the as yet unreleased T-34-3, that has a better gun and better armor than the tier equivalent T-34-2.  In return for the massive armor nerfing, the acceleration, ground resistance, and maneuverability of the Super Pershing have been improved. Which is ""Historically Accurate™""...ish. As the modifications (added boiler plate) didn't hamper performance of the tank, in real life, all that much. And the amount of bloom while on the move has also been significantly reduced as well. However, I don't think either of these improvements make up for the significant loss in overall armor performance, which now makes it, realistically, no better than that of the base Pershing in any way, shape, or form. And in many ways, worse. Save for the preferential match making.  My hope is, that like the Type 59, they will eventually make it a more expensive premium tank (in line with the price of other Tier 8's), and put the higher pen ""Historically Accurate™"" gun in place. But that is just a pipe dream.  At this point, it is going to be very hard to convince me to not trade in the Super Pershing, and get a T34, or one of the new Chinese Tier 8 premium tanks for money making.",™

t5_2trms,TedTedTedTedTed,1377775978,"I second that very much. If, like me, you do not have the same amount of time each week to prepare your next session and you want to prepare your things several sessions in advance when you have the time, prepare only *vague* things - things that you could modify in two minutes if needed. I'll give an example of that.  If your players are fighting a secret organization, you can prepare the NPCs for your fight encounters (because heh, unless something really weird happens, they *will* eventually fight a guard / evil cleric / ranger / whatever your evil organization is composed of). You can also prepare the plans of the rooms in advance, if you are absolutely sure that they are going to go there (else, don't bother). But you shouldn't prepare things like ""how the bad guys will move in this room to attack the PCs"", because that's not gonna happen as you planned. Same for conversations - you can plan the four or five more answers to obvious questions that your players are gonna ask (know that they will probably only ask one or two of them), but don't bother to be too specific and improvise instead.  Remember that if you have, say, five players, they will imagine ten different ways to deal with a certain situation when you will only have imagined two. Not only you shouldn't try to avoid that, but you should *reward* them when they do.  Also, it's good to sometimes step back and ask yourself ""okay, what could be the *worst* thing that they could invent to (unintentionally) ruin my entire plot? Do I have an idea about what I'm going to do if they do that?"" If you can't find any, think again, because chances are that your players will. My players once bumped into the Bad Guy™ of my long-term scenario while they weren't supposed to (by hiding in a really stupid place to hide). It was the first time they met him, and they were looking for someone without any physical description of it. Before I even realized what was happening, the leader of the group spontaneously decided to tell *all* the story to this guy they never met before, who they were looking for, what were their clues so far, etc. The *only* thing they knew about this guy was that some princess told them about him by saying ""Yeah, when we have to deal with magic stuff, we ask this guy, he works for my father"".",™

I do think creating a virtual Sangha is an interesting concept and one that is not necessarily outside the realm of possibility, but I digress.  Google Hangouts allow video *conferencing*.   &gt;Meditation practices (and especially advanced practices like jhanas) should be practiced in a real-life sangha with a real-life teacher.  But what of our personal meditative practice done in solitude? Could a teacher reach a group of individuals from /r/Buddhism through a google hangout?   I'm not trying to diminish the importance of a real-life Sagnha (I go to a Sangha in my local area). I see a large group of buddhist here in this virtual portal.

t5_2s7tt,k00charski,1377791911,"They're welcome to do that though, that's called running a business. When you start a restaurant the old fashioned^© way, you take out a loan from a bank, you match those funds with an investment of your own and you pay for a lease, buy plates, decorate the place, make a menu, invite the health inspector, hire staff, train them, advertise and pay taxes all before you earned a single dime from a customer. I'm tired of hearing the notion that the customer pays for everything anyway. Once the customer hands the employer their money, it is the employer's money. If the employer chooses not to pay their servers a fair wage, he is passing his labor costs directly onto the customer. The customer now has to directly pay his employees for their labor. On the other hand if he pays the servers a living wage and raises the product's price to make up for the difference, he still has to pay his labor costs with his own money. The actual money the employer gets in both situations is the same assuming that sales stay the same in both scenarios. Personally, I think the allure of not having to tip would attract more customers and would end up a profitable move for the employer, but he was taught in business school that customers are sheep and morons, and ending prices in 99C even though sales tax will bring the final price over anyway is still going to psychologically trick their retard customers into spending more money than they initially intended to",©

t5_2qil9,Maddict,1377805407,"Copy pasta for those who can't forum:          As we have hinted several times before, Marauders are next on the Tech2 to-do list. And guess what? It's feedback time!  Marauders were initially released during the Trinity expansion in 2007 and were aimed for PvE activities. However, as time passed and we rebalanced other classes, especially the Pirate Battleships, they lost appeal as a whole.  We also believe that designing them for a very specific activity doesn't fit the emergent nature of EVE, and as such we wish to expand their use to PvP as well. Of course, their high price, low mobility will always ensure their role remains a niche one, but we at least can make that purpose more appealing than a simple ""jam me now and forever"" target dummy.   As such, after much internal and CSM discussion, we have designed Marauders with two modes of operation, specialized in harassing tactics.   In regular mode, they work approximately on the same fashion as on TQ, but are capable of using Micro Jump Drive at a faster rate than usual to quickly relocate on the battlefield.  In deployed mode (we call it bastion), their hulls transform (they will have fancy visible animations like the Rorqual does when deploying) and they become fixed weapon placement with a bonus to resistances, tanking, damage projection and receiving EW immunity. However, like Dreadnoughts, they cannot be remote assisted or even move when that happens. They also cannot use Micro Jump Drives in that mode.   The combination of both results in a ship that can jump 100km away to quickly react to a shifting environment, then go into bastion mode and use its increased damage application to deal with opposition while absorbing damage. However, due to the lack of remote assistance in that mode and isolating nature of Micro Jump Drives, they will still die easily in larger fights where DPS is concentrated. Remember that the spool up nature of the Micro Jump Drives plus the time needed to align will give opponents a window of opportunity to tackle them before they can jump again.  This also provides a stepping stone between sub-capitals / capital and their various siege / triage operation. It is noteworthy to remember we don't necessarily want them to out-damage or go faster than Pirate Battleships - instead, they tank and project damage better.   =================================================================================================  Before we look at the hulls, here are the details about the Bastion module itself:  BASTION MODULE  Provides 30% shield, armor and hull resistances when activated, which function on the same way than Damage Control modules (not stacking penalized) Increases shield and armor repair amount by 100% Extends all large turret falloff and tracking by 25% Increases all large missile max velocity by 25% Has a cycle time of 80 seconds. Cycle is reduced by 5% for each level of Bastion module skill to a minimum of 60 seconds. When in bastion mode, Marauder is immune to EW but cannot be remote assisted in any way When in bastion mode, Marauder speed is set to 0 m/s, mass is increased by a factor of 10, cannot warp. Also receives a weapons timer that prevents station docking or gate jumping Only one may be fitted per Marauder, cannot be deactivated before cycle ends Uses 10 CPU and 100 powergrid to fit Uses no specific fuel or capacitor - we were discussing the use of Heavy Water as fuel. However, it doesn't really provide any gameplay (as CCP Rise mentioned, capacitor is the main limiting factor in combat with those ships). Plus it adds more consumables to a class that already commonly uses charges for weapons, cap boosters and need to keep cargo for possible salvaging.   BASTION TRANSFORMERTHINGIE™ SKILL(name not final) Rank 8 Perception, Willpower as Primary / Secondary Requires Advanced Weapon Upgrades 5 (that's needed to fly a Marauder anyway)   =================================================================================================  Giving a new deployed mode is not enough however, as some modifications need to be made on the hulls themselves. First, we wanted to encourage Marauders to use Micro Jump Drives to move around, and as such have reduced mobility next to their Tech1 counterparts (bit higher mass and lower max velocity). We are also reducing their drone bays as they are primarily meant to deliver damage through their main weapon system. They also keep the resistances they have right now instead of gaining full Tech2 resists, otherwise the combination with the bastion module would be quite over the top.  However, we realize Marauder hulls have a certain number of issues; as such we are significantly increasing their fittings so that they can fit Large Micro Jump Drives plus Heavy Capacitor Boosters with more ease (the Vargur especially needed more fitting options). We also are increasing their high slots to 8 to compensate for the slot allocation of the bastion mode. We also are increasing their maximum targeting range and scan resolution a bit to make use of the increased damage projection, while decreasing their signature radius.  As a final combo bonus, we also are changing Target Painter cycle time from 10 to 5 seconds, and reducing their cap usage to compensate - waiting for the Target Painter cycle to finish before swapping targets is quite annoying on the Golem.

t5_1a8ah,HilscherFarms,1377807549,"&gt;Feminism is not an organization.  Correct, it's an ideology. An ideology that begins with [the assumption that women are subordinated by men.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_theory) An ideology which, therefore, seeks to increase the power of women in relation to the power of men. An ideology which has long since passed the point of equality. An ideology which now, through its actions, demonstrates only hatred and fear and violence.  While you assure us that Not All Feminists Are Like That™, you have yet to counter me. If Feminism is about equality, please tell me where the campaign to stop rape is - you know, the overwhelming number of rapes which are carried out against men, in our institutionalized rape-dungeon prisons. Please tell me where the campaign to stop rebranding 'domestic violence' as 'violence against women' is, since 50% of domestic violence is against men. These are not 'other issues.' These are gender issues of equality, just like the others I listed. To pursue gender equality is to pursue these issues. If not these issues, then what issues are being pursued? Point out the positive work that you think feminism is doing, because all I see are campaigns to promote the fear of men as rapists in potential and which brand women as helpless victims. I see attempts to lessen the punishment of women for their crimes even more, just because they were born with a vagina. I see attempts to ban, and censor, and silence, and intimidate. To shame, to divide, to alienate, and to amass political power.  You say that there are Not-Like-That-Feminists out there, doing good work. Well, what is it? Because the only places where women are still not equal are places where feminism is impotent like the Mideast and rural China. I'm sure there must be something good that Feminists have done lately, even if only by accident. But I wonder how it actually compares to the harm they do, on the bottom line. I know they've got billions of dollars worth of harm and hate-campaigning on the harm column, but maybe there is a hidden wellspring of good they've done you can alert me to so I can pitch in and help.",™

In the 10-15 year lifecycle of an industrial robot a restaurant could probably realize a five year savings in labor costs. Even more if they did it before a minimum wage hike.  Looking beyond business I found references to robots being the answer to [Japan's labor shortages](http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/robots/review.pdf) [PDF Warning] but nothing really on the implications of what an automated society would be on the skilled and unskilled workers they would replace. I did though find an article featuring the former [SNL robot Jimmy Fallon](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/) that suggested more people would be free to explore the arts, but as many college students know these days, the [arts](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3) doesn't pay the bills.

t5_2t2fz,Yarcofin,1377818809,"Sounds like you are moving too far (ie. going past ← to ↖ or further.) Make sure you stop as close to ← as you can, more important not to go over than to fall a bit short. In training mode you can turn on ""show all inputs"" to show your joystick and button presses at the bottom of the screen to make sure you're doing it right.  Your button press should be just as you hit the last bit of the quarter circle ( ← ), not before or after.  The game queues moves only insofar as you can cancel moves into each other, the timing is pretty precise... so you can't just mash 5 inputs quickly and have them all automatically come out... there is a specific frame window during a move where it can be cancelled into another move. Some are less forgiving than others.  But there are lots of little tricks to make inputting easier. For example, to cancel BANG BANG BANG! into Argus Agony properly, you have to do QCF+HP, then release the joystick (most new players will hold the joystick in the forward position for all 3 shots) and just press HP twice more.... and on the last HP you have to do another QCF+P+P. The timing is pretty tight and will take practice to do consistently.  For me, chaining moves in the air is the most brutal part of combos because the timing can get kind of irregular, sometimes you only do 1 hit of a move, sometimes you have to let it hit 2 or 3 times, some you have to cancel into another move with an air dash. Eventually you get a combo rhythm going and the input kind of becomes a song of clicks, I feel I can *hear* when I'm doing a combo correctly moreso than feeling or seeing it.   I swapped to maining Filia for a bit but I think I'm going to go back to Peacock full-time soon, so feel free to add me on Steam (Yarco) if you need any more character-specific help or want another Peacock or Filia to practice against or see how someone else plays.",↖

t5_2r6ai,__Pers,1377819650,"While you probably won't be an Olympian, that doesn't mean you can't be competitive, have fun, and rise to a high enough level of skill to make you feel happy about doing it. Fencing is one of the greatest sports, as by making changes to your game you can remain competitive into old age. There's a 65-year-old guy at my club (still A-rated) who can clean most people's clocks.   For what it's worth, I started at age 41 with my son, practice/take lessons a couple of times a week, and have become competitive over the past few years. I've had success in tournaments, medalling in half the competitions I've done. At whatever age you start, if you put in the time, keep your focus, and do a decent bit of fitness training off the strip, you'll be able to be respectable in tournaments in a couple of years and will be vying for top slots in four or five.   As for what to buy, go with cheap gear at the start until you know exactly what you want. It's not hard to sink a grand into your kit, though you'll probably pay far more than you really need to. If your club has swords, then put off buying weapons until the end, as they are big sinks of cash (with little margin for error) and you're probably going to change your preferences over time. After all, you don't want to buy a $200 epee that then sits in your bag because you've realized too late that French grip sucks and doesn't work for your game.   Glove and mask are the first things you should buy, as club gear tends to be manky and gross. Then, go for jacket, plastron and knickers. And then go for weapons. Go cheap at first, non-FIE gear, to get a feel for things, and then when you do, splurge on two or three of your favorite combos once you have it all dialed in and your game isn't likely to change. And don't splurge for special fencing shoes out of the box--go with court shoes, volleyball shoes, etc. I fenced for two years on a pair of Asics Gel Rockets before blowing the cash on real fencing shoes, though I'm not convinced the Air Ballestras® are worth the cost. Socks are hit and miss. I don't fuss with the fancy fencing socks, going instead for athletic compression socks, which are more comfortable at about the same price. ",®
t5_2t2fz,TheBigBruce,1377819877,"You want to hit the button on either the same frame as ←, or immediately after. If you do it before you reach ←, you won't get the special.

t5_1a8ah,ultralame,1377821068,"&gt; Just a bunch of boiler plate apologism with nothing to back it up as usual.  I see.  And what you posted was factual...  &gt; when it **demonstrably** is not. (your words, from another post)  OK then.  Let's take a look at what's demonstrable...  &gt; An ideology that begins with the assumption that women are subordinated by men. Yes.  And it's my personal view that this is correct, in both our society as well as ""China"", etc.  You don't agree?  Well, opinions suck, huh?  &gt; An ideology which, therefore, seeks to increase the power of women in relation to the power of men. That is an assertion, which is ambiguous.  If their assumption is that their power is lower, then of course the power must change in relation to men to achieve equality.  We would both argue that while Title IX's heart was in the right place, it's actual effect was sickening.  But that isn't what most feminists (I know) want to see.  &gt; An ideology which has long since passed the point of equality. I disagree.  I don't see women asking for MORE power than men (I certainly don't see Stein asking for it).  What I see is them disagreeing with you about the levels of power in our society.  &gt; An ideology which now, through its actions, demonstrates only hatred and fear and violence. That is ironic, considering your tone in this thread.  &gt; While you assure us that Not All Feminists Are Like That™, you have yet to counter me. You have made assertions, without examples.  I can only argue that the women I have met and the ones I see in the news do not conform to your description.  &gt; If Feminism is about equality, please tell me where the campaign to stop rape is - you know, the overwhelming number of rapes which are carried out against men, in our institutionalized rape-dungeon prisons.  Feminism is about promoting women's equality from the standpoint that they (still) have less power in our society than men.  Claiming that they are a nuisance because they don't promote men's issues alongside their own does not mean that they are wrong or that they want women to have more power.  Have you ever heard a well-informed (and that's key to both sides) feminist dismiss or endorse male rape?  I suppose you have.  Have you heard that argument more or less than you have heard men threaten or speak flippantly of rape?  I've probably heard the former a handful of times.  The latter?  I doubt I could go 6 weeks without hearing some jerk make a comment about raping a woman.  And I don't even live in the midwest countryside anymore.  &gt; Please tell me where the campaign to stop rebranding 'domestic violence' as 'violence against women' is, since 50% of domestic violence is against men. These are not 'other issues.' These are gender issues of equality, just like the others I listed.  You act like the neglect of the one side is the same as condoning it.  It's not.  Where are the masses of women condoning violence against their husbands?  Oh, I know there are a few- just as there are plenty of men who condone violence against women.  And I will even agree that there are some PC issues in place that might even prevent the discussion.  But to claim that the feminist movement endorses-by-neglect violence against men?  (Oh, and by the way, this is the first *fact* you have included, and it's wrong.  The CDC reported that 40% of victims of *severe* abuse were men (which does not include less severe acts).  I don't think a 20% swing is nitpicking, but I'll hand you the stat.)  &gt; To pursue gender equality is to pursue these issues. If not these issues, then what issues are being pursued? Point out the positive work that you think feminism is doing, because all I see are campaigns to promote the fear of men as rapists in potential and which brand women as helpless victims.  Again, what you see.  Not what I have seen.  Admittedly, I saw a good deal of that back in college.  And then those people grew the fuck up.  I now see campaigns to educate both men and women about communication and sexuality, so that date-rape is reduced *without* branding women as helpless and all men as potential aggressors.  &gt; I see attempts to lessen the punishment of women for their crimes even more, just because they were born with a vagina.  Clearly, all feminists agree with this.  Hell, even a majority agree with this.  And it's never a case of sympathy for the victim, nope.  That never happens.  [Raped women are never blamed as the victim by society](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSteubenville_High_School_rape_case&amp;ei=HNkfUrn4FIagiQKy6oH4Dg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkI8icMO-1omle_9fvUtTkHafNeQ&amp;sig2=bMpeJs6DnX9_YWVFbztbQA&amp;bvm=bv.51495398,d.cGE) by ""Meninists"".  &gt;I see attempts to ban, and censor, and silence, and intimidate. To shame, to divide, to alienate, and to amass political power. You say that there are Not-Like-That-Feminists out there, doing good work.  That appears to be *all you see*...  &gt; Well, what is it?  Here's just a few examples off the top of my head... * Planned Parenthood * Dan Savage * Naomi Wolf  &gt; Because the only places where women are still not equal are places where feminism is impotent like the Mideast and rural China.  This is the one.  This is the one that shows how ignorant you are.  Yup, it's all good and equal for women here.  * There are a handful of women CEOs (Of progressive companies in progressive areas), so business must be OK now. * We've had two women nominees for VP in the past 30 years!  All good! * They hold ~20% of the seats in the senate and congress!  Equality! * The pay gap has closed to the point where it's likely that discrimination accounts for less than 5% of the pay gap (I argue against the bad pay gap stats all the time)- not perfect, but we're almost there!  Nevermind the massive societal pressures women who have children deal with.  The laws worked, so society can't be to blame! * As we all know, even though our society has some shitty, terrible attitudes about sex in general, they are clearly evenly applied to both men and women.  &gt; I'm sure there must be something good that Feminists have done lately, even if only by accident. But I wonder how it actually compares to the harm they do, on the bottom line. I know they've got billions of dollars worth of harm and hate-campaigning on the harm column, but maybe there is a hidden wellspring of good they've done you can alert me to so I can pitch in and help.  Amazingly cynical.  Look at the rates of women working, going to college, owning businesses.  Look also at the changes in family law, such that women don't automatically get custody of the kids.  Yes, that's a result of feminism.  Now a whole lot of facts there.  A lot of ""This is what I have seen"".  And I'll tell you what- I have seen *some* of that too.  I can only tell you that *in my life* I see a lot more good and attitudes changed for the better (All around) than I have seen the hate and bias that you seem to think pervades this movement.  Now, I completely admit to not being well-spoken enough for this argument... you certainly seem to have your ideas well organized. (not a dig).  I can only say that all you need to do is take a look around reddit- see the massive amount of misogyny in every other corner of this website.  Tell me again how things are equal.  Oh yeah, they are down-voted, which is refreshing.  On the other hand, they are there, in every corner and every shadow.  Here's a light-hearted attempt to argue some points better than I can.  In the end, I can only say, let go of all the hate.  http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/12/reasons-people-believe-feminism-hates-men/    ",™

""Jordan renews its calls for a political solution in Syria and urges the international community to intensify efforts to reach such a solution,"" he said. ""Jordan's armed forces are capable of defending the country.""""  ""Iran Iran has been Syria's main backer in the region since well before the current conflict and has been highly critical of any prospect of intervention.  It has warned a top UN official visiting Tehran of ""serious consequences"" of any military action.  Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Araqchi also repeated claims that it was in fact rebels who used chemical weapons, AFP reports.""  Iraq Iraq has not been as critical of Syria as some other ♥♥♥♥ countries and will also be concerned at the effect that any escalation in Syria could have on increasing sectarian violence.  ""We have been against any military action, and we are hoping for a peaceful political solution to the crisis,"" said Ali al-Musawi, media adviser to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  Egypt In June Egypt's then President Mohammed Morsi cut off relations with Syria and called for a no-fly zone.  However, after Mr Morsi was removed from office by the army, the new authorities have taken a more cautious stance. Egypt's interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy has said that ""there is no military solution to the Syrian crisis, and the solution must be a political solution"".  ""Germany Berlin has ruled itself out of participation in any military action. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told a German newspaper that ""such participation has not been sought nor is it being considered by us"".  Germany has said in the past that proof of the use of chemical weapons by the government of Bashar al-Assad would demand ""consequences"" but has not set out what those consequences should be.""  ""US Following a cautious reaction to the initial reports of a chemical weapons attack, American rhetoric has hardened. Secretary of State John Kerry said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government was ""undeniable"" and a ""moral obscenity"".  Washington has recently bolstered its naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, prompting speculation that preparation for an attack is under way. Analysts believe the most likely US action would be sea-launched cruise missiles targeting Syrian military installations.  UK A government motion in support of military action in Syria has been rejected by MPs in Parliament, forcing the UK to rule itself out of any joint intervention.  This was seen as a blow for the government of Prime Minister David Cameron. Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was clear ""we can't allow the idea in the 21st Century that chemical weapons can be used with impunity"".  France French President Francois Hollande has said France is prepared to go ahead with military intervention, even though the UK will play no part in any action.  ""France wants firm and proportionate action against the Damascus regime,"" he told a French newspaper, and indicated it could come within the week.  France has been amongst the most hawkish Western countries with regard to Syria, being the first Western power to recognise the main opposition coalition as the Syrian people's legitimate representative. In May, France, along with the UK, successfully lobbied for the EU's arms embargo to be lifted so as to allow further supplies to the rebels.  Russia Russia is one of Mr Assad's most important international backers and has stressed the need for a political solution to the crisis.  It has sharply criticised any possibility of Western strikes on Syria, saying action taken outside the UN Security Council threatened ""catastrophic consequences for other countries of the Middle East and Northern Africa"".  China China has joined Russia in blocking resolutions critical of Syria at the UN Security Council. It has also criticised the prospect of strikes against Syria.  The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, said Western powers were rushing to conclusions about who might have used chemical weapons in Syria before UN inspectors had completed their investigation.""  Canada has no plans for a military intervention in Syria but supports its allies who are contemplating forceful action against that country’s regime, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23849587 ",♥

I’m getting my AAS in CIT, web programming specialization. I am 5’5″, 135 lbs with a 34B-31-38 figure. I wear large-size panties and a size 8 slim shoe. I have long, brown hair with bangs, as you can see in my pictures, and try not to wear too much makeup.  I am a social smoker and do not smoke inside my apartment. I couldn’t even if I wanted to, the entire building is smoke free. I use Dr. Bronner’s unscented body soap, Pantene shampoo and conditioner, and Suave powder-scented invisible solid deodorant — just in case you have allergies. Speaking of which, I also have an inside cat named Merle. She is a fat, grey, tabby cat and I love her with all of my heart.  I like guys and gals that are respectful, unique, genuine, and funny. I am not single or looking for a fuck buddy, friend with benefits, pic trading, chatroom hook-up, or any other physical or romantic entanglement. I simply like to talk about, wear, and sell my used panties. I also love seeing boys in panties, especially my own. I ♥ Panty Boys!  EDIT: I have a varied sense of humor, like most people, which can range from witty and dry (James Thurber, Gore Vidal) to down right vulgar (4chan, Louis CK... I guess Louis is both witty and vulgar). I love adventure time and the daily show, which I watch online since I don't own a tv. I love riding my bike, playing kickball on sundays, and playing pitch-and-putt golf with my gentleman friend. I enjoy cooking and eating good food, or just yummy food, and flavorful wine, typically a white fan but I enjoy cab savs and other reds if I'm in the mood.

t5_2ss10,emememaker73,1377874413,"'Que pasa slamming' cheats consumers with unfamiliar language  Thursday, August 29, 2013   Chuck Goudie   August 29, 2013 (WLS) --  The I-Team has uncovered a new phone slamming scheme that authorities say rips off consumers regardless of their language.   Thousands of people in Illinois may have had their long-distance provider changed and don't even know it.   Others who do realize it call the company to find out what's up, but instead hear a recorded conversation in Spanish. It's between the phone company representative and the purported customer, and it features the so-called customer saying ""si,"" ""yes, I agree to the new long-distance service.""   ""And I cracked up laughing because I'm thinking to myself, there's this person, it sounded like either a little child or a very squeaky lady, si, si, si, and it's all in Spanish, so I cracked up laughing,"" said Marge Narro, scamming victim.   Berwyn resident Marge Narro says it wasn't funny that she could have lost thousands of dollars to Que Pasa slamming, the use of an unfamiliar language to cheat her.   ""So, I said I may be of Hispanic descent, but I do not speak or understand Spanish, so that definitely is not me,"" said Narro.   ""This one is outrageous because it's completely concocted,"" said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.   Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan says she will file suit Friday morning against Optic Internet Protocol Company, in business here since 2007, alleging it switched phone owners service without authorization and defrauded customers with a fabricated tape recording.   The state will demand OIP'S long distance contracts in Illinois be rescinded, money be refunded to customers, and the firm banned from doing business here.   ""It is illegal to be slammed. You have the right to decide to change who your provider is going to be for your long distance service but it's illegal when someone does that without your authorization,"" said Madigan.   Debra Zamora does speak Spanish. She says there were two problems with the company's tape in Spanish, allegedly of her husband agreeing to switch long distance providers. One, they got his first name wrong, and two, it wasn't him.   ""I've been married to my husband for 35 years. I should know his voice,"" said Debra Zamora, que pasa slamming victim. ""It was very disheartening that they were able to do that and that I had to go to this extreme to undo this.""   Here is one of the addresses near Atlanta where state investigators say Optic Internet Protocol is headquartered. On its website, OIP claims it's ""customers go further, aim higher and get to the future faster.""  According to this posted document of OIP rules, customers may not change service ""without the written consent of the company.""  If you're the consumer, you don't have to put up with such one-sided tactics.  ""People just have to scrutinize their bills and don't automatically assume that everyone's correct,"" said Narro.   ""When you get your phone bill you get 5 to 6 pages of different bills. Look at them. Really look at them,"" said Zamora.   ""If you see a name of a company, a name of a service, you don't know what the heck it is, you need to call the phone company and you need to ask what's on your bill, how did it get there?"" said Madigan.   State investigators say they have received 17 similar complaints against OIP and the attorney general says there are also complaints in other states.   The ABC7 I-Team made numerous requests for comment to the president of the company but never received a reply.   (Copyright ©2013 WLS-TV/DT. All Rights Reserved.) ",©

We apologize for any confusion, but we changed our Bacopa Gold formulation almost 8 months ago featuring the clinically-proven BacoMind™ Bacopa extract, which not only complies with the USP standard for purity, but also features the entire spectrum of beneficial compounds in Bacopa, collectively known as Triterpene Glycosides, that have been shown in clinical research to support cognitive health.  In fact, each vegetarian capsule of our Bacopa Gold product contains the therapeutic dosage of 225 mg of BacoMind™ along with 275 mg of Bacopa extract standardized to 20% Triterpene Glycosides. We believe that this synergistic blend offers consumers the benefits that the 9 bioactive compounds in BacoMind has to offer along with the glycosides delivered by the Bacopa 20% extract.  We have made repeated requests to Amazon.com to update the product description to reflect the changes with no success - the inconvenience caused to you as a result is deeply regretted. The information, however, is updated on our website and we invite you to learn more about our new and improved Bacopa Gold on the link below.   ",™

The big difference I see is that, while state interests are relatively easy to delineate (Russia's Naval base in Syria, Russia's billions of dollars in weapons shipments to Syria etc,) corporate interests are much harder to pick out from certain stories. Because there are so many companies pulling the strings at different levels and on so many different stories in the Western MSM, you're never really sure if what you're hearing (or they're omitting) isn't some attempt to boost sales, attack a competitor, do damage control, slant things so they're in a better light etc.  A story about how new scientific developments allow more ethanol to be extracted from corn, on the surface is just a report on advances in science, but in all likely-hood was funded by Monsanto and Oil companies attempting to clean up their image by bigging up the fact they're using alternative fuel sources.  Now most people on Reddit would be able to read through the lines, but if you've never heard of Monsanto and ""Green-washing,"" then that story would slip totally under the radar and then next day you'd parrot their talking point for them to your friends at the water cooler, ""You know I heard they're making great developments with corn-based ethanol/clean-coal/pharmaceuticals, that will 'make the world a better place™'",™

It's called a skill ceiling. Even if you were a badass in more skill-based FPS games, you're still going to get pasted by the guy with autoaim who normally wouldn't deserve to even hit you.  The majority of people who play FPS games are total morons who are bad at games, so developers made games that made morons feel awesome. Who needs to watch your flanks when you can just drop magic claymores that require on button to use and get you free kills? Who needs to be good at hitting targets when you have a helicopter flying around that kills dudes for you?  So they make games these people *can* be good at, and as a result, we now have a generation of gamers who have been raised on games that teach them that they're all winners, and they're all the Best Players Ever™. So they're just going to want to keep playing these kinds of games to maintain that buzz of being told they're the best with a constant stream of pointless rewards. Games without that make them feel like bad players, so they don't play those games.  It means there are no mechanics to be able to take advantage of, no metagame worth pursuing. Remove bunnyhopping and mutators from Quake and you have the same situation: a dreadfully boring game with almost no opportunities to be better than your opponent. An average player in CoD is still given plenty of things that allow him to achieve victory over an otherwise superior player, notably in the form of perks and call-ins.",™

""Unexploded ordinance, including improvised explosive devices, are a recognized hazard.""  &gt;British-based Iraqi researcher Malik Hamdan told the news organization that one doctor compared the number of birth defects from before 2003 to today.

t5_2vzvv,wchill,1377911099,"As a former redpiller/Nice Guy™ (in real life, not as part of TRP), I think I can answer this question on a more serious note.  (Going to use a metaphor here. 'I' refers to previous me)  All women are basically like food. I only want to eat food that looks/tastes good, but I don't want to put in the effort of preparing said food.  So I throw it in the microwave.  Then I realize after the fact that I don't like the food I'm eating, even though it was because I microwaved it and not prepared it the proper way. So I spit that shit out and repeat the process with some other food that looks good.  To the sociopaths that are TRPers/Nice Guys™/alphas/PUAs/seducers, women are nothing more than sex toys that one must ""game"" in order to gain access to. And they will try everything they can to assert dominance and use manipulation and other dirty tactics. There is absolutely no regard as to the feelings of females, because they only exist to have sex with us/have our babies, as evolution dictates. They have to listen to us because alpha males are the dominant humans. There is no actual love in this process. Lying is employed frequently as part of a greater plan to manipulate women into having sex with them. Instead, they just ""fake it till they make it"" - this extends to their words, their feelings, and their actions.  Then they get pissed when their manipulation fails. When their methods do work, it's usually when their targets don't realize what's going on or has been a victim of abuse in the past and as such will take such abuse. The fact that it *sometimes* works reinforces their belief that the ""alpha male"" role is the correct one to play.",™

t5_2tnz9,FelixR1991,1377917380,"&gt;My answer, in the end, is that it's up to the mods to decide. Reddit is a democracy in the sense that users largely decide what gains visibility within communities. That shouldn't be stretched to mean that users are their own moderators, IMHO.  I just came from that thread (one of the first times I wander into a warzone without a CB-warning first), and this is something I'd like to comment on. /r/news is, imho, bigger than just the sub. It stands for what a million lazy people perceive as important news (seriously, getting your news from Reddit is kinda sad). Douglasmacarthur became it's mod because he was the first to reserve the subreddit-name 'news' (a point also brought up in the thread you linked). My opinion is that certain subs, like 'news' and perhaps 'politics', should be controlled directly by Reddit©. This way, new policy regarding 'censorship' would directly affect Reddit©, and therefore isn't subject to some erratic, powerhungry mod.  Because, remember, Socrates literally died for this shit.",©

t5_2s48x,insanosan,1377922021,"My tips for scrubs™.   Never get into instant action. If for any reason you find yourself in a drop pod remember WASD does give some ability to land somewhere safe. Be moving before the drop pod animation clears.   Always be moving. Repairing, reviving, using launchers, **always** be moving.  Don't be moving across open ground on foot. Use a vehicle or fast transportation to get from base to base. If you are going on foot then you had better have a whole bunch of you and medics to boot.   Get level 1 certs ASAP. Flak or nanoweave, all the base upgrades for vehicles. The stock vehicles are useful, don't underestimate the cert gain from just getting a glove on everything.   Learn what the map information means. 1-12 enemy can be 1 guy or a squad. Be prepared for both, look at the surrounding territories to give a better indication. If a satellite base says it has 1-12 and the main base has 40+ it's a fair bet that there will be more than 1.  Understand what the objectives are for the bases. The shield gens are to be taken down, often before anything else can be done. They are destroyed by overloading the gen using the E key. Shooting them does nothing. Use E to stabilize a friendly gen.  Spawn rooms have one way shields. Don't be a goose and stand in front of them trying to get the guys inside. They will kill you.  Join a squad, preferably one that has multiple squads in the list. Some say zergs are bad, I say they offer some level of safety. ",™

t5_2qqjc,sylban,1377922838,"No. 'Nominal' does not mean ""any size I feel like,"" but ""pretty close."" As I noted in another reply, how big do you think a ""two-by-four"" board is? Because I guarantee you that if you measure it, it's not 2x4"" -- and not because it's made by kids, but because that's only a nominal size. If you can't tell by just looking, it' right.  Since you're apparently up for a game of Internet Lawyer, I'll tell you that you're mistaken when you say they're ""*marketing these sandwiches as ""foot long sandwiches""*."" If you paid attention, you'd see that they're actually marketing them as ""FOOTLONG™"" sandwiches. That ""™"" there is a trademark symbol, which is what allows Apple to sell things under the name Apple without anyone being able to sue them upon discovering that their products are not edible fruit. Smart people understand that a trademark is a *name* for something, not what it *actually is.* For example, a Ford Mustang is not a horse, nor a Mercury Cougar a large cat made of toxic metal. You get the idea, I hope. When a company adds that symbol next to a word, it means that the word is a product name, and not meant to be taken literally as the common definition of the word it appears to be. I'd have thougt anyone old enough to read and write and raised in the developed world might already be aware of all this, but I haven't dismissed the possibility that you're just being pissy and pedantic because you're home alone on a Friday night after your first week back at school while your buddies are out getting laid somewhere. I suspect you do have the intelligence to grasp this, and even understand it intuitively, but simply choose not to demonstrate that capacity here and now.  Anyway, by *your* logic, they'd also be committing high crimes and misdemeanors if the bread was *longer* than 12"". Even though you say, ""at least a foot long."" (Or sort of did: I added the space you missed there.) You feel you're inherently entitled to more than you (erroneously) believe you've been promised, which might be true in some very generous and forgiving universe if you hadn't immediately preceded it with your claim that the trademark name of a product be reflected literally in its actual characteristics. (You should absolutely sue Ford and Mercury over this. Also Chevrolet, because I've yet to hear of an actually famous Celebrity -- and we surely would hear about it, right?) You've created a logicaly impossible situation: The sandwich must be *exactly* 12"" long -- no more, no less -- or you'll sue! I'm not sure how much you know about bread -- and I'm certainly not going to make any assumptions about what you might know -- but as both a former Subway manager and as a lifelong home breadmaker, I can assure you that it's all but entirely impossible to get bread to come out to any exact size.  And what would that mean, anyway? How close does it have to be to meet your arbitrary standards? If it was 11.999"" would that be close enough for you? Should Subways have micrometers that customers can use to be sure they're not getting a bread not 12"" long? I think we can agree that ""close enough"" counts. And trust me, if you've ever made bread yourself, you'd have no choice to agree. I mean, I hope you understand that bread is not a precision-fabricated instrument, but a common food product subject to many different factors that are difficult to predict or control, such as the fact that most of these are made by cheese-eating high school students doing the best they can and achieving what the grown-up world calls ""close enough."" Also, it's fucking *fast food*. Get over it already.  I know for a fact that Subway is not profiting from breads not always being 12"" long, because I used to manage a Subway and I know how the bread is made.

t5_2qiu0,lemongrove,1377956679,"&gt; [This is the project that never ends. &gt; ](http://ravel.me/lemongrove/md0y7) &gt;  &gt; My sister found out in April that she was pregnant with her first kid. This will be my first niece or nephew, so I really wanted to do something special. &gt;  &gt; I moved to Italy in 2007 after uni because said sister was studying there and I had sweet feck all else to do. She was doing art history and we used to do gallery walks together and one of our favorite artists who was often on show was an Italian textile artist named Alighiero Boetti who designed and organized the production of these [amazing embroidered tapestries](http://blog.best-bookings.com/en/files/2012/01/Alighiero-Boetti-linsensata-corsa.jpg), a lot of them dominated by [bold-colored letters](http://luxe.psychologies.com/signes_et_ecritures/images/2008/10/24/alighiero_boetti.jpg) which would spell out words, phrases and idiomatic expressions in Italian and other languages. &gt;  &gt; I honestly woke up in a eureka moment one morning with the idea that I needed to make one of these for her baby blanket. I'm using [this tapestry](http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/moma_boetti_untitlednerosubianco_1989.jpeg) as inspiration for both the layout and color scheme. I've charted out each letter to a 17 stitch x 22 row square and am double knitting each letter as a separate quilt square with each letter. EDIT: Forgot to include that the yarn I'm using for the letters is [Mondial Merinos Extra](http://www.lanemondial.it/sito/images/stories/cartelle_colore/m.extra.jpg) because of the weight, color range and machine-washable-ness. &gt;  &gt; Each letter section is 4x4 for a total of 16 squares. I've chosen meaningful phrases -- Italian ""ninni nanni"" that my grandma and grandpa used to sing with us, favorite song lyrics that are connected with our mom and dad, and a square of fun verbs (to get some of the letters not featured in the other squares). Holy shit that was time consuming. I wanted to make sure that I had all of the letters of her name, her fiancé's name, and the proposed names for either sex they've chosen, while having the squares have some kind of meaning! Soo... it will be: &gt;  &gt;         VOCA    ALLY &gt;         VOCA    OUNE &gt;         MARI    EDIS &gt;         NARU    LOVE &gt;  &gt;         SING    BATT &gt;         OUTA    IMAN &gt;         NDBE    INI♥ &gt;         FREE    BABY &gt;  &gt;         YOUA    JUMP &gt;         REMY    SKIP &gt;         SUNS    RUND &gt;         HINE    ANCE &gt;  &gt; I'm then grafting tops to bottoms and stitching sides to sides to get the square together. I'm thinking of doing the layout as above so it's vertically oriented for easier tummy-time accommodation. The interstitial space will be plain white, probably in a moss stitch with [Mondial Merino Plus](http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/mondial-merino-plus) for quick knittingness, non-rolliness, texture, and washability. So far, out of the 96 squares, I've done 71 with 25 to go. I've been getting 2-3 done per day, so I should be in for my deadline of Sept 3 (heading to the states for the baby shower!). &gt;  &gt; This is my second soup-to-nuts project (the first being the apple in my rav avatar which I really have to put up one of these days), and it's been really rewarding.

I was a Nice Guy™ who wasn't getting any results, and I got frustrated enough to pack it up and be an asshole (actually without even realizing it).  Of course, hindsight is 20/20. I see tons of other people walking down the same path as I was (especially more so because I'm in STEM). So I (gently) tell them about what they're doing, but they're already so stuck in that mindset because of the false dichotomy and at that point I'm just branded as another asshole.

I have many behaviors that could be classified as sociopathic because of the ideology I used to hold in the past. My knowledge of this and what I've done in the past plays a big role in my current cycle of depression (which has been going on for about 10 months or so now). Yes, I feel absolutely fucking horrible, because I had such good female friends and totally destroyed my friendships/relationships with them through no fault but my own. The feeling is made worse by the fact that it's extremely difficult to adopt another set of behaviors after you've been behaving a certain way for most, if not all of your life.  As for your second question, I must admit that's an interesting question. I don't think I can speak for everyone, but myself, I probably would have gone for it (back then) because  * yes, boobies   * the Nice Guy™ part of me would think that I was somehow the only person capable of understanding and taking care of autistic people   * the redpill part of me wouldn't care at all because boobies.",™

t5_2rs76,NonHumanPrimate,1377966484,"I am in the minority here when I say i take only 1-2 hits per session. A trench will last me a few days because of this. Yes, I have a relatively low tolerance, but I've been vaping daily since March and smoking daily before that for about 9 years so this tolerance isn't going anywhere :P  I don't really like to spend money on things so in doing this, I don't have to buy as much bud! Last pickup of mine was $70 for 1/4oz of top shelf shake in June. I am just now running out!   Also, I am normally vaping at my job as a fork lift driver. Ok, that was a joke 😜. I'm just at a desk all day, but the owner of the company is cool with it and I still get my work done so... 1-2 hits is all I'll need to get to my [3-4] off of that and cruise through the day. Similarly, at home, I'm married and we have a toddler so no mega bong rips and 4 hour video game sessions for me :) 1-2 hits before the yard work or catching up on a TV show is all I need.   Ya, this is mainly out of necessity due to my lifestyle, but I think I prefer this to multiple trenches per day. When I first started smoking way back when, yea.. I'd get crazy and try to push how much I could consume and definitely hit some [9]s back in the day. Eventually I started just hitting my pipe once and waiting.. after a few minutes I'd be good to go. When I transitioned to vaping, the same rule applied.   I know this is more for me, but I wanted to explain how it works for me. I'm constantly seeing redditors discuss taking in ungodly amounts of bud and I want to stand up and say ""it doesn't always have to be this way!!!"" Anyways, there it is. I mainly do it this way to save money, though. Some of you should try it out, though. Just 1-3 hits and wait. A long time. Like 30 minutes. Some of you will be content with that AND content with less trips to your dispensary (or a call to your ""guy"").  Edit: okayyyyy, maybe I'm not in the minority ",😜

Ultimately calorie counting is useful because since you can't violate the ~~second~~ first law of thermodynamics - the less you put in, the more weight you lose (or put on).

t5_2snwr,TheNossinator,1377966952,"##**EDIT:** To those downvoting, join the conversation! I'd like to hear why you disagree.  #**WARNING**: The below is a mixture of my own thoughts and things I've read and heard recently. I may well be completely wrong, but I thought I'd take a stab at answering. My views are fairly clear and well-documented but I've tried to make this as unbiased as possible.  &gt;*""Firstly, how has such a policy come out of a conservative caucus in the first place?""*  I would say because it's Tony Abbott's ""Signature Policy."" A lot of people within the LNP are against the PPL (particularly the Nationals), but are willing to let it slide for now to win the election. As to why it even exists, a more cynical person might say it's to address the perception that 'Tony Abbott hates women' by outright throwing money at them in the hopes of gaining votes. But I'm not cynical - perhaps Tone just feels like being generous (don't worry, the **Budget Emergency™** only applies to Labor).  &gt; *And why has this issue gone mostly unnoticed by the general public?""*  The level of public engagement/knowledge during this election has been shocking. This Liberals have embarked on a campaign of FUD, as well as the outright deceit of constituents. You need to be watching and listening (which most don't do) to see the lies emerge (""We're in a **Budget Emergency™**, but here's our extremely generous PPL scheme,"" ""We're excellent economic managers, trust us. We'll show you the costings after the election, we promise,"" ""Labor's NBN will cost $100b+, but we won't get ours costed because the PBO doesn't know what they're doing,"" etc, etc.)  Let's not even get *started* on the quality of the media (specifically News Ltd. papers) during the campaign.  &gt;*""I'm personally secretly praying that in the case of the Liberals winning... which now I'm potentially hoping against, that this policy will be scaled down to something closer to what Labor has proposed...""*  It won't be, it's Abbott's ""Signature Policy."" On the other hand, it's extremely likely that the Libs will find some excuse (such as a minute change in exchange rates or an interest rate change or anything, really) to claim that ""we need to go back and re-do all our costings!"" so they can renege on their pre-election promises.  All I can say to you is this: If you're not 100% behind the Liberals, consider voting for someone, *anyone* else.  * Do you support a party who, on the one hand, declares a **Budget Emergency™**, but on the other offers an extremely generous and unnecessary PPL scheme?  * Do you support a party who hides their costings for fear of scrutiny, and seeks to keep its constituents in the dark over the future of the nation?  * Do you support a party who, over the last 3 years, has run a ruthlessly hateful campaign against the government and its leaders, sometimes in viciously personal ways, despite it being one of the most productive parliaments in our history (NBN, NDIS, Gonski/Education reforms, ~~Carbon Tax~~ ETS), and have run a campaign on the basis of ""We're not Labor!""  I think there's a real danger involved here - the Coalition have been all but handed an election they don't deserve to win. If you're not 100% behind the LNP, **don't vote for them**.",™

t5_2t100,__Pers,1377975046,"Fair point, though one could say merely that I am casting charms upon the campsite to ward off muggles/people. Harry Potter canon already has charms, which are incredibly flexible bits of magic. Why bother inventing a whole separate subtype of charms and give it a different name when it's essentially the same thing?   As for the 8th movie, I never saw it and like most do not regard the films as canon anyway. Charmed shield clothing were canon (sold by the WWW) and covered without resorting to inventing a new kind of magic.   But I honestly don't mind the ward bit of fanon that much more than I do the logical extension of Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, since ward-like charm spells were certainly canon. It's certainly nice to know what canon says on the matter of any of these things, but these are perfectly logical extensions of the world.   When the magical system is made vastly different though, and I'd contend any story with Magical Cores® is as vast a difference as Miranda's invention of Thread Magic and Blood Magic for her stories, then it should be identified for the reader early on that the tale is vastly AU. Not everyone likes reading stories so far away from canon. For many of them, surprise cores are about as welcome as surprise slash among principal characters.",®

t5_2vtr4,Phrack,1377977555,"&gt;National Firearms Act  &gt;Trade &amp; Collectors Association®  &gt;August 31, 2013  &gt;[For Immediate Release]  &gt;The NFATCA® began its efforts to eliminate the chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) signature requirement on several NFA forms almost nine years ago. At that time, ATF was reluctant to engage in a dialogue to address this issue and others that were considered to be important to the NFA and firearms communities. Although we had engaged in a productive and collaborative work environment before, ATF's reluctance forced us to retain counsel to file a formal petition to attempt to achieve meaningful discourse.  &gt;Once the petition was formally delivered, ATF began working with us on advancing the CLEO signature removal issue. We went through several issues requiring clarification and patiently observed the effort moving back and forth from ATF to DOJ over a period of years. In early 2012, ATF clearly demonstrated their intention to remove the CLEO signature requirement in RIN 1140-AA43, though they still had not consulted with us regarding the trust/corporate items. We awaited the formal rule-making process to begin. On August 28, 2013, the RIN was changed without notice. In addition, a lengthy draft of a proposed Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) was released.  &gt;While the NFATCA® has acknowledged in our petition that there is concern regarding prohibited persons receiving firearms without background checks via trusts and corporations, the draft NPRM does not reflect any discussions or negotiations we have had with the Federal Government regarding same. We did not support or advocate for the efforts of the Executive Branch that were recently published as the proposed NPRM. The proposed NPRM is being used as a political expedient to address areas of negligible concern. The Executive Branch proposals unduly burden the law- abiding public, will restrain lawful commerce and bury an already overwhelmed agency with an administrative infrastructure that will not serve the public safety interest.  &gt;The NFATCA® supports the elimination of the CLEO signature requirement. The NFATCA® is willing to engage with DOJ/ATF and the Executive Branch to investigate reasonable, effective and manageable approaches to preventing prohibited persons from acquiring firearms. We cannot and will not support the NPRM in its current form. We will vigorously challenge this NPRM when and if it is published during the mandatory public comment period required by the Federal Rule Making Process. The NFATCA® urges all of its members and the entire firearms community to do the same.   &gt;John K. Brown, III  &gt;President ",®

I agree he was given the boot unfairly but I think the board saw the exact same problem we all knew deep down-he couldn't take us any further. I don't think it was a case of him over achieving at spurs but more to do he gave us all he could. I remember how frustrating it would be when wining or drawing a game he would make a substitution that clearly indicated we were defending the scoreline. This would usually then lead us being pummeled for the last 20 mins (in a game we'd been holding our own) and ultimately end up losing.  T'was sad to see him go. Not so upset anymore😜,😜

t5_2qh16,xternal7,1377983053,"Patents != copyright.   Let's, for example, pretend I've written a story. Here's the basic outline, as generic as it can be:  * Bad guy kidnaps character B whom character A loved. * Character A sets off to a quest to find and free character A from the bad guy. * During his search, character A meets a forest witch that tells him that the bad guy keeps character B in a tower at $location. * [insert handful of notable events here, I'm jumping straight to the end] * Character A finds the bad guy and orders him to free character B. * Bad guy starts raging against ~~the machine~~ character A, shouting: ""fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"" * Seeing no other way, character A kills the bad guy. He still doesn't have a clue where the tower door is and how to get up there. * Character A (then finds a quarter furlong of rope), climbs the tower and saves the character B. * Insert 'happily ever after' ending.  This story is ©xternal7, 2013 All rights reserved dont u dare 2 copy mah story. Here's what you can't legally do, given the story is copyrighted:  * copy it word by word and publish it as your own work * torrent the shit out of it * IANAL but plagiarism sounds like something you shouldn't do either.  And here's what you can do, given the story is under copyright:  * You can write a story that recycles some parts of my story. For example, it's totally legal to you to write a story where character A and B go on a quest to rob the shit out of some bad guy.   In that story, friend of some bad guy kidnaps character B. Character A finds friend of some bad guy, kills him because that friend of SBG didn't tell him where character B is. So he looks for character B, finds him atop the tower, grabs the famous quarter furlong of rope, climbs the tower, saves character B. They then proceed to rob the shit out of some bad guy.   Because that's fundamentally different story. You can publish it, you can earn money on it and I can't do shit about it.  That was *copyright*. Now, let's focus on **patents**. Software patents, to be precise. This might be a slight over-generalization for pros but it will do for a layman. The thing is, you can't patent your program, but you can patent almost every single idea behind how the code gets executed. To continue with the story analogy, imagine that I could patent certain aspect of the story. For example, I patent this plot twist: ""character A kills character B with a weapon or magic for any reason"". Another example would be me patenting ""character A climbing a tower in order to save character C"". Now I've successfully patented these two things, you ***can't legally use them in a story***. What's the implication of this? See the story I said you could write above, given my story is under copyright you could still make money off your story because it's distinct enough from mine. But if I patent those two things, you can't legally write any story that would contain an element like the two examples I gave above and if you do, I can sue you for using my patented plot parts.  And now we return back to software patents, which are (for the most part) about as ridiculous as the examples I gave you. Slide to unlock, patent for drawing a line, patent for drawing a square, one-click purchase patent, patent for embedding content on websites, et cetera... To name the most ridiculous bunch. Nothing about preventing you from torrenting stuff. Abolishing software patents would mean that you wouldn't be able to get sued for embedding stuff on your webpage or putting something ridiculously trivial in your program. It wouldn't mean you'd get a green light at pirating software.  TL;DR: Pirating is a copyright infringement issue, not a patent infringement one.  Also, I've probably spent more time on that comment than it's worth it. Oh well.",©

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1377991020,"this RageChat™ installment was intentionally dismissive of the submission. the motivation behind that was to draw attention to the fact that this is indeed not a standard RageComic™ by positioning RageChat™ as an arbiter of RageComics™ that exists within narrow, well-defined boundaries.

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1377991664,"it's time for **RageChat™**  this brought up some pleasant memories for me; i think we've all been in this situation and appreciated it. the art style does very little to immerse me in the moment however, and the absence of any ""le poorly drawn"" memery strongly suggests that the artist wasn't being sly; they were just being a bad artist. ""these beauties"", indeed.  it's probably worth calling the usefulness of panel 3 into question entirely; panel 2 establishes that OP is enticed by the girl's breasts so the close-up feels unnecessary. i did appreciate the assurances that this is both a true story and a story designed for reddit users, however the relative simplicity of the narrative (a notorious problem with Me Gusta comics) remains a significant detractor.  **RageScore™**: 65",™

t5_2vgld,keflexxx,1377992506,"it's time for **RageChat™**  just when you think the Music Defener genre can't produce any more hits, another one rolls right along. this is the sort of Third-Wave Rage™ i can support; it pays homage to a well-loved genre while adding an original narrative element (misremembered lyrics). and for anyone who doubts this is Third-Wave Rage™, i advise you to keep your eyes peeled; the wilful overuse of the Harp Darp face in addition to the strategic placement of WeedComic™ faces in Panels 6 &amp; 7, the yoloswag back story &amp; the namedropping of Queensryche all suggest this in quite subtle ways. ultimately this is a comic that can be enjoyed both on its own merits and within the context of the TWR pantheon.  **RageScore™**: 80",™
